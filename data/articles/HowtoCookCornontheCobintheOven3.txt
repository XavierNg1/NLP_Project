 Switch on the broiler setting of your oven and allow the heating element to warm up for 5 to 10 minutes.


Some broilers only have on and off settings, while others also have high and low settings. If yours is the latter, switch the broiler onto high.
Place the upper oven rack roughly 6 inches (15 cm) away from the upper heating element of the oven. This upper heating element is the only portion that turns on when you use the broiler.
 Peel the husks back, revealing the entire ear of corn, but do not remove them. Instead, use scissors to cut the husks down to a length of roughly 4 inches (10 cm), then wrap the hanging husks in aluminum foil.


Pick away any hanging silks during this step, as well.
Wrapping the husks with foil is a necessary step. If you don't do this, the husks will quickly burn under the intense heat of the broiler and may even catch on fire.
If you don't wish to use the husks and stem as handles while serving the corn, you can remove them completely.
 Arrange the ears of corn in single layer on a baking sheet, then drizzle them with olive oil. If desired, you may also season the corn with salt and pepper.


You can cover the baking sheet with aluminum foil, if desired, but doing so is not necessary.
Note that olive oil is a better choice than butter for this method since it has a higher smoking point and will be less likely to overheat in the broiler.
 Place the ears of corn under the preheated broiler. Watch the corn carefully, and rotate the ears each time the kernels on that side begin charring.


You'll need to rotate the after the first 3 to 5 minutes, then twice more every 3 to 5 minutes after that. When ready, the corn should be lightly and evenly charred, and tender throughout.
Note that you can also remove the foil from around the husks during the last 2 minutes, if desired, so that they can char lightly without burning.
 Remove the corn from the oven and sprinkle it with chopped parsley, if desired. Serve it while it's still hot.

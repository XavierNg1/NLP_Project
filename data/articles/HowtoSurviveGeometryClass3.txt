 You will be more successful if you study throughout the course, practicing a little each night to make sure you understand the concepts. Like all math exams, to be successful on geometry tests you need to be able to apply skills that you have learned. You can cram to memorize formulas, but applying skills takes practice over time., There are a lot of formulas involved in geometry, and it can be difficult to keep them straight in your mind. So, it is helpful to have a notebook you use solely to organize your formulas (such as the Pythagorean Theorem, area of a circle, surface area of a cone, etc.). Include an illustration or example with each formula so that you can remember what it means.


You need to have a good understanding of all formulas as you progress in geometry. Certain formulas you learn at the beginning of the year may help you solve problems you need to solve at the end of the year. Often the test or textbook wonâ€™t tell you which formula you need to use, so the more formulas you have at your disposal, the more successful you will be.
Review your formula notebook regularly, not just before a test.
 There are numerous online resources for geometry help.

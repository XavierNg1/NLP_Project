 There are several different roles, includingÂ :


Melee Warriors, who use swords and axes in favor of blasters. They can take down enemies easily, but a well aimed shot is their downfall. They might carry a small sidearm.

Snipers, who use long-range rifles to shoot down enemies from behind cover.
Infantry, a warrior armed with a rifle and sidearm. These are the most numerous, and are well adapted to any situation.
Assassins, or spies. These can infiltrate the enemies base and quickly and silently take down an enemy or eavesdrop on their plans.
Scouts, who go ahead in the battle to try to see where the enemies are.

 Scraping off tint is simple, but only appropriate for side windows, since the rear windshield can be damaged by the razor blade. Both ordinary side windows and smaller "vent windows" can have tint removed this way.
 Sponge the interior of the window until it is dripping with soapy water. This protects the window from scratches, so make sure not to leave any dry patches.


Any mild soap will do, but you may wish to choose an unscented one.
You can protect upholstery using a cloth or tarp, or just open the car door before you begin.
 Purchase a brand new box of razor blades, since a sharp edge prevents scratches and you may blunt quite a few on each window. A locking scraper or other blade holder will make the process more convenient.
 Run the razor blade along one edge of the tint. Avoid scratching the dotted frit surrounding the tint.
 Use the blade edge to lift the cut tint, then pull it up. Most likely, it will tear into a few pieces, in which case you'll need to repeat the cut and lift until the entire edge is lifted from the glass.
 Remove the tint in sections by making long, straight cuts with the razor, then lifting and peeling off that section. Repeat until the window is free of tin.
 Look closely for remaining pieces of tint around the edges, and blobs of clear adhesive anywhere in the window. Apply more soapy water and use the razor blade to squeegee these off.

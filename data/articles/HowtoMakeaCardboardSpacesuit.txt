, It is recommended that you use the biggest box for this step. Be sure that it reaches down to your hips. If you are using a refrigerator box, you may have to cut some of it off.
 Cut out a hole on the top of the box, making sure that it is big enough for your head to fit through. For the arm holes, carve out holes on the sides of the box, leveling them out as best as you can. The more level your arm holes are, the better your suit will fit.
 Wrap cardboard around your limbs, and duct tape them there. Use two separate pieces for each limb. Secure one above and below the elbows and knees for easy bending. Tape both the inside and outside of the wraps to prevent your limbs from sticking to the tape.

 Use paint, crayons, or markers. Cut out shapes and fancy patterns from construction paper before gluing it to the cardboard. Allow your creativity to flow, and don't be afraid to experiment with new styles or patterns.


Be sure that the paint you use is safe for your skin.
 Add wires, tin foil, buttons, cooling coils, and other items that look like an astronaut would wear. Check your local hardware store for scraps and pieces to add to your spacesuit. However, beware of weighing yourself down with too many accessories.
 Find a small rectangular box that will fit on your back. Paint it silver before taping it to the back of your body box.

 Teach your child signs for words like “wet,” “dry,” “pee,” “poop,” or “need to go.” Use these signs each time you go to the restroom and when your child goes as well so they begin to understand their meaning. Sign “wet” when you change their diaper or “need to go” after lunch when they typically potty. Be consistent until they get the meaning of it., In addition to learning basic potty words, teach them other potty related terms as well. Terms like “wash hands” will be useful for your child to know and will help them establish an understanding of bathroom hygiene., Though you may have taught them these signs for them to use to signify when they need to potty, realize that when they need to potty, their brain might override that sign and they might signal with another gesture. Accept any gesture and praise them for informing you, especially if they make it to the potty without having an accident. Allow your child to communicate with you in whatever way they can., Another way to use language to communicate to your child via language is to use books. Read potty training books to your children and show them the pictures so they can better understand the concept of using the restroom properly. You might even try to find some videos or television shows to aid, as well. Some books you might purchase include:Once Upon A Potty
Everyone Poops
I Want My Potty

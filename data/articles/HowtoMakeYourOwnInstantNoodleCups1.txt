 Add the chicken stock concentrate, sesame oil, soy sauce, finely grated ginger, whole wheat spaghetti, frozen vegetables, shredded chicken, and toasted sesame seeds to a heat-safe mason jar or stoneware mug with a lid. Make sure to add the ingredients in the proper order.You can substitute zucchini or carrot noodles for the whole wheat pasta.
You can add whatever frozen vegetables you like. A mix made for stir fry that contains veggies such as carrots, peppers, broccoli, and/or water chestnuts is a good option.
If you don’t have leftover chicken to add to the jar, you can shred the meat from a grocery store rotisserie chicken.;
, Once all of the ingredients are in your container, place the lid on to seal it. Keep the container in your refrigerator until you are ready to eat.The instant noodles will keep in your refrigerator for 3 to 5 days.
If you’re bringing the noodles with you to work or school, make sure to throw a cold pack into your lunch bag to keep them cold.
 When you’re ready to eat the noodles, fill the container with boiling water to an 1-inch (2.5-cm) below the top. Place the lid on the container, and allow the noodles to steep for 2 to 3 minutes.If your container is microwave-safe, you can also add lukewarm water to the container and microwave it on high for 1 to 2 minutes.
 After you’ve allowed the noodles to steep for a couple of minutes, remove the lid. Use a spoon to stir the noodles and ingredients together well to ensure that the chicken stock concentrate has dissolved completely before eating.

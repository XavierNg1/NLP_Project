 Make sure to go to a restaurant both of you like. If you don't have a breakfast restaurant near you, you can make something together at home. Suggestions:


Eggs
Toast
French Toast
Donuts
or anything you both like best.;
, If there is a pond with ducks you can bring some bread, but make sure you are allowed to feed the ducks first. If there are fish, you could go fishing. When doing this also make sure you are allowed. Only go fishing if there are no ducks or geese living in the pond, if there are it increases the risk of a fishing hook getting caught on a duck or goose.
 Get some candy... this day is special.
, To save time, have your swimsuit on under your clothes.
 If you do not have a place near you that sells either of these you could go get ice cream.
 Again, make sure it is something both of you like.
 Make sure it is something you both agree on. Don't forget the popcorn!

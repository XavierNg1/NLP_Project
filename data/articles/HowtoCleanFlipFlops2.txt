 This is a quick solution, although it may use more water than other methods. Put the flip flops into the washing machine on a cold cycle, with a bit of soap and a quick program. If possible, choose a no-spin cycle. Be aware that too much detergent might damage the shoes., Use a water hose, a shower jet, or a powerful faucet to shoot water at the shoes. Try to knock dirt loose with water pressure. Keep going until you get most of the dirt off â€“ and try scrubbing afterward to complete the effect.

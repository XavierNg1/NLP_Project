 Look for one with a straight collar in simple colors like white or blue. Avoid bright, flashy hues or patterns.;
, Stick with medium to dark colors, especially navy blue, black, or gray.
 Buying the two as a set is ideal, but if you buy them separately, look for slacks that match the color of the jacket. Pants with a pleat down the front look especially professional, but plain front trousers will work, as well.
 A simple leather belt, in black or brown, holds your pants in place and keeps you looking well put together.
 Black leather is standard here, but a dark brown may also work if it coordinates better with your suit.
 While your socks may be hidden by your trouser legs for the majority of the day, they may occasionally peek out. Your socks should blend into your shoe. Avoid white socks, which look sloppy and casual.
 Stick with a long tie and avoid bow ties. Your tie can be a solid color or a simple pattern, but avoid anything flashy like pink flamingos or cartoon characters.

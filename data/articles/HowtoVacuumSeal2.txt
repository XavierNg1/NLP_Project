 Note the maximum fill line on your vacuum seal storage bags, and avoid overfilling them to keep them in the best shape. Your packed items should be dry, and you should avoid vacuum sealing objects with sharp corners or hard ridges., After filling your storage bag, take the zip slider firmly between your thumb and index finger. Run it down the length of the bag’s opening at least twice. Then check the ziplock seal with your fingers to ensure the bag is correctly sealed., After sealing the bag, locate the valve and remove the top cap.Place your vacuum hose directly over the valve. Turn the vacuum on, and watch as it starts to suck the air out of the storage bag., Once you’ve vacuumed out as much air as possible, your clothing, blankets, or other sealed item should have reduced in size by about half. Pop the cap back over the valve, put the vacuum away, and store your vacuum sealed bag in a safe place.Avoid storing a bag in a hot place or just throwing it in the closet. It might get damaged in high temperatures or if it accidentally hits a sharp object.

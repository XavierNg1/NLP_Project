 Open the small metal ring attached to your new pull with the round tip pliers and hook the open metal ring onto the end of the slider. Use round tip pliers to close the metal ring and secure the new pull in place.









If you’re on the road and don’t have a new pull or pliers, use a paperclip as a temporary pull. Simply slip the paperclip into the old pull or the slider itself., Slipping pants zippers are one of the most frustrating types of zipper problems. To create a temporary fix, attach a keyring onto the end of your zipper pull. Zip up the garment and hook the key ring around the button of your pants.
 If the zipper doesn't function correctly, you may be able to close it temporary by forcing both sides of the teeth together. To create a temporary fix, start at the bottom and move your way up until the zipper is closed.









If you have buttons to secure your garment, fasten them to help keep the zipper closed.

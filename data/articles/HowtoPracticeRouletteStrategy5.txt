 Ian Fleming, the famous author of the James Bond series, claimed that his "foolproof" system could get you the “price of a good dinner” if you used it every night. To use the James Bond strategy, you need at least $200. You're going to be making what's called a column bet.
,,, If you're unlucky and any number between 1 and 12 pockets, you've lost your money and should begin employing the martingale strategy (see above). But otherwise, you've gained a handsome profit:









If 19-36 pockets, you've won $80
If 13-18 pockets, you've won $100
If 0 pockets, you've won $160

 Landlord/tenant law is very detailed and confusing. If you can afford a local attorney who knows the ins and outs of your stateâ€™s landlord/tenant laws, it would be best to hire one. See https://www.wikihow.com/Find-a-Good-Attorney.
 Ensure that everything that was agreed upon is in the written lease. If a term is not in the lease, it will likely not be enforced if you have to go to court. If the landlord provides a form lease, review it for all terms. Have your attorney review it if you have any questions. Ask for changes if the written lease does not reflect your oral agreement. If you are writing your own lease, you can find sample commercial leases by searching for commercial leases in your state online. Since landlord/tenant and contract law are state laws, be sure the sample you use has been written specifically for use in your state., A lease for greater than one year must be signed by all parties to be enforceable. Even for a lease of less than one year, a signed lease is higher proof of the agreement than simple testimony., If a disagreement arises, the courts will likely require a copy of the contract signed by all parties to be filed with the court.

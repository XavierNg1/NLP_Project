 The vet should examine your cat to determine its body shape and energy needs. The vet will decide how much food your cat needs based on its ideal body weight. If your cat is overweight, you can discuss how much weight your cat needs to lose and if you need to reduce meal sizes.If you can't talk with the vet about your cat's weight, you should read the cat food package to determine the correct portion size for your cat based on age and weight.;
, While most commercial cat foods are developed to give balanced nutrition, they're made for different stages of your cat's life. Choose a cat food that says it meets all the health requirements established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and pick one based on your cat's life stage. Examples of ages and activity levels include:Kittenhood
Adulthood (senior cat)
Pregnancy and lactation

, If you'd like to change the commercial cat food you give your pet, ask for recommendations from the vet. They may recommend that you add some wet food to your cat's diet if you're currently only feeding dry food. If you'd like to feed your cat a mix of wet and dry food, avoid just adding the wet food. You'll need to reduce the amount of dry food you offer, so your cat doesn't overeat.Your cat needs about 24 to 35 calories for each pound it weighs, so take this into account when deciding what foods to offer.
 It's important to pay attention to all of the food you're feeding your cat, including treats. Treats are fine to occasionally give to your cat, but they shouldn't make up more than 10 to 15% of your cat's overall diet. To keep your cat a healthy weight, avoid giving these treats:Raw meat
Milk
Food scraps

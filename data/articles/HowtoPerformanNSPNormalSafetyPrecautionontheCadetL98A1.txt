 The safety catch is situated just above the trigger guard. If you can see the red ring on the left side of the rifle, then the safety is off. If you can't see the red ring, the rifle is safe.
 Also make sure that the rifle is firmly on your shoulder at all times., The holding open catch looks like a small, green, switch on the right-hand side of the rifle., Complete your 7-point-check.,, With your right hand on the pistol grip and your left hand on the front grip (the long bit of green plastic), press the safety catch with the right forefinger until you can see the red ring on the left-hand side of the rifle., Re-apply the safety catch. Make sure the sights (which are on top of the carrying handle), are down. Put the dust cover up. The dust cover is a small bit of green* plastic (*commonly green but not always) near the rear of the rifle. With your left hand over the top of the rifle, flip the dust cover up and slide it back, into position. Look through the sights to a safe target (where no living thing is at risk) and slowly pull the trigger to ensure the action is fired off and that there are no live rounds in the weapon.

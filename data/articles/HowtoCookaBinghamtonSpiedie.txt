In the Binghamton areas there are many different types of marinating sauces at local grocery stores made specifically for Spiedies.
If you have a personal recipe for marinating sauce, using that will make your Spiedie unique.



If you are only going to marinate it overnight, using a heavy duty zip lock bag would be fine.
For longer than 24hrs, it is best to use a Tupperware bowl, it is more secure and prevents the risk of leaking.



The length of time it sits and marinates can very. Some people let it sit for only 24hrs and other for over a week. It all depends on your preference and the amount of time you have.



Adding vegetables such as mushrooms, chopped green and red peppers, etc. in between each individual Spiedie gives it more flavors.
 Leave the handle hanging over the edge, allowing easy rotation.


If you are a person who doesn't like charred grill lines, placing tinfoil on the grill and cooking on that helps reduce the char lines.
Cooking on tinfoil helps keep moisture on the Spiedies by preventing the sauce from dripping in between the grill.



Rotate the Spiedies every so often to prevent burning and even cooking.
When cooking the Spiedies, make sure you pay attention, if they end up over cooked, they have the tendency to dry out.



When taking the Spiedie of the skewer, a good way to do it is using the bread or bun to grip the Spiedie as you pull the skewer out.

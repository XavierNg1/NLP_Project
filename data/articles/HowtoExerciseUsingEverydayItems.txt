Use a director's chair.
Put it about 8 in. from a bed and take off the back of the chair.
Then lean your back down, against the bed, hold the "handles" on the back of the chair and lift them up and down, again and again, just moving is good for you.;
,, If you are in secondary/high school, fill a satchel/rucksack with a large amount of textbooks, and lift it, so that your arm is in the position that you would use to show off your biceps. Only bend your elbow, don't use your shoulder. You could add more books, the stronger you get.
 lay down on your bed with your feet flat on the ground and try them. the flexible surface of the bed makes it way easier!

, If you need to keep an eye on the stove and your hands are empty, try push-ups at the edge of the counter top.


Step a few steps away from the counter, keep your feet flat on the floor, back straight, lean forward with your hands on the edge of the counter (you may need a towel to cushion your hands) and do your push-ups slowly to get the maximum benefit.
, You never know what you can come up with!

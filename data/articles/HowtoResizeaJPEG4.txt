 There is no built-in way to resize a picture on iOS devices, but there are a variety of apps that can perform the task for you. You can download these apps from your iOS device's App Store. Some of the more popular apps include:


Resize It
Image Resizer+
Desqueeze

, You'll likely be prompted to give the app access to your photos. This is necessary for the app to be able to browse the photos stored on your device. Find the photo you want to resize and tap it to open it.
 Most apps have various tools you can choose from, including resizing. Tap the "Resize" button to begin resizing the image.
 Different apps will have different interfaces, but generally you can select from a variety of preset sizes or you can enter your own custom resolution. The width and height will be linked, so that the proportions are maintained.


If you don't mind if the image gets stretched or squished, you can tap the chainlink or padlock button to enter different values into each field.
 After resizing the image, tap the "Save" button to save it to your camera roll. You'll be able to find it in your Photos app like you would any other image on your iOS device.

 A pie chart is useful for dividing data into distinct categories, or looking at the parts of a larger whole. You can use a pie chart to compare as small as two categories and as large as seven categories.You should also use a circle graph if there is a significant amount of difference in your data. For example, 10 people who prefer rabbits and only 2 people who prefer dogs.
If you are trying to show changes or shifts in a category over a long period of time, for example, year to year, you will need to create multiple pie charts, one for each year.
 Nominal data is data that can be categorized by descriptive or qualitative information. It is data that can be named, or made nominal. For example, a country of birth or a type of pet would be nominal data.Ordinal data is data that is set in a specific order. It can also be named and easily categorized but it is ranked, from lowest to highest, or from biggest to smallest, etc. For example, the hottest time of the year or the most popular movie genre would be ordinal data.
 Pie charts are often used as tools in presentations or talks, especially for a large crowd. Pie charts are great visual tools and can allow you to present data in a way that is easy to understand and comprehend. Often, pie charts are used to demonstrate distinctions between groups or preferences between different individuals.

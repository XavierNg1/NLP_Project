 He/she will say their name.;
,, Furby will move his/her ears and beak in a certain way depending on what their name is. For example, for Doo-Moh, he will move his ears down twice. For Toh-Loo-Kah, he will move his ears down slightly twice, and all the way down once.
 This will depend on how many times you hear the gears move. If his gears move 3 times, his name clearly isn't Boo or Dah.

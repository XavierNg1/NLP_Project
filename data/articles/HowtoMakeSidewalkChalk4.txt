 Combine Â½ cup (120 milliliters) of water with 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of washable tempera paint. Stir the water with a spoon until the color is even. There should be no streaks.


For stronger colors, use more paint. Use less for lighter or pastel colors.
 Stir well until all of the powder has dissolved. Make sure that there are no clumps or streaks. The mixture should still be a liquid at this point, but it should be much thicker than standard paint.
 Gently sift the trays back and forth with your hands to bring any air bubbles to the surface.


If you want to get creative, use ice cube molds or freezable candy molds with fun-shaped compartments, such as stars or fish.
Alternatively, you can pour the liquid chalk into popsicle molds. Don't fill the molds all the way; the liquid will expand as it freezes. Insert the tops of the molds into the liquid chalk, snapping them in place., Carefully place the ice cube trays in your freezer. Make sure that they are sitting flat, or the tops will freeze crooked. Leave the trays in the freezer undisturbed until the chalk freezes. This will take several hours.
 Pour them into a bowl. If you made several different colors, you might want to separate the cubes by color. If you used popsicle molds, simply pull the popsicles out.
 You can draw with the ice chalk as you would with normal chalk. You can also leave the chalk on the sidewalk and let it melt into colorful puddles.


Note that ice chalk will melt as you play with it, so it can get pretty messy.
The colors may seem dull or translucent at first. Once the water dries, however, the colors become more vibrant.

 While the Atkins diet promotes weight loss, it is important to lose that weight gradually in order to keep your gout in check. When you lose weight at a rapid pace, your uric acid levels can increase, causing your gout to flare up. To lose weight gradually, create a regular exercise routine and eat healthy.To read more about create a health exercise routine, click here.
 As mentioned previously, it is important to lose weight slowly in order to keep your gout from being exacerbated. To do this, set a long term weight loss goal for yourself. Try to lose about one to two pounds each week, rather than starving yourself to drop a bunch of weight at once (which is very unhealthy).


To help you stay on track, record your weight loss goals and advances in a journal. You can also use an app on your phone to help you keep track of what you eat each day, and help you to visualize your goal.
 When trying to be both Atkins and gout friendly, it is important to drink plenty of water. Staying hydrated will help you to dilute the uric acid in your blood so that it can be eliminated more easily through your urine.


While everyone needs to drink a different amount of water, in general, an average adult woman should try to drink 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water each day, while an average adult man should try to drink 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water each day., To live both an Atkins and gout friendly lifestyle, you should try to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, or stop drinking it at all. Alcohol can increase the level of toxic substances in your body, which can slow down the secretion of uric acid.


Limit yourself to one or two drinks when you are not experiencing an attack of gout, and cut it out entirely when you are experiencing a gout attack.

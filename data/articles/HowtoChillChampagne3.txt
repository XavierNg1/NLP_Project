 If you're in a pinch and need to chill champagne quickly, you can add salt to ice to speed up the chilling process. The salt draws heat out of the bottle of champagne, making it cool faster. To start, add some ice to a bucket of water. Add enough ice that, after adding about half a cup of water, you can submerge a bottle of champagne., Take a salt container and open the lid. Quickly shake the container over the ice, getting a generous amount in the bucket., About half a cup of tap water will usually do. You'll need to add enough that the ice is floating in the water, sort of like cereal in milk., The champagne will cool quickly using this method. You only need to leave the bottle in the ice for a few minutes. It should cool off sufficiently in roughly 3 to 5 minutes., Remember to point the bottle away from breakable objects when un-corking the champagne. Tilt the bottle at a 45 degree angle when serving and fill a cup about three quarters of the way full.

 If you currently have syphilis, it is essential that you protect others from the disease, even if you are already on antibiotics. The disease may still be transmitted during treatment, even when physical symptoms are not present. If you are infected, it is your responsibility to avoid all sexual contact (oral, anal, and vaginal sex) during treatment to prevent transmission of the disease.If you have sores on your mouth, then you should not even kiss anyone because the disease may pass through the sores., This includes former partners who may have been exposed to your infection prior to treatment. It is essential all partners are informed so that they can seek testing and treatment if necessary, or decide to decline sexual interaction with you until you are completely free of the illness. Failure to do so may increase risk of transmission., This barrier method may help prevent transmission of syphilis during treatment. Make sure that you use condoms during all acts of vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Keep in mind that condom use is only effective if all of the affected areas are covered to prevent contact with the mucus membranes or broken skin of a sexual partner.Make sure that you use dental dams or latex barriers when performing oral sex on a female partner.

 A typical bra has two horizontal straps that fasten in the back. One strap has several pairs of eyelets. The other has one pair of hooks that attach to the eyelets. To undo a bra, you must pinch both sides together and slide the hooks out of the eyelets.









Occasionally you may come across a bra that only has one eyelet and one hook, or five eyelets and five hooks. While two or three eyelets and hooks are standard, all of the eyelet-hook bras can be undone in the same way.;
, While these types of bras are not as common as bras that clasp in the back, they do exist. These types of bras have cups that connect with a clasp at the front. So, if you’re trying to undo a bra and can’t seem to find eyelets and hooks at the back, chances are the bra connects in the front.

 Before you proceed with the organization of your shed, wait until a dry day and drag everything outside.


Check the shed's structure carefully for any signs of damage and water entry.






Examine the contents you took outside carefully for any signs of water damage, as this may indicate a leak you can’t see.






Check for any pest attack, such as moth damage to any fabric stored in the shed.






Make sure that all chemicals are sealed, the containers are undamaged, and the labels are still legible. Repair any structural damage to the shed and give it a sweep out before you put everything back inside.






If it begins raining while your shed's contents are outdoors, throw a tarpaulin over the contents.






Also, remember that chemicals should never be left in hot or direct sunlight, and mustn’t be allowed to leak into the ground or water.

, You should sort through the contents of your shed and throw out anything that is unnecessary or past its usefulness. If you aren’t sure how to declutter, follow these simple rules:


First, admit you aren’t going to get around to fixing any broken items.
Then get rid of anything broken!
Safely dispose of any chemicals that have passed their expiry dates.
Get rid of anything you haven’t used for 2 years.
If you are fortunate enough to have duplicates of useful items, celebrate your good luck by donating them to people less fortunate than you.
 Garden tools tend to come in all shapes and sizes, and so does the rest of the contents of many peoples’ sheds.

Bundle some Velcro wrap around collections of garden canes or longer hand tools such as hoes and spades. This will hold them together.






Use tall boxes to store long tools that you rarely use.

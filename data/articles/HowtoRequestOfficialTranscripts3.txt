 Look on your institution’s official website for the transcript request form. Print the form and fill out all the necessary information.


On the form, you will need to specify how many transcripts you are requesting. Most offices will allow you to order up to five official transcripts at a time.
You may also need additional documents attached to your official transcripts, such as forms for the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS), or the Pharmacy College Application Service(PHARMCAS). Complete any additional forms and bring them with you so they can be added to your official transcript package.
 Though this may mean you will need to take time out of your day to wait in line at your university’s records and enrollment office, this is often the best option if you need to receive your transcripts as soon as possible.


Take the completed form with you so it can be processed by the admissions and enrollment office.
 The cost for official transcripts varies from university to university, but they are often around $10-$15 per transcript. Most enrollment offices will take cash, credit, or debit for payment.
 Once you have paid the fee and your transcripts have been processed, you will need to show picture ID to pick up the transcripts.

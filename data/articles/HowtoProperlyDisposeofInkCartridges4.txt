 There are a number of independent charities or programs that will accept or even pay money for spent cartridges. Think about a cause you want to support but also keep in mind the scale. Often these organizations are targeting businesses for donations.


Some organizations may have volume or frequency minimums in order to use their service.
 Whichever program you settle on, most require that you enroll in order to donate. Typically there is a simple web-form you can fill out to register.
 Once youâ€™re signed up, most organizations will send you shipping supplies and instructions on how to donate.

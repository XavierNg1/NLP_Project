 Assemble your collection of records and make sure that your record player is in good functioning condition.;
, In order to record from vinyl, you'll need to make sure you have accurately connected your record player as an incoming audio stream into the microphone jack of your computer.


Use hardware adapters to secure your cable connection. Many older record players utilize a 1/4-sized input jack. The modern laptop computer, as well as many desktop models, use a smaller, 1/8-sized input jack. You can buy simple adapters at your local electronics store to fix this problem.
Make sure that your cables and adapters support stereo.
 You will see the signature Audacity screen, with controls at the top, and an empty space to accommodate created tracks.
,, You should see the track being populated with sound, represented by a fluctuating line as the cursor moves along.

Adjust volume as necessary. The volume from the microphone jack may be insufficient to record the sound well. Adjust the volume and other aspects in order to optimize your incoming sound.
 Reset the record player, start playing and hit the Audacity "Record" button again, allowing the entire track to populate with the sound of the vinyl record.
 Audacity supports a number of file formats for the finished product. You can select one of these when you have recorded the entire track. Make every song its own track, or simply record the entire side of the record on one track.

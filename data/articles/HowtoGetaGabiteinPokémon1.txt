 This is required to access the cave where Gibles can be found in Diamond and Pearl, but is not required for Platinum. You can get Strength at the Lost Tower. You'll also need Cut, which you'll get in Eterna City.
 This is the cycling road between Eterna City and Route 207., From the Route 207 end of the road, head up the right side, using Cut to get past the trees blocking the way. Walk all the way up the right side to find the main cave entrance. Ignore this entrance; you'll need to find the secret entrance to find a Gible., This is the only location you can find the Gible. You'll need to use Strength in Diamond and Pearl to enter this cave., It may take a few battles for one to appear., Lower the Gible's health and use a Poke Ball like you would any other wild Pokemon. The Gible's level will be between 15-20., If you're playing Platinum, you can find a Gabite on Victory Road at the end of the game. It has a 5% chance of appearing, so it may take a while to encounter. The Gabite will be Level 41., Gible will evolve into Gabite when it reaches Level 24. The quickest way to raise Gible's level is to use it in as many battles as possible. If you have some Rare Candy, each one will raise Gible's level by one., As soon as your Gible reaches Level 24, it will attempt to evolve into Gabite. Make sure not to cancel the evolution.

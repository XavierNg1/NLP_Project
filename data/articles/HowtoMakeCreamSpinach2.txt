 That's code for grabbing your cutting board, knife and veggies.

Cut the onion in half. Make vertical slices very close together. Then, rotate it and cut it the other way to dice it.
Mince your garlic finely. Once you think it's small enough, do it a teeny bit more.
 Put in 1 stick of butter over medium-low heat. If your stove runs a bit colder, put it on medium.

Once the butter is melted, add in 8 tablespoons (90 g) of flour.
Immediately start whisking and cook for five minutes. It should turn golden brown.
Add garlic and onions to your roux. Stir together to combine and cook for another minute.
Slowly add in 2 cups (475 ml) of milk. Whisk constantly. Cook it for 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally. It should start to thicken.
 If you have another pair of hands at your disposal, make him or her whisk the cream sauce while you do the spinach.

Put 3 tablespoons of butter into a pot and let it melt.
Throw in as much of the spinach as you can. As it heats, it will shrivel and shrink and you'll be able to add more. This may take a few additions. Stir it well, flipping it to cook it evenly.
You want to stop cooking the spinach when itâ€™s completely wilted but not mushy and overcooked. Grab a leaf from the pan and give 'er a taste test. It should be cooked and wilted, but still have a tiny bit of crunch to it.
 By now it should be thick like gravy.

Spoon the spinach into the cream. Stir it gently to entirely incorporate the greens into the creaminess. Try it before you deem it too creamy or to vegetable-y. Also, if you want to spice it up, add some cayenne. Then serve!

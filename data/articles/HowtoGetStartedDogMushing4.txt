 Patience and practice are key for streamlining your sled dog team. Allow bonding time for you and your dogs (e.g. devote time to spending time outdoors playing with your new sled dogs) and take advantage of your dogs' natural instinct to pull to make training a fun experience. If the process does not happen naturally as you continue taking your dogs out to practice, enlist the aid of a fellow musher who might have advice on how to get your team into gear.Note that your new sled dogs will need time to get accustomed to the sound of your voice, and to build trust.
 Teach or reinforce basic commands to establish your dominance non-violently, and to gain your dogs' respect and trust. To start, review and practice the five basic commands:"Sit”,"Stay", "Lay down”, ”Heel”, and "Come here.” Visit the American Kennel Club website at http://www.akc.org/content/dog-training/articles/teach-your-puppy-these-5-basic-commands/ for instructional details and videos.
 The most important part of training a dog team is to get the dogs to learn each others' rhythms and work together. To achieve this, run the dogs as much as possible for practice before events or races. If your team slows down at difficult points (e.g. steep hills), be firm and make them work harder to get over the hurdles. This is the best way to ensure that they will not be overwhelmed during a race, and less likely to hesitate in such situations in the future.Always reward your dogs' perseverance and accomplishments with ample praise.

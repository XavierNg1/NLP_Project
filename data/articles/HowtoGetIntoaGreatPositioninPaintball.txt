 But you will want take more of a horizontal then vertical angle doing a superman slide (head first slide) about 10 feet (3.0Â m) away from the entry point, thus having you already using the snake as cover without being in it.;
,, It is best to slide in on your knees since it allows you to get down low behind it and immediately start firing.
 then bump up all the way while making stops along the way. If you can eliminate the back players directly down the field your life will be so much easier. Look ahead before you start shooting people down on the other side of the field.<When you get in you'll want to be shooting your tape ( the boundaries) If someone else on the other team is in, know where they are. br>

, If there are other bunkers along the way, make sure you know the other side is clear before going around them.
 Usually when you are at the 50 you can shoot cross field to the 50 dorito and hit his back side.
 After making sure the area is safe, dash across assuming 2-3 people on the other team are left. You may have already 3 eliminations. the opposing snake player, 50 dorito, and the back player directly in front of you. Now assume that the snakes on your right side, so the people left are in the middle back or possibly the 30 dorito.That's perfect everyone is on the other side of the field so prepare for your Ollie Lang run. Run them down getting the final two eliminations.

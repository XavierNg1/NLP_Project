 When you’re done, orient them so that they’re taller than they are wide.
 Since your cardboard is 2 feet (0.6 m) wide, you should be able to make four equal folds. When you’re done, you’ll have a square “column.” Repeat with the second piece of cardboard.
 This can be done with a stencil or you can paint the gray grout lines and add in red bricks later on. This will look rough, but real bricks don't look perfect anyway.
 These will become your base and mantle, so size them accordingly.
 You may want to use some Styrofoam to give the mantle and base some thickness; if this is the case, paint these the same color.
 Aileen's Craft Glue is a great glue for this purpose. Take care that the tape and glue are only on the back side of the piece and do not show from the front.
 Paint black/gray bricks on this one to make it look as if it has been charred/smoked. A sponge is a great tool for the grungy look.
 Place an electric light source (like an electric candle or extension cord with a night light port) inside the cavity of the fireplace. You can also place small logs over the electric candles so only their flames can be seen. Any logs obtained from the woods look great, and work well to add to a realistic feel. (Store bought formed fireplace logs are not suggested as they look fake and tend to be made to be MORE flammable.) Of course, you can always paint the flames in as well.

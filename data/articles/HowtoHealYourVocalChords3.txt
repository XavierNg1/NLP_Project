 Pour six cups of water into a pot. Place the pot on the stove and set the heat to medium-high. Once the water starts to steam or evaporate (about eight to ten minutes), turn off the heat and take the pot off the stove.Water that is 150 degrees Fahrenheit will provide enough steam.
If the water is boiling then it is too hot. Let the water cool for a minute or two before you begin the steam inhalation.
 Place a bowl on a table and pour the hot water into it. You may add herbal extracts to the water at this point. Add five to eight drops of extract to the water.You can add herbal extracts like chamomile, thyme, peppermint, lemon, oregano, and clove to the water for added benefits.
 While you are sitting, lean over the bowl at a comfortable distance away from the steam. Place a towel over your head, shoulders, and the bowl to create an enclosure.This will trap the steam so you can breathe it in.
 You only need to breathe the steam in for eight to ten minutes for this to be effective. Set a timer to keep track of the time. Once you have finished the steam inhalation, try not speak for 30 minutes afterwards. This will enable your vocal chords to rest and heal after the procedure.

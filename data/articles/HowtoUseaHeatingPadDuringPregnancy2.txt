 Some women find that cool treatments improves the pain relief or inflammation if used first. If you experienced a specific and minor injury to your lower back, use a cold compresses to treat the pain for the first few days. Start with a pre-made ice pack or cold compress to cool the area. Leave the pack on for no more than 20 minutes before taking the compress off., Instead of a pre-made muscle ice pack, you can make your own cold compress by filling a Ziploc bag with ice, filling a water bottle with cold water, wetting a washcloth with cold water, or grabbing a bag of frozen vegetables and wrapping it in a towel. These can be applied to the skin instead of treatments with a heating pad.


The same time limit applies to these methods as well. Skin that are exposed to cold conditions for too long can develop frostbite., Switching back and forth between warm and cool treatments may relieve muscle or backaches more quickly, and alternating the two treatments may help prevent overheating your skin.


Cooling your skin and muscle before applying the heating pad may help the pad seem warmer on a lower setting.

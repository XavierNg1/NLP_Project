 Maintain your hair at a volume-friendly length. A blunt short to medium haircut will make your hair seem more poofy. Opt instead for a super short hairstyle, like a pixie cut, or a longer hairstyle that sits below your shoulders.A long bob is an ideal hairstyle for your thick, voluminous hair!;
, Adding long layers to your thick, unruly, or wavy hair will reduce the appearance of volume. Longer layers are always recommended over shorter layers--the shorter the layer, the more volume it will create! In addition to reducing the volume of your hair, long layers also create movement in your thick tresses., Have your stylist use thinning shears to reduce the volume of your unruly hair or do it yourself at home. Before you start the process, make sure your hair is dry. Divide your hair into fistful sized sections. Grab one section of hair and close the thinning shears halfway down the length of your hair shaft Open the shears slightly and move them down the length of your hair. Stop half an inch above the ends of your hair. Once you have thinned a section, comb through your hair a few times to determine if you have achieved your ideal thickness. Repeat as needed before moving on to the next section.

Do not start the thinning process too close to your roots! You may over thin your hair. Instead, begin lower on the shaft and work up towards the roots if needed.
Try to thin all of the sections evenly. Comb through the sections to assess your progress. Even out any sections that are too thick., Hair that is left untrimmed will eventually get split or damaged ends. This leaves you with a mass of volume at the ends of the hair shafts. Clean up the ends of your hair with regular trims--see your stylist every 2 to 4 months.

 Depictions of ice queens tend to show a woman who cares about her appearance down to the last detail. Good grooming is essential for giving off an aura of royalty., Anything white or pale blue is ideal for an ice queen look. This can be given a boost with such colors as red, pale pink and pastels.


Sparkly additions can make colors shine forth more but don't overdo sparkly accessories in case it looks tacky.
 Always wear a dress for a formal event. Something short with lots of tulle is nice, and if it isn't very ice queen like, you can always put a tutu under your dress and let a bit of tulle show out from underneath.


A ballerina or a fairy is a nice inspiration for the look.
If you're thinking more royal, you can try an Elizabethan era gown, in either pastels, with, or red.
 Downplay fancy elements––these aren't needed when you're wearing casual. Keep the clothes well fitted and neat.

Avoid hoodies and anything really baggy. Form-fitting is best because baggy stuff will appear to weigh you down.






You can wear pastel or white colored skinny jeans, tutus, shorts over tights, or anything that isn't too baggy or dark looking.
For shoes, flats or small kitten heels are best. Don't wear stripper heels, ever.

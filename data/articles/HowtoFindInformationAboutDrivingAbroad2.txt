 In addition to checking with your insurance company directly, contact your credit card company as well. Many major credit card companies include insurance coverage for rental cars. If they do, use your card to reserve your rental and receive these benefits.Ask your credit card company about what is and isn’t covered, and consider adding to the coverage through the car rental company
Be aware that some countries require coverage for theft, which you pay to the rental car company., For instance, ask if anything specific is required to drive along the route you’ll be taking, or if there is any additional information you should know. Further, ask about whether you can take the vehicle into other countries.Simply say something along the lines of, “Will my insurance cover me if I cross an international border?”
It’s best to share your anticipated itinerary with the rental car company to prevent unexpected fines or a potential lack of coverage.
 There are a few assumptions about renting a car that you should avoid. Perhaps foremost, do not assume you can return the vehicle at any time, or in any location. Some rental companies will charge you a fee for returning a vehicle outside of certain hours, or for returning it to an unspecified location.Additionally, do not assume the cheapest option is the best. For one - it will likely be a manual transmission. If you do not know how to drive a stick shift, don’t assume you’ll be able to learn while driving abroad.

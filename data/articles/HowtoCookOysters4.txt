 Put on gloves so that the rough exterior of the shells don't scrape your hands while you wash any grit and grime from the oysters. Wash the oysters in a place where the runoff won't damage any of your yard and/or equipment.


Again, wash your oysters immediately before you plan on roasting them. Washing oysters too early before cooking can kill them, making them inedible.
Oysters from a purveyor are often washed when they are harvested, but it won't hurt to give them a once-over. You're better safe than sorry.
 In order to have a traditional oyster roast, you'll need a good sized fire and a big piece of sheet metal. If you don't have a piece of sheet metal, you can use a piece of metal grating, so long as the grating is small enough to contain the oysters.


Place four cinder blocks at the edge of your fire, positioned rectangularly so that they'll easily support the sheet metal when fitted over the fire.
Once the fire begins to die down, place your sheet metal on top of the cinder blocks and wait for it to get hot. (Of course, make sure your sheet metal is properly washed beforehand.) If splashing a couple drops of water onto the sheet metal causes the water to sizzle and disintegrate, the surface is ready to go.
 Make sure you have enough oysters. Budget anywhere from 6 - 16 oysters per person.
 Although burlap sacks work a little better than towels (and won't look unbecoming when they get steamed), towels are perfectly acceptable.


Give the batch of oysters anywhere from 8 to 10 minutes to finish cooking. If you prefer oysters to be less cooked, aim for about 8 minutes. If you prefer your oysters to be more cooked, aim to keep them under the burlap sack for a couple more minutes.
Throw away any oysters that haven't opened 1/4" to 1/2" after 10 minutes.
 The sheet should take a handful of minutes to properly heat up. Repeat process over again when sheet metal is hot enough to receive a new batch of oysters.

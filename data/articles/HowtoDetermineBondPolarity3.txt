 By definition, a non polar bond must be covalent. That means that electrons are shared evenly from one atom to the next. A truly nonpolar bond has a negativity difference of zero between the two atoms.For example, hydrogen gas (H2) forms a nonpolar bond between the two hydrogen atoms because they have the exact same electronegativity.
 Polar covalent bonds are formed when you have two atoms with similar (but not identical) electronegativities. This generally happens between two nonmetals, and has a weak dipole. These bonds have an electronegativity difference that is greater than zero, but less than two.For example, a carbon hydrogen bond is weakly polar, making it a polar covalent bond.
 Ionic bonds usually form between metals and non metals. When each atom ionizes to an anion or cation, there is a strong dipole. Ionic bonds have atoms with an electronegativity difference greater than two.Bonds between calcium and chlorine are ionic.

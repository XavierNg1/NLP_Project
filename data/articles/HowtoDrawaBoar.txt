 Sketch a circle and a trapezoid with curved-in sides as shown. Add faint guidelines for features, where the ears and snout will be.
 Add spades for the ears and small, upward-curving triangles for the tusks., Add in a set of two ovals for each leg; don't forget to draw hooves. Add in a thin, tufted tail., Erase guidelines so that the primary focus becomes the detailing of the body. Also emphasize the shape hooves more, although you should keep them very small to the rest of the boar., Use dark colors, and use shadowing/highlighting to make it look more realistic.,

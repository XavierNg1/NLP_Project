 Remove any wool or cloth so your cat can't suck on it. You may need to stop wearing wool sweaters around your cat and store any projects that use wool (such as your knitting or crocheting). This is especially important if you have valuable wool items that you don't want your cat to destroy.Don't forget to keep cloth holiday or party decorations out of reach. For example, your cat may be interested by decorations that contain fringe so hang them high out of reach.;
, If your cat finds wool or another unapproved item to suck on, remove the item, firmly say "no", and tap your cat on the nose. Do this each time you see your cat sucking on something it shouldn't. Your cat will soon learn that this is undesirable behavior.Never yell or get angry at your cat. Keep in mind that your cat is probably sucking because it's trying to relieve anxiety.
 Cats that suck on wool are usually very hungry. Instead of giving your cat one or two main meals a day, set out several smaller meals. You can also support your cat's hunting instincts by hiding dry food or putting it into puzzle feeders or treat balls.Hunting for food may also distract your cat from the wool sucking behavior.

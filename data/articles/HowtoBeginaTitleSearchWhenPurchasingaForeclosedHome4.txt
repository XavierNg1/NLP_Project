 If you already work with an attorney, see if they can help you with the title search. If they are not a real estate attorney, ask for a referral to someone else who might be able to help you.
 If you have acquaintances who have recently been through the house-buying process, see if they can give you the name of an attorney they worked with. Ask if they were pleased with the service, and get some idea of the likely cost.
 Everyone who is an attorney does not necessarily do real estate work, and every real estate attorney may not be experienced in the field of title searches. If you are going to be paying for their service, ask ahead about their experiences to find someone who will really be able to help you.
 If you conducted your own initial title search, whether through a commercial online company or by yourself through public records, it is a good idea to review the information with an attorney. For example, you may have found that a mechanic’s lien was recorded in 1995, and there was another foreclosure sale (before yours) in 2002. How will you know if that mechanic’s lien still exists? Check with an attorney for details.

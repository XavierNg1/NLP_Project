 This means you hop on your back foot (the left) and point with your right in quick succession. Then, hop again with your back foot and bring your right behind (bending sharply at the knee) and place your toe on the floor.


When you think of it, it should be more of a point-hop-toe (if you were to utter it aloud). The first hop is on the same beat as the point.
 With your left foot (the one firmly planted on the ground at this juncture), do a small hop, crossing your right in front on 1. On 2, step with your left and on 3, bring your weight forward on your right. Always keep your feet crossed and toes pointed.
 At the end of your right point-hop-toe, swing your left around to lead. Repeat in the same fashion, always keeping your knees up, toes pointed, and feet crossed.
 On count 1, hop with your right, landing on 2, crossing over with your left on 3, and moving to the right until 7. You'll be making 6 steps to the right, finishing on your left foot.
 This is the same thing, only on count 1 hop with your right, crossing behind your left. Move to the left until 7, finishing on your right.
 Just as in every other Irish step, discussed, repeat the same pattern but with the left foot starting. You'll want to do 7s to the left for starters, and then 7s to the right.


When you finish, end in the opening position.

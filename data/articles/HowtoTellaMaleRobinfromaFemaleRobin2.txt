 Males are black with prominent bright red breasts and a white patch above the bill (frontal patch). Females, on the other hand, are brown with a rusty reddish-orange breast and white underparts.
 Females sit on the eggs to incubate them. Males, on the other hand, provide their mates with food.This arrangement ensures the eggs stay warm and safe until they are ready to hatch.
 Female scarlet robins build the actual nests with moss, spider webbing, and animal fibers. Males declare a nesting ground off-limits to other birds by vocalizing from a nearby lookout branch.

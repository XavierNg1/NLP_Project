 While catch and release is undoubtedly the most humane way to rid your home of mice and rats, they will likely try to re-enter your house. If they do not succeed, they will likely die outside.If you do release a rodent outside, release mice and rats at least a mile from your home.Squirrels should be released at least 4-5 miles from your home., Use live traps for squirrels. The most common type of live trap is a small cage-like structure with some type of trap door. The company Havahart makes several sizes and models of this type of structure.These are widely considered to be the most effective for trapping squirrels, and can work for rats as well.For mice, choose a trap that can hold multiple mice with a rotating trap door. Victor makes several different models that are smaller and designed to catch multiple mice in this way.Since they can catch multiple mice (sometimes as many as a dozen!) without being emptied, they also require less maintenance., An especially cheap trap option involves using a cardboard tube (such as those used to hold paper towel). Try this if you find evidence of mice on your counters. To try it, flatten one side of the tube so you have a half-circle shaped tunnel. To set your homemade trap:


Place the tube so that one end hangs off the edge of the counter.
Place a bucket or garbage can beneath the end of the tube.
Place a treat at the end of the tube that hangs off the edge of the counter. This will lure mice into the tube. The apparatus – and the mouse – will fall into the receptacle you set up below when the mouse reaches the treat., Though glue traps may seem humane since they don’t immediately kill rodents, they are actually the least humane type of trap. Rodents will chew their limbs off when stuck in glue traps, or die slowly.

 Do not make the space between points too big.
 Lines have to be connected in special pattern. First you connect all of the dots with lines without intersecting them, thus creating rectangular shapes. In your "weird rectangles", connect two points to create a triangle. Do not connect other lines (if you do, instead of triangle you will have an "X"). Do this until your image looks like a 3D structure and is filled with triangles.
 You can choose any color you want. Determine where the sun is in your drawing. Now, shade the image in with different colors. Now, your structure actually looks 3D. Although, most of the times you can't tell what it is...

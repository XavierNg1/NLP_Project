 A coworker is generally considered to be acting hostile when he or she engages in harassment (verbal or sexual), mocking of others, and/or bullying, typically with recurring frequency.Hostility can be intimidating or demoralizing and can make it difficult for others to feel safe in the workplace.;
, Hostility is often a defensive mechanism, employed by someone who feels insecure or jealous, or by someone who rejects others because of some perceived slight. Other times, a person is hostile because of abuse or neglect in his own life. Regardless of your coworker's motivation, understand that below the surface, the problem has nothing to do with you., Often times, effective communication can diffuse a situation, if it is managed early on. Speak calmly and tell your coworker what specific actions or behaviors are problematic, and why. Do not return hostility; rather, let your coworker know how you would like to be treated in a clear, calm manner.Speak with your hostile coworker in private. Hostile people may feel threatened if they are confronted in front of a group of peers.

Do not approach your coworker or try to speak with him about his behavior if you feel threatened. In these cases it may be best to simply speak with a manager or supervisor. Your supervisor should be able to diffuse the situation, and may even refer your coworker to a class, like anger management, that can help him work on his issues.

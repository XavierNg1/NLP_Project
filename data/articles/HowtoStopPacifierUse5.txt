, It will now not work when they suck on it any more. This causes the child to think it is "broken," and they will not like it any more.

This method works for hollow pacifiers.
A similar method for solid pacifiers is to get a razor knife and shave a tiny amount off the tip each day when they are asleep so it gets shorter and shorter.

This is a common method here. Some children immediately reject the 'broken' pacifier where others continue to use it until there is almost nothing left. Since the change is gradual you can tell them that it is "wearing out".


Wait for them to determine that it is broken and they will throw it away themselves.

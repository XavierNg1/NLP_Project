 Stay highly involved with your child's therapist(s), and make sure to include your child in conversations when appropriate. It is very important to remember that your child processes information differently, so you can not expect them to communicate exactly like others do. Don't let this become a reason to isolate them; rather, involve and encourage them.
 Teach your child other ways of positive social interaction through example. Teach them about the importance of eye contact, while being very patient and sensitive.


Try explaining a skill in words or pictures, or even using books.
Find ways to work around difficult skills. For example, many autistic people are unable to listen and speak well when forced to make eye contact. An autistic child could instead look at someone's chin, or their eyebrows, so that the other person can tell they are paying attention, but the child doesn't have to stare into their eyes.
 Making sure that other adults who frequently interact with your child understand the situation is a great way to foster your child's development. Get involved at your child's school, because it's important to keep communication practices consistent.

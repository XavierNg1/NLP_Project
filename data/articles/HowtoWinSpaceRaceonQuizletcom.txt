 Before you even try to play Space Race, you need to have some basic understanding of the vocabulary.;
, Now that you have some basic understanding, go to speller. It may seem backwards to do Speller before Learn, but the only difference is that Speller says the answer and focuses on just spelling, whereas Learn focuses on both spelling and the right answer. Now you have a better understanding of the terms and how to spell them.
 Now that you can spell and know the terms, try Learn. Once you have completed learn and know the terms like the back of your hand, continue on to part ||.
 Even if you know the terms perfectly, if you can't type, it doesn't matter.
 It's there by default. If it's not there and you have siblings who use the game too, they may have changed it.
 This will help you determine the answer faster. For instance, if you're confused between "consul" and "Julius Caesar" you can remember that "consul" was a two line definition, while "Julius Caesar" had a ten line definition.
 Even if you're an excellent typist, you can't afford to make mistakes. Don't take any chances and look at the keys!

, Don't wait until the end, because then you can't type in the answers to other questions.
 You're on your way to victory!

, This will help you choose you answer more quickly, therefore giving you more time to type.
 Then when it comes up, press Cmd or Ctr (the shortcut for paste.) Then, you don't waste your time fretting over how to spell the word quickly.
 When you answer it, the other one will be over the edge, so copy the answer using the above method and after typing in the previous answer, paste. This also works for those times when the definitions stack on top of each other. Simply answer, pause, copy, play, then paste!

, Though some may call this cheating, as long as you re-learn the terms, you're learning still and not cheating.

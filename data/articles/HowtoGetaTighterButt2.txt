 Opt to climb the stairs whenever possible (e.g. in lieu of taking an elevator at work every morning) to add butt-toning exercise to your day. For added benefit, try taking two stairs at a time. Try using a stair climber machine at the gym, which is a good way to get a full stair-climbing workout., Aerobics classes are a great way to maintain a regular exercise schedule and stay motivated about your workout. While any exercise classes will work towards tightening your butt in the long run, some have more immediate benefits. Spin classes, for example, offer an intensive workout focused on the lower body.You can also look for classes specifically geared towards butt workouts (e.g. “Booty Kickin’ Step” at Crunch gym in New York City).
 Hiking is an excellent workout — just one hour of moderately strenuous to vigorous hiking burns over 400 calories, toning your legs and butt in the process. When weather permits, look online for hiking trails near you, preferably on hilly terrain for an added challenge to your workout; plot out your route carefully, and be sure to bring a friend with you for safety. Wear sturdy shoes with thick, rubber soles to prevent falls and protect your feet.Bring water, snacks, your cell phone, a first-aid kit, a map, and a light jacket or umbrella in case of rain.

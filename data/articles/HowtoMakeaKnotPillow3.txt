 Measure your pillow first, then add 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) to each side. This will create a nice, snug pillowcase. You can use matching pieces of fleece, or contrasting ones. You can even use a solid color for one piece, and a pattern for the other., Make sure that the right sides are facing out. You will not be turning this pillowcase inside-out., Mark the squares out using a pen and ruler first, then cut them out using a sharp pair of fabric scissors. Try to cut through both layers of fleece at the same time so that the square match up., Lay down a strip of masking tape along the bottom of your fleece, 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) away from the edge. Cut 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide slits along the edge of the fleece, all the way up to the tape. Remove the tape when you are done, then repeat for the remaining three sides.Again, try to cut through both layers at the same time. This ensures that they match up.
 Take the first strip from both the top and bottom pieces of fleece. Holding them together, wrap them to form a loop, then push the ends through the loop. Slide the knot towards the top.You can also make a simple double-knot instead.
 Do not knot the strips along the top edge of the pillowcase just yet., The fit will be a little snug, but the fleece should stretch over the pillow. It will be very "puffy.", This will close the pillow, and hold everything together. Your knotted pillow is now complete!

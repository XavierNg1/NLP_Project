 Some older advice may still be in your mind when you set out to defragment; this list shows what you don't need to be concerned about:


It used to be recommended to open Windows in "Safe Mode". This is not necessary now.
It's not necessary to remove programs you don't use or need. However, as a general housekeeping rule, it's always a good idea to discard what you don't use.
You don't need to close all unnecessary programs or cancel any programs scheduled to run.
You don't need to delete any temporary files.
 Easy!

 Look for a solution, or for a way to take control of your circumstances. You may find that you feel trapped by the permanence of the past. If you take action in some way, you might empower yourself to move forward. Escape the chains of the past, and find your purpose in motion. Dive back in, and do not be afraid.


You cannot fix everything. Irreversible things happen, and you can only act upon the new reality that exists in the wake of the event. Think about how you might ease the suffering of others, or make amends, or keep what happened once from happening again.
 Once you acknowledge and accept the past, you can begin to take valuable lessons from it. Study the past, and use it to guide you into the future. Be careful not to internalize bad habits and anxieties â€“ only practical lessons. You may not be able to undo what happened, but you might be able to keep it from happening again.
 Evaluate your goals, and throw yourself into something new. Change the static energy of grief into the kinetic energy of action. Give something new the space it needs to bloom.

If you are trying to get over a relationship, consider whether you are ready for another relationship. If you lost a friend. think about ways to connect more deeply with other friends. If you regret something that you did or didn't do: look for a situation that gives you the opportunity to make the choice you wish you'd made.
You won't really get over the past until you stop thinking about it so much. Throwing your energy into something new can be a great way to stop thinking about the past. Change your focus. Reengage with your life.

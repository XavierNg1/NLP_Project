 In the formula, r = the length of the radius, and l = the length of the arc.

Remember the formula for finding the circumference (perimeter) of a circle is 2ùùÖr. If you know the length of the arc (which is a portion of the circumference), you can find what fraction of the circle the sector represents by comparing the arc length to the total circumference.

The complete formula would be A=(l2œÄr)œÄr2{\displaystyle A=\left({\frac {l}{2\pi r}}\right)\pi r^{2}}, but you can simplify it to A=rl2{\displaystyle A={\frac {rl}{2}}}., You will be multiplying these two numbers to get a new numerator.

For example, if the arc length is 5 cm and the radius is 8 cm, your new numerator will be 40.
 You are dividing the numerator found in step two. This gives you the area of the sector.

For example, 402=20{\displaystyle {\frac {40}{2}}=20}.

Since you are finding the area, your answer will be in square centimeters.

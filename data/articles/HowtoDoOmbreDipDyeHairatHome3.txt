 When you think it's light enough, open the foil and go higher up. If you think it is not light enough, wait for another minute or two. If you think it is light enough, open all the foils and section the hair to its original section.
 Put some bleach higher up, probably around 2.5 inches (6.4Â cm), and make sure to be a little messy and not leave a harsh line. Repeat the process from the first bleaching process and leave the bleach on the tips so they continue to lighten.
 Again, leave the bleach to process for about 15 minutes and check it regularly. Everyone's hair is different, so keep checking every couple minutes until you get the desire color.

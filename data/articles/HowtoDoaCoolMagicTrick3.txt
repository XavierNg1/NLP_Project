 Take a spare dollar from your wallet and fold it accordion style into thirds. Accordion style fold means to fold one part and then fold another part on top of that fold. Do not fold each part in the same direction. Switch directions of the fold each fold.Imagine or research how an accordion opens and closes. This is where the term, accordion fold, gets its name.
 Place the first paper clip on top of the folded bill with the shorter end facing you. This paper clip will go over the outer layer of the folded bill (facing you), and into the middle of the folded bill. Position the first paper clip so it is near the right edge of the bill.
 Attach the second paper clip to the back of the folded bill with shorter side facing away from you. The large section of the second paper clip should be through the middle part of the bill. Position the second clip to the left edge of the bill.


Position the second paper clip in the opposite position as the first one.
 Take one end of the bill in each hand. In one smooth motion, snap your hands apart, unraveling the dollar bill. In this motion the paper clips will fly into the air. Once the paper clips land, they will be attached.If the paper clips aren't attached, reconnect the clips and see if you initially set up the paper clips in the correct order.
 You should practice setting up this trick quickly before showcasing it to the public. Have the dollar bill already folded up in your pocket to make it appear as though it is a normal crinkled dollar. Show your audience the two separated paper clips and then quickly attach them to the dollar bill.


Say a magic phrase like “presto” or “alakazam” and then snap the dollar bill.
If everything was set up properly, you should pick up the connected paper clips to your audience.

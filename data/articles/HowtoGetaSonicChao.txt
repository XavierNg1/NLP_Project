 Try to use a regular Chao, not a color one or else the Chao will look like Sonic but not in the right color.;
, Have both of them spend equal time with the Chao.
, It's recommended to use animals because they give your Chao more points. Also, stamina does not matter! Even though many recommend raising your Chao's stamina level to 15-16 it doesn't have to. It can evolve at any level. However, raising the stamina level to 15 makes it evolve right away, but force feeding it takes a long time unless the Chao's personality is "Big Eater". Otherwise, continue to care for it with both Sonic and Shadow/ any hero or dark character.



If you used animals, remove the animal parts from your Chao by using skeleton dogs (which can be found at Pumpkin Hill on Church Mountain).
 After the animal parts have been removed, your Chao will eventually evolve into a neutral run type Chao. It should have a green ball over its head, green wings, three quills on its head, and its body will be green (unless you used a monotone colored Chao from the Black Market). This is a basic Sonic Chao. To see if your Chao is a run type, take it to the Chao doctor and see its medical chart.
 To make an advanced Sonic Chao that looks a lot more like Sonic, the Chao has to be three Chao years old. A Chao year is about three to four hours in real life spent in the Chao garden.
 Raise its run stats and enter it in a race to test its speed. Enjoy!

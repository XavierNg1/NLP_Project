 You will need to go to the art supply or craft store to gather supplies. Pick up glitter, masks, pipe cleaners, pom-poms, feathers, washable markers and peel and stick felt and glue.

Make sure everything you choose is in bright colors, or in the child's favorite colors.
 Make a document online that includes pictures of popular monsters, such as cookie monster, the Gruffalo, the monsters from "Where the Wild Things Are" and more. Write "Kelsey's Make your own Monster Kit" on the top., Include a monster-themed book, such as The Gruffalo, for an extra gift.

You can also design a similar craft kit according to the child's favorite book. They can make their own crown if they like a princess book, or make their own animal if they like a farmyard book.

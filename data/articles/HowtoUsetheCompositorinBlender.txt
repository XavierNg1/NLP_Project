You may notice something in the rendered image. Look at the nodes. Your image passed through the Render Layers node, through node(s) and into the Composite node.
Andrew Price from Blender Guru () Describes compositing as a food factory. The rendered image will come from the render layers node, get processed in nodes and come out at the Composite node. Things can get added to the food, things can get taken out, or changed.
The other circles one the nodes that say, for example, alpha or size, are self-explanatory. They dynamically control settings.
 Some of them, like Blur will be easy to use, others, like Glare will be hard to use. Just keep experimenting.
 Your editor will start getting crowded.

 Many hotels offer the option of swapping your pillow if yours is too hard, too soft, or too lumpy. Contact your hotel’s sleep concierge or housekeeping department in order to get a pillow that suits your sleeping style., Turn off your computer and TV at least an hour before you go to sleep. Set your phone alarm and set it aside for the night. This will prevent you from looking at the screen, which can make it harder for you to go to bed. You could also read a book in bed to help you relax., Use a sleep mask and earplugs to avoid being disrupted by goings-on either outside or in the next room over. Your earplugs should block sound 60 decibels and above. Your eye mask should completely block out light and sit comfortably on your face.These are especially important if you’re sharing the room with someone who snores or has a different bedtime than you.
Instead of earplugs, you could invest in a white noise machine.A white noise machine is a small device that drowns out the sound of external noises by producing a steady and pleasing low-volume sound of its own.

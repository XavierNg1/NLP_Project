 Baptisms call for a fancier attire than what you might wear everyday. You should invest in a pretty dress, skirt, or pantsuit, or wear one that you already own. As a guide for how classy your outfit should be--you should be more dressed up than if you were at a backyard barbecue, but less dressed up than if you were attending a wedding.Some outfit ideas include:


A dress with an optional wrap or light sweater.
A skirt and blouse that is not too revealing.
Tailored pants with a smart top (think business casual).;
, Unlike weddings, baptisms don’t have any rules about what colors you can and can’t wear (its pretty unlikely that you’ll match the baby, unless you show up in white from head to foot). Because this is a happy occasion, feel free to wear bright colors and interesting patterns., While there might not be restrictions on color choice, there are restrictions on what cuts of clothing you can wear. Avoid showing off your bare shoulders and definitely avoid low-cut necklines. If you pick out a dress or skirt, make sure that it reaches down below your knees--miniskirts are frowned upon.Other clothes that you should avoid include: jeans, flip flops, Uggs, sneakers, or anything that you might see at a nightclub.
 Churches can get pretty chilly, especially during colder months. You can kill two birds with one stone when you wear a sweater or jacket--it will make your outfit seem more demure, and it will keep you warm.
 Sky-high heels are generally not appropriate for a baptism. Instead, wear lower heels that you can walk and stand comfortably in. Wear shoes appropriate for the weather--if its snowing outside you might want to leave your open-toed slingbacks at home.

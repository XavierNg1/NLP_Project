 The formula is slope=riserun{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}\;={\frac {\text{rise}}{\text{run}}}}. The rise is the vertical distance between two points on a line. The run is the horizontal distance between two points on a line.
 You can use two given points, or you can select any two points. It doesnâ€™t matter how far apart or close together the two points are, but keep in mind that if the points are closer together, there will be less need to simplify the slope later.

For example, you might choose the points (4, 4) and (12, 8).
 Start at one point, and count up in a straight line, until you reach the height of the second point. This is the rise of your slope.

Your rise will be negative if you start with the higher point and move down to the lower point.

For example, beginning at the point (4, 4), you would count up 4 positions to point (12, 8). So, the rise of your slope is 4: slope=4run{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}\;={\frac {4}{\text{run}}}}.
 Start at the same point you started at when calculating the run. Count across in a straight line, until you reach the length of the second point. This is the run of your slope.

Your run will be negative if you start with the point on the right and move over to the left.

For example, beginning at the point (4, 4), you would count over 8 positions to point (12, 8). So, the run of your slope is 8: slope=48{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}\;={\frac {4}{8}}}.
 You would simplify the slope just as you would  simplify any fraction. For example, 4 and 8 are both divisible by 4, so the slope 48{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{8}}} simplifies to 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}. Note that it is a positive slope, so the line moves up to the right.

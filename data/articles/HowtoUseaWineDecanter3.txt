 Red wines that have aged in the bottle for longer than about 8 years will typically begin forming sediment. This sediment is created when the wine's tannins begin breaking down and precipitating out of the wine. Minimally filtered wines may also have sediment consisting of dead yeast cells and grape residue.


Decanting an aged wine can help remove this sediment, which tastes unpleasantly bitter. If possible, allow the bottle of wine to stand upright for a day before serving so that the sediment settles to the bottom of the bottle.
 When pouring an aged wine, pour it is slowly and carefully as possible into the decanter. Keep a keen eye on the wine bottle's opening to check for any sediment. As soon as you see sediment starting to enter the stream of wine, stop pouring the wine and allow the remaining portion to remain in the bottle.


Holding a candle or flashlight underneath the wine bottle will help you to see the sediment approaching the neck of the bottle.
 The question of whether or not aged wines benefit from an aeration period in the decanter can be a controversial one. Generally, aged wines will not need their tannins softened as much as younger wines, and therefore can be poured sooner from the decanter into drinking glasses.

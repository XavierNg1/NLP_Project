 Readers are more likely to click on affiliate links within articles that contain information that can benefit them; as opposed to links within promotional emails written specifically for the sake of advertising.
 For example, if you are marketing video games or video game systems, you can write an article about the best sporting games available on the market. You can then place affiliate links for each video game within each summary that describes each game.
 Your customers may be actual clients, or they can be friends, family, or members of an online community you belong to. For example, if you have a brick-and-mortar used video game business, you can encourage your customers to provide you with their email addresses so you can send them emails.

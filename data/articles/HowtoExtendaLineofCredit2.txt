 If you have received a raise or a higher paying job, you might be able to increase your limit. You will have to show the bank evidence of your increased income. Let them know that you want to extend your line of credit based on your higher income. Some types of evidence include:Your offer from a new job stating your salary
Two recent paystubs from within 90 days
A letter from your employer stating your increased income

, Staying on top of payments and deadlines will make you seem more responsible to the credit company. Not only will this improve your credit score but it will make you more attractive to your lender. You can even set up automatic payments through your bank to make sure that you pay on time.Do not charge things on your credit that you cannot afford to pay off at the end of the month This will lower your score, decreasing your chances of a credit line extension.
 Your credit utilization ratio is the percentage of your credit limit that you use at any time. For example, if you keep $250 on a line of credit with a $1000 limit, you have a utilization ratio of 25%. Keeping your ratio below 30% can improve your credit score. It also looks impressive to the bank., In the process of offering you a higher limit, your bank or credit company will likely do a hard credit enquiry on your credit score. This will temporarily lower your score. If you ask for credit increases too often or if you do so after opening up a credit card, you will find your credit score decreasing.When you contact the company, you should ask them at the beginning if they are going to do a hard credit check.
If your credit company offers you a small increase without checking your credit, take advantage of their offer. This means that they are offering you an increase without affecting your credit score.

 The quickest way to change an MOV file to MP4 is to simply change the extension. MP4 is a subset of the MOV format, so no conversion is actually necessary.This will work on any operating system, and doesn't require any additional software. This is especially useful because QuickTime 7 Pro is no longer available for sale, and this method is free.;
, Windows may be hiding the extensions of your files. The extensions will need to be visible in order to change them.


Windows 10 and 8 - Click the "View" tab at the top your Explorer window and check the "File name extensions" box.
Windows 7 and earlier - Open the Control Panel and select "Folder Options." Click the "View" tab and uncheck "Hide extensions for known file types."

, This will allow you to change the name of the file, as well as the extension.
 When you press ↵ Enter or ⏎ Return, you'll be prompted to confirm that you want to change the extension.
 Your operating system will warn you that changing the file name can make the file unreadable. You can ignore this warning and proceed.


In macOS, click "Use .mp4" in the window that appears.
In Windows, click "Yes" in the window that appears.
 Double-click the renamed file to confirm that loads in your media player. The file is now in MP4 format, and will work with any player or device that supports it.


You can always change the extension back to .mov to revert it to its original form.
This will work for 99% of MOV files you come across. If this doesn't work, see one of the following methods.

 Combine 16.5 ounces (467.76 grams) of lemon cake mix, lemon zest, 1 tablespoon (29.5 mL) of lemon juice, and melted butter in a large bowl and mix everything together until it reaches a smooth texture. Use a spoon or your hands to work out lumps that the cake mix creates.You can purchase lemon cake mix at most major grocery stores.
As an alternative, you can grind up lemon cookies in a food processor to replace your lemon cake mix.;
, Continue to knead the dough until it thickens up enough so that you can roll it out into truffle balls. Once it hardens enough, you should be able to roll out 2-inch (5.08 cm) balls with your hands. If your dough is crumbly and not holding together, add a teaspoon (4.9 mL) of butter until it holds.
 Use the palm of your hand to softly roll each of your truffles in a separate bowl of granulated sugar. Continue to roll them until the entire surface of your truffles are covered in sugar. Set them on a cookie sheet when you're done rolling them., Setting the truffles in the refrigerator will help them set and will make them harder. Allow the dessert to warm up to room temperature before eating them.

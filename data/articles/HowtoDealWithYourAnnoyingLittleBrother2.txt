 The best way to resolve any fight is through open communication.


Find somewhere quiet and invite your brother to talk about the situation with you.
Enter the conversation with a positive attitude. If you are defensive or upset he will sense it in you.
 If you are feeling frustrated by his behavior, tell him. Your brother may not understand the consequences of his actions. Be honest about your emotions


One good way to share your feelings is through the "I-Message" method. . Create a sentence using: "I feel_____________when you___________because___________." This will prevent your little brother from feeling attacked.
 It may feel from your perspective that you have done nothing wrong. But younger children are often sensitive and feel powerless. Let your brother know that you are on his side and are trying to fix the problem by apologizing.


Sometimes it is necessary to let go of your pride in order to solve a conflict, especially with someone younger than you.
 Young children often feel their feelings are unheard in a family. Show him that you care about him and understand him by being a good listener.

 Sneakers conform to your toddler’s feet because they are made of canvas and flexible leather.


They are soft on the feet and can also be used for casual wear.
Most importantly, they allow for proper muscle development while protecting your feet.
 During winter, ankle boots are perfect because they also allow natural flexing of the foot joints.


Wellies are also good during the rainy weather because they are made of waterproof materials.
However, boots should not be worn every day because your toddler’s feet are still growing and boots can be too restrictive., Sandals don’t offer any protection at all and your toddler might hurt their toes or part of their foot when they are playing outside.


Additionally, opt for closed-toed sandals because they provide better protection compared to open-toed ones.
 Flat shoes that let your child’s feet bear down normally on the ground are better at this stage for proper support and stability.


Heels are best left to children who are older and have more developed, stronger feet.

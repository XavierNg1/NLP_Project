 If there are children from the previous marriage, you should treat them with love and respect. However, don't try to act like the biological parent. They will develop a relationship with you if given time and space. Let the children set the pace.Remember that the children may be loyal to the ex and feel betrayed at the new marriage at first. Donâ€™t force the children to choose, and let them work through the feelings.
Continue being accepting, kind, and thoughtful, even if their behavior toward you is somewhat otherwise.
 If everyone involved wants to try to get along, make an effort to be cooperative. Realize that your spouse's former partner is a human being. If they are making an effort to treat you with respect, you should do the same., You should understand that when you share your life with your spouse, you accept all of their baggage as well. Try to think of the child support as a bill that one of you acquired, but both of you accept and pay together, like a credit card.If you think that the ex is greedy or getting more than they deserve, be very careful about how you broach the subject with your spouse. It may be better to speak indirectly about the costs and let your spouse reach their own conclusions.
 If you can't stop obsessing about your spouse's ex, it's time to speak to someone who can counsel you about your obsessive thoughts.You may want to go to counseling alone, or you may want to go with your spouse so you can work through the issues related to the ex.

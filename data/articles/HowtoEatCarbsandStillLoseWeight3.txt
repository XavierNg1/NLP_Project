 Portion control is key when eating carbs and losing weight. If you consume too much, you will not meet your weight-loss goals, and may even gain weight. Adhere to your portion needs at every meal.Use nutrition labels to determine how many grams of carbs within a given food.
If you’re consuming a whole food without a nutrition label, search online for the food’s average carbohydrate value.
Generally, your per-meal carbohydrate needs will equal one small baked potato, one banana, or one 125-gram can of cannellini beans.One slice of whole wheat bread, ¾ cup of cereal, 1/3 cup of cooked legumes, and ½ cup of corn contain about 15 grams of carbohydrates and 80 calories each.Veggies contain carbs at lower levels than starchier foods, but can still be a valuable source of carbs. For instance, ½ cup of vegetable juice, one cup of raw veggies, and ½ cup of cooked veggies each contain about 25 calories and 5 grams of carbohydrates.
About half of your daily calories should come from carbs. In a normal diet, that means that about 800-1,000 of their calories should be in the form of carbohydrates.
 Your diet should not be so restrictive that you never allow yourself any of life’s pleasures. For instance, if you wish to snack on a bit of chocolate, drink some wine, or have an appetizer of cheese and crackers with friends, go for it. Don’t overindulge, but help yourself to small helpings of what you love on a daily or weekly basis.If you continue to deprive yourself, your urge to consume the desired foodstuff will build up, leading to unhealthy binging.
 If you have a variety of carbs to consume, you will not get bored of eating carbs while losing weight. This will keep you from eating too much fatty foods, or from eating the wrong sorts of carbs. Fortify your pantry by obtaining a variety of fruits, veggies, legumes, and grains. Be adventurous and try something you might normally skip, like dumplings or honeydew melon.

 Toss a handful of ice cubes in a Hurricane glass - the more ice, the colder the drink. If you don't have a Hurricane glass, any sort of cocktail glass will work. Old Fashioned glasses look particularly great.
 Add the liquid ingredients in sequence, pouring them over the ice. Gently mix the ingredients to combine. Alternatively, add the ice and and liquid ingredients to a cocktail shaker, shake to combine, and pour into the glass. Again, there are countless variations on the ingredients in a Rum Runner - the recipes at the top of this article represent just a few possibilities. As a reminder, the recipes in this article are:

, Garnish with orange or lemon slice and serve with a straw.
 Like with the frozen version of the Rum Runner, it's not uncommon to add a Bacardi floater to the Rum Runner on the rocks. Do so in the same way - pour 1 oz (30 mL) of Bacardi 151 over the top of the completed drink.


Note that because the "on the rocks" version of the Rum Runner is liquid, rather than slushy, the Bacardi 151 will mix with the cocktail itself somewhat. If you don't want this, try pouring the Bacardi into the straw - this ensures that the first thing you taste is the Bacardi by itself and ensures that the Bacardi doesn't mix with the rest of the drink.

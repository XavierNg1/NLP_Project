 Usually, this will be the most natural to you, and it will not feel as hard to stay still.
 It is recommended to tuck your face under your arms or in your chest. That way, if someone comes by, they will not be able to see your mouth or nose.
 You will be less likely to panic if you do not know that someone is watching you. Take deep breaths and relax while playing.
 Make sure the person playing it is not near you, and cannot see you very well. If you are unable to turn your head to check, take breaks when you hear the "it" person's voice somewhere within ten feet of you.


It does not matter if another player sees you, whether they are still in or out. The one that is "it" is the only person with the power to eliminate other players.
 If you are out of everyone's view, then there is less chance the person that is it will come looking for you. Corners, under desks, and behind stuff are good places to hide. Avoid places where a lot of people are because "it" will most likely be there until he/she has gotten a good number of players out.

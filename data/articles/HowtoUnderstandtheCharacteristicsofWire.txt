 Hardness refers to the ease with which the wire can be shaped, scored, indented, or pitted. Hardness impacts the final look or sheen of a wire project and can impact on how well the project presents. If you are using copper or aluminium, you are working with soft metals, whereas iron is hard.;
, Ductility refers to the ability of a metal to be turned into a wire width. Finer wires are made from the most ductile metals, and less ductile metals produce thicker wires. The order of ductility is (most to least):


Gold
Silver
Platinum
Iron
Copper
Aluminium
Zinc
Tin
Lead

, Malleability refers to the ability of the metal to be flattened without breaking or splitting. This is often a very important aspect of wire work! If you are not sure, always practise on a test piece first and hammer it flat to see what happens. The order of malleability is as follows (most malleable to least):


Gold (so malleable it can be made into foil and gold leaf for cakes)
Silver
Aluminium
Copper
Tin
Platinum
Lead
Zinc
Iron

, Rigidity is the opposite of malleability. It will be important in some projects that your wire does not have any give so that the shape of the project is maintained for a long duration.
 Tensile strength refers to how much stress a wire can take when stretched at either end. This can be important for stretched jewellery projects, or for sculptures that require balancing or holding up of some elements. Copper has an excellent tensile strength.
 When purchasing your wire, it can come in a variety of possible shapes, such as round, half-round, square, and flat. Also, you will need to familiarise yourself with the differing gauges of wire available. The thinness and thickness of the wire you choose will be dependent on the projects you are making. Visit a store and check them out, feel them and see what works for you. It can help to purchase a range of samples to play around with in your workshop to see what works best for your creativity.

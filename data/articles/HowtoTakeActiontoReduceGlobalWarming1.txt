 Since animal meat and animal products take a lot of energy, water, and other resources to create and transport, you can lower your carbon footprint by reducing your consumption of them. Instead of eating animal products, consider adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet. To do so, refocus your diet on fresh fruit and vegetables., By minimizing the amount of products you consume that are made far from you, you’ll not only help your local economy, but reduce your overall carbon footprint. Look around your community for products made locally.Visit farmers markets for locally-grown produce and other food.
Buy products, like furniture, from local craftsmen.
 Since it requires a lot of energy to create certain materials from scratch, recycling and reusing will lower the amount of energy needed to make new products. Use recycle bins provided by your local government. If you don’t have access to them, collect plastic, aluminum, and paper products and periodically bring them to a recycle center near you.Donate items you don't want instead of throwing them away.
Use cloth towels, reusable plates, and silverware instead of paper towels, paper plates, and disposable silverware.

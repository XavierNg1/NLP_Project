 One tank contains 2 kg of carbon monoxide gas at 77⁰ C and 0.7 bar. The other tank holds 8 kg of the same gas at 27⁰ C and 1.2 bar. The valve is opened and the gases are allowed to mix while receiving energy by heat transfer from the surroundings. The final equilibrium temperature is 42⁰ C. Using the ideal gas model, determine the final equilibrium pressure, in bar; the heat transfer for the process in kJ


Note It is easier to solve the problem by working with just variables, and then at the last step plug in the values. This same method will be followed here.;

 If you or your family members feed your puppy table scraps often, your puppy might be putting off eating in hopes of being fed table scraps. Feeding your puppy table scraps can also make it full, which can cause your puppy to skip its meals.Also, keep track of the amount of treats you feed your puppy. Too many treats can cause your puppy to be full and skip meals. Keep track of treats by placing a set amount in a jar. This way, you can see how many treats were given in a day or week.
 Sometimes the food bowl could be the cause. If your puppy’s food bowl is too big, moves, or makes noises while it eats, this might discourage your puppy from eating. Additionally, if you use a plastic bowl, the plastic smell of the bowl might taint the smell of the food. This will lower the palpability of your puppy’s food.Choose a stainless steel or ceramic bowl that does not slide as your puppy eats. Make sure to choose a bowl that is not too big, as well.
 If your puppy’s food bowls are placed in high-traffic areas, this could be a part of the reason why your puppy isn’t eating regularly. Instead, place your puppy’s bowls in a quiet corner in the kitchen or in the laundry room.Also, try feeding your puppy during quiet times of the day, like early in the morning or after dinner.

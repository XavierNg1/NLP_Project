 The types most often used in the home setting are drip, popup bubblers and popup sprayers. While each type will irrigate, each performs better in specific situations. You must decide whether one type or a combination will do the trick for you.


A drip irrigation system is exactly what it says and involves low water pressure and no aerial spray to achieve the goal of correctly watering your plants. It is made of perforated water hose or pipe laid on, or just below, the surface and runs to a controller. This system works best for flower or garden beds.
The bubbler irrigation system relies on moderate pressure that causes a popup head that, rather than spray, allows the water to "bubble" out and soak slowly into the ground. This arrangement is attached to small water lines that run from a controller, or valve, activated as needed. It is intended for deep watering. Bubblers are used for, and around, shrubbery or trees.
Popup sprayers pop up and deliver a pressurized aerial spray that uses a zone system to irrigate flower and garden beds as well as lawns. Popup sprayers are often the reason water runs off into streets and drainage systems. This is all due to over watering and their ability to put out more water than the ground can soak up.;

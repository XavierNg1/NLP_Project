 After the first time, shaving yourself is best done in the shower or bathtub. When you see yourself all shaved, you will freak out over how weird it looks! But you will see how much cleaner and smoother you feel!
, An older used blade can pull, and that's one area you can do without that!, Be sure and use a good shaving cream that helps to prevent "razor bumps" and redness.

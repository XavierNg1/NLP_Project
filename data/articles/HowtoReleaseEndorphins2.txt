 It's an everyday, immediate way to give yourself an endorphin rush. The act of laughing stimulates the production of endorphins and helps you feel good instantly. Laughter helps to relieve stress and has many other physical and emotional benefits. Laughing has so many therapeutic benefits that some people practice "laugh therapy" to schedule in some healthy laughter as often as possible.
Sharing a joke with friends or finding something genuinely funny is the best way to make the most of laughter. Go for a deep, belly laugh that takes over your whole body.
 True smiles, called Duchenne smiles, result in the production of endorphins, giving your mood a boost.A Duchenne smile is one that engages your entire face, including your eyes. It's almost impossible to fake, and it only happens when you're really feeling happy.


A smile that engages just your mouth, and not your eyes, doesn't have the same beneficial effects.
To boost your mood with a smile, try looking at pictures that make you smile, or talk to a person who makes you happy.

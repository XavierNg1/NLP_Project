 Traditionally, the tortilla is deep-fried in vegetable oil. This is considered the most authentic, and often tastiest way to prepare tostada shells, though if you are watching your calories you may wish to bake or microwave the tortilla.;
,, Test the heat by dropping a small piece of tortilla into the center of the skillet. If the tortilla immediately sizzles and fries, the oil is ready.
 The outer edges of the tortilla should bubble, as should the center. Always be careful of splattering oil.
 Depending on your stove this may take 8 to 10 or up to 30 seconds for each side. A fully fried tostada should be a light to medium brown color.
 Let the shells cool on a plate covered in an absorbent paper towel.

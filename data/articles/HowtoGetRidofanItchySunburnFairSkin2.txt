 Hydrocortisone is an over the counter steroid cream that is often very successful at reducing inflammation, redness, and itching. It stops your cells from releasing inflammatory substances, which calms the skin.Apply hydrocortisone to your sunburn 4 times daily, rubbing it into your skin.Use hydrocortisone very sparingly on your face and for no more than 4 or 5 days., Sometimes the itchiness in a sunburn is caused by immune-system cells that release histamines to notify your brain that something is wrong.An antihistamine can suppress this reaction and temporarily relieve itching and swelling.Take a non-drowsy antihistamine (such as loratadine) during the day.Follow the directions on the box for dosage and use.
At night you can take a diphenhydramine, which can cause extreme drowsiness. Don’t try to drive, operate machinery, or do anything that might endanger yourself or others when taking this antihistamine. Just go to sleep!If the itching is severe, talk to your doctor about hydroxyzine. It is a prescription drug that sedates your central nervous system and also acts as an antihistamine.
 Available as sprays, creams, and ointments, a local anesthetic blocks nerve signals in your body so you won’t feel the itching sensation.To use the aerosol spray, shake the can well and hold it 4-6 inches from your skin. Spray it on the sunburn and rub in gently. Be very careful not to spray any into your eyes.For creams, gels, or ointments, apply the cream to dry skin and gently rub until it is evenly distributed. Look for brands that include aloe which can help soothe your skin.

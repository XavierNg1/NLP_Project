 Ohm's law is used because resistance cannot be measured in an operating circuit, so Ohm's law is useful when it needs to be calculated.


Voltage is represented by E in Ohm's law
Ampere is represented by I in Ohm's law
Ohm is represented by R in Ohm's law

, Ohm's law is using two electromagnetic variables to find the unknown one.

R = E/I
I = E/R
E = IR (I x R but in mathematical equations the multiplication sign can be confusing with the option of a variable x)

, Examples are important because they provide practice in both converting into Ohm's law and how to calculate it.

I = 6A and E = 24V. What is R (resistance/Ohm's)?

Voltage and current/amperes are known. R = E/I as expressed earlier in the article. E = voltage and I = current/amperes. R = E/I is R = 24/6 in this aspect. 24/6 = 4, so R (or Ohm's) is equal to 4 units.


R = 6立 and E = 12V. What is I (ampere/current)?

The resistance and voltage are known. The correct formula to find the answer would be I = E/R. So we then order the different units to solve. I = 12V/6立. 12/6 is 2, so I (ampere/current) = 2.


I = 5A and R = 8立 . What is E (voltage)?

The formula for finding E is E = IR. Rearrange the variables to fit the formula, as done with the other examples. E = 5A(8立). 5 multiplied by 8 equals 40, so the E (voltage) = 40.


Heat is produced by an electric current
Energy and gas relate to pressure, volume, and temperature. An important part of this is that Joule found that internal energy of an ideal gas does not change if pressure or volume is influenced, but does with temperature. This is important in later physics and science studies.


Q = I (to the power of 2) * R * T

,

Q = heat
I = ampere
R = resistance/Ohm's
T = time

,
Ohm's law may be needed before Joule's law. You need the same values as I and R that are in Ohm's law needed in Joule's law. This means that if I or R are missing, you need to perform Ohm's law first before performing Joule's law.
Joule's law has another value than Ohm's to determine heat: time. This is important because if you take a boiling pot of water away from a heat source, it will eventually cool.

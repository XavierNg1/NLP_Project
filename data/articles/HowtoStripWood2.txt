 Wipe the furniture with a clean cloth to remove dust and dirt.
 Use a paintbrush to spread the appropriate solvent onto the wood. Apply the solvent to 1 small section at a time. Use denatured alcohol for shellac. Use lacquer thinner for lacquer. Use a half-denatured alcohol, half-lacquer thinner mixture for finishes composed of lacquer and shellac.
, Use steel wool or a coarse cloth to swab the thinner or alcohol from the wood. Work briskly so that the solvent doesn't evaporate.
 Move in small sections over the entire portion you want to remove. Change cloths frequently to avoid rubbing the finish back into the furniture.
 Use a furniture scraper or steel wool soaked in the appropriate solvent to remove the paint. Remove the finish following the direction of the wood's grain.

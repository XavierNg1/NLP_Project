 Sometimes you can join a site but not really like it, try to avoid this, especially if you've put any personal info on. A stalker could get that and use it against you, without you knowing it.


If it's possible, search and see what people say about the website you're thinking of joining. If they give them good rates, or if people say it's dangerous, it'll vary, but always look at the comments and see any warnings.
 If you like the website, make an account. They'll usually ask for the following:


Username
Password
E-mail address
Gender
First name
Last name
Zip/postal code
State
City

, This is fun, just fill out the basic info you want (Or feel comfortable to give) and save it.
 Explore the site and see how things work, if it's a chat room, hang out in it and see what people talk about.


If you ever feel uncomfortable in a chat (If someone asks you info you don't wan to give away), you don't have to answer. Just say "I value my privacy" and if they keep pushing, leave the chat.

Call Graco directly at 1-800-345-4109 for assistance with locating the ID label on your Graco item, or use the "Locate Product Information" tool provided on Graco's website; the link of which is provided in the Sources section of this article.
In some cases, the model number, serial number, and manufacture date may either be located on the manual's cover or printed on the inside of the manual.;

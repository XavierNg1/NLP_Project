 Do one shelf, or the floor of the closet at a time. Closets can be intimidating, so you might tackle one area at a time, and do it every day for a week. Each day should only take 15 minutes or so, if you work quickly and make quick decisions about each item.;
, Everything. Do the same with the floor of the closet — in fact, remove everything from the floor and keep the floor clear if at all possible. A clear floor greatly simplifies a closet.
 Clear all junk and debris, then clean with a wet rag or use a cleaning product. Make it nice and clean.
 And toss it.
 Sort:

stuff you’d like to give away. Put this in a box to give away, and put the box in your car to drop off when you’re done;
stuff you want to put in other places in the house (do this immediately after you’re done); and
stuff you want to keep in the closet. Only put back what is essential. Get rid of the clothes that you no longer wear or like.
 You'll be able to enjoy things more and find them easily![[Image:Enjoy your simplified closets Step 6.jpg}}

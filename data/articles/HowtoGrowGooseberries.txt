Potted gooseberry plants will often be simpler to plant as they should already have small root systems established.Consult your local plant nursery for special gooseberry clippings, like strains that are disease resistant or strains that are known for larger yields.;
, If you are getting your clippings from a wild bush, or your clippings are unpotted, be sure your clippings are from a 2-3 year old bush with 3-5 main branches and a head of at least 4-6 inches. You will need to keep your bare-root clippings cool and moist if not planted immediately, and they will need to be soaked in water for about 4 hours before planting.Wrap the root in a moist paper towel, place the root in a cup or glass, and set in the fridge until you are ready to plant.

 Preparing your plot in advance of planting will include choosing a well ventilated site with adequate moisture and making sure your soil is loose to optimize growth. Take a shovel and loosen the soil to a depth equivalent to the height of the rootball, which is the mass of roots under the stem, and over a wide area to prevent compaction and improve drainage.If you have bare root clippings they will not have a root ball. Instead, loosen the soil around a depth of 3 inches.
If your plot becomes waterlogged over the winter, simply loosen the soil again and plant your clippings on a slight mound, approximately 3-4 inches high., Creating a nutrient rich plot is key during preparation as you will not be adding fertilizer during the planting period. Combine your existing soil with organic matter, like compost and fertilizer, during your initial plot preparation. If your original soil is sandy you many need to apply generous amounts of fertilizer.Consult your local plant nursery about your soil type and about acquiring organic matter for plot preparation.

Clippings should be spaced approximately 12-15 inches apart and replanted bushes approximately 4-5 feet apart., Scatter 2-4 inches of organic mulch in the form of wood chips, pine needles, or compost immediately after your clippings are planted. Mulch cools the soil, conserves water, and suppresses weeds, which is preferable in shaded plots and essential in sunny plots.If you do not have a compost at home you can purchase mulch at your local plant nursery.

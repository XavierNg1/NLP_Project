 Painful abdominal cramps are a common symptom of EPI, and can be a sign that your body is not properly producing digestive enzymes or properly absorbing nutrients. If you experience chronic abdominal pain, plan to schedule an appointment with your doctor and inquire about EPI.EPI is particularly associated with epigastric abdominal pain, which is pain in the upper abdomen between your sternum (breast bone) and navel. This pain may radiate to your back.
EPI is often difficult to diagnose, since its symptoms—including abdominal cramps—are shared by several other abdominal and digestive disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome, bowel inflammation, gallbladder diseases, and peptic ulcer disease.;
, Since EPI diminishes healthy digestive enzymes in your body and reduces your body’s ability to digest and absorb healthy fats and vitamins from food, it’s common for individuals with EPI to lose weight, sometimes at a rapid pace. As another side effect of inadequate digestion, individuals with EPI can experience frequent tiredness or fatigue.Inability to gain weight is a common symptom of EPI in children. Since children weigh relatively little to begin with, an inability to gain weight should be taken seriously when first noticed., Since EPI is a condition of the digestive system, it can have a significant on the frequency and consistency of stool. Nearly all individuals with EPI suffer from diarrhea, which in the case of EPI is known as “steatohhrea.” This stool characterized as greasy, bulky, pale, watery, and very foul-smelling.Steatohhrea is higher in fats than healthy stool, since EPI prevents the body from fully digesting all of the fats that would normally be absorbed into the bloodstream. This condition puts you at high risk for losing important fat-soluble vitamins, like vitamins A, D, E and K, and may result in vitamin deficiencies.The stool may contain oily droplets, and may float to the surface of the water in the toilet bowl, making it difficult to flush at times.

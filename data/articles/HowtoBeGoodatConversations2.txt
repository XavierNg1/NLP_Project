 At the start everyone settles into a comfortable distance from one another. Aim to stand or sit as close to them as they are to you.
 It is customary for each person to get the chance to introduce themselves. It can be a nod of the head or a simple Hello, and its nice to give your name if you wish. Standard phrases like ‘how are you?’ and ‘I’m fine, what about you?’ are often used to build up good feeling among the group. Experiment with phrases like this. Conversations follow a general pattern: the greeting, the body of the conversation and the farewell. The main body follows the greeting.


People now take it in turns to talk. Appreciate and support the conversation as it unfolds. Its perfectly all right, and actually valuable, to remain in the listener role for as long as you wish.
The farewell: After a while, the conversation will come to an end and people will say goodbye to each other.



Create a comfortable atmosphere of approachability. Do this with your posture, your position, your tone of voice and a friendly face.
Guide the bubble of atmosphere toward the people you wish to converse with.
Invite people into the conversation. Do this with an Opening Question. Make the opening question easy and comfortable to answer. Or, make an opening observation about some feature of the situation you both share.
Encourage and support the conversation. (Rather like being the host at a mini-party.)

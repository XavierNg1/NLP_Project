 Get comfortable with what lighting and angling can do to your look by posing in front of the mirror. Use this as time to find what works for you.Change up your lighting, as well as your pose. Compare daylight to an incandescent light, or midday to dusk.
Don’t focus on the poses you don’t like. Instead of spending time worrying about why a pose didn’t work for you, spend more time working with angles and positions you find flattering.
Make the experience fun for yourself by turning on music or posing with a friend.
 Try taking some pictures of yourself with your own phone or camera. Don’t worry about getting a great picture. Just try to get used being photographed and seeing photographs of yourself.


Remind yourself that no one else has to see your selfies. You can delete any of them that you do not like.
If you are using your phone’s camera, try different filters and effects to make your pictures more fun and less intimidating.
 You could use any number of things as a prop depending upon the situation. Simply try to find something that will help you feel occupied or comfortable on camera.


Try a photo booth or photo booth filter on a phone’s camera. Use hats, signs, and other props to take stress away from looking good for the camera.
Pack a pair of sunglasses, a scarf, or some other accessory if you are going out with shutterbug friends. Throw on the glasses or bundle into the scarf so that only part of your face is exposed. This lets you practice being in pictures without feeling too overwhelmed.

 A “barre” is when you use the same fingering across more than one string.In this intermediate version of the chord, start by placing your first finger on the fifth A string at the second fret.
Press it down it flat across to the first E string.
All five strings should now be pressed down at the second fret.
 Just as the previous method, put your second finger on the second B string at the third fret., This is different from the previous method in that you put your third finger on the fourth D string at the fourth fret. , You’re actually going to put your fourth pinky finger on the third G string at the fourth fret, right next to your third finger., For this intermediate version, you’re not going to play the sixth E string. Instead, start your pick or thumb on the fifth string and strum through to the first to play the chord. Do not include the sixth E string.

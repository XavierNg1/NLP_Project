 You need to place your whole chicken breast side down, with its legs towards you. Spatchcocking is an alternate method to flatten a whole chicken, making it simple for barbecuing a chicken or baking it in the oven quickly., The parson's nose is the fleshy bit that pokes out of the end of the chicken, between the legs facing you. Using your kitchen shears, cut down the chicken in two lines on either side. It's important to use sharp shears, because you will be cutting through rib bones as you do this. Go down either side of the parson's nose, until you reach the other side of the chicken. Remove the strip you've just cut., Now that you've removed that strip, you can open your chicken up. Lay it flat on your cutting board, and use the heel of your hand to press down. By doing this, you'll ensure the chicken cooks more evenly. There is no exact science to this â€“ simply press down firmly on all parts of the chicken until it's relatively the same thickness throughout., By poking skewers through your flattened chicken, you will help keep it flat throughout the cooking process. Use two skewers, threading them through breast and thigh meat. When you're finished, they should form an "X" shape, piercing enough meat to hold that flattened shape.Now, you're ready to cook your chicken.

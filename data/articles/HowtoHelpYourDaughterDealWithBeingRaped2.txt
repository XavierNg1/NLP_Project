 Make sure she's physically healthy and that her rapist didn't do any permanent physical damage. Getting her checked out by a doctor immediately is the best way to help her recover physically.
 You need to know as soon as possible about any diseases she's contracted so that you can get them treated effectively. If any test comes back positive, work with your daughter and her doctor to seek immediate treatment. Many STDs are perfectly curable, but some are not. If she has one of these, help her understand that there are solutions; having an STD will not prevent her from finding love or living a fulfilled life.
 If she is pregnant, discuss with her the options. If she doesn't want to keep the baby, consider abortion. If she doesn't want an abortion or if this is against her belief systems, she can still give the baby up for adoption after they're born. If she chooses to keep them, help her with her pregnancy and with parenting after the baby is born. No matter what she chooses to do, make sure to let her know that it's not her fault and that you support her wholeheartedly.


Make sure whatever your daughter chooses to do is her choice. You can advise her, but she should ultimately choose what to do. Your job is to help her make an informed decision and, more importantly, to fully support whatever decision she makes.

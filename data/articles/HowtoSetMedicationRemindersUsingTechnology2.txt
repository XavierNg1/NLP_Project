 If you’re already using the calendar feature of your digital device(s) to keep track of business meetings, salon appointments, and birthday parties, why not add medication reminders to the list? Even with minimal tech skills, you should be able to add time-specific reminders and synchronize them across your devices.


With or without using the calendar function, you can set reminders on phones and digital devices that run on various operating systems.
Don’t just assume that you have a good memory and surely will be able to remember to take a couple of pills every day. It is surprisingly easy to forget amidst a busy daily schedule.
 Whether you prefer a smartphone or an old-fashioned bedside clock, most of us are familiar with using alarms to wake up. Well, if you can set an alarm to signal rise-and-shine-time, you can also set one to remind you that it is time to take your pills.


Most digital clocks and watches, and all cell phones, will permit you to set multiple alarms per day. Set them to coincide with your medication schedule — for instance at 8 am, 2 pm, and 8 pm.
If you have difficulty remembering not just to take your pills, but which pills to take, you should not rely on this method alone.
 It may be a bit annoying to call your Uncle Joe with the same “take your pills” reminder every day, but it is a simple, cheap, direct, and effective way to improve the odds of medication compliance. This may also be the best method if the person requiring assistance is an extreme technophobe, and wants nothing to do with fancy cell phones, the internet, or newfangled pill machines with (literal) bells and whistles.


Keep in mind how important medication adherence is to overall health. Thousands of people go to the hospital and billions of dollars are spent each year because of medication non-compliance.

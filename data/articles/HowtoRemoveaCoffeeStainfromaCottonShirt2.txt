 Test the lemon juice first by swabbing a little on the inside collar. If the fabric doesn't turn yellow, treat the stain with more lemon juice, let sit, and rinse off. Rinse the stain first if the coffee contained a lot of sugar, as this can react with acid to add a new, brownish-yellow stain that's tough to take out.
 You can buy hydrogen peroxide from a pharmacy, or color safe bleach from anywhere that sells household supplies. Test colored fabric first by swabbing a little onto the inside collar. If the color isn't affected, rub over the stain and let sit for a about thirty seconds before rinsing off. If stain persists, apply without rubbing and wait another thirty seconds, then rinse. Repeat as necessary.









If the coffee stain has already set, mix the hydrogen peroxide with some dishwashing liquid or liquid soap before applying.
Color safe bleach usually includes hydrogen peroxide. If one doesn't work, the other probably won't either.
You can use regular bleach instead, for white shirts.
 Sprinkle some baking soda onto a wet piece of cloth. Use the cloth to blot out the stain.
 Apply some rubbing alcohol onto the stain. Blot with a clean, wet cloth. Rinse.
 Beat an egg yolk, and add a little warm water. Rub the mixture onto the stain using a sponge or a terry cloth. Rinse.
 Soak the stain with water and lay the shirt over a towel in direct sunlight. Many stains will disappear after two or three days of hot sun, and it may make the fabric look more vivid as well.

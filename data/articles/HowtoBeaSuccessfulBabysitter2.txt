 When you first begin babysitting it is a good idea to start working for a family you already know. This allows you to gain experience in a setting where you are comfortable and have a preexisting relationship with the family.This could include family members, friends, or neighbours.
 Once you have some experience and are ready to take on more work, you need to make it known to others that you are looking for babysitting jobs. You can ask friends and family for a referral, if they know anyone who might be looking for a good babysitter.You can also use social media to let your contacts know that you are available for childcare or create pages devoted to your babysitting business.
Additionally, you can create fliers to promote your services and post them on community center bulletin boards or other community or childcare job boards.
 Word of mouth is very important and people tend to use recommendations from friends when hiring a babysitter. Displaying that you are responsible, dependable, punctual, respectful, and enthusiastic about babysitting will help you gain a positive reputation as a babysitter.For example, don’t cancel on a job at the last minute. Show that you are dependable and if you have to cancel a job, make sure you give the parents enough time to find another sitter.
Always arrive at an appropriate time. Don't be late and if it's your first time babysitting for a family arrive 10 to 15 minutes early to go over information with the parents before they leave.
You should present yourself as someone who enjoys babysitting and spending time with children. It doesn’t look good if you seem annoyed by children or apathetic about the job.

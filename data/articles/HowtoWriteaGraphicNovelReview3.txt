 You need to provide the graphic novel's title, author and artist, and genre. You should also include the publisher and copyright/release date, the format (hardcover or softcover), and, if writing the review to encourage others to buy the graphic novel, its price and ISBN number.


If the graphic novel is a compilation of a story arc presented across several issues of a comic book, you should list the original comics that carried the story. Include the dates of publication if there is the possibility of confusion due to issue renumbering, such as DC Comics 2011 reboot of all its titles, all of which were reset to Issue #1.
If the characters in the graphic novel are not well-known but appear in other media, such as a webcomic, you should mention the other media they appear in, including web links as appropriate.
 This step is most appropriate for original graphic novels or those compiled from limited comic book series instead of from a story arc in a regular comic book. The purpose may be covered or alluded to in a written preface or may also be discussed in an interview of the author/artist, but in many cases you can deduce it by careful reading of the graphic novel itself.
 You do this on 2 levels, describing the plot of the story and by covering themes expressed in the work.


The plot is the basic story. Identify the major characters, describe the setting, and mention the story's major events, but don't give away the ending or any surprises.
The theme is a specific portion of the subject of the work. For example, in Alan Moore's "Watchmen," one theme would be how superheroes would affect the "real" world and be affected by it if they lived in it. A work may encompass several themes, or deal with several variations of a theme. For example, in "Watchmen," the theme of superheroes as being on the fringe of humanity is represented by Rorschach's partial insanity and Dr. Manhattan's increasingly detached behavior as a result of perceiving all of time at once.
 Discuss the pacing of the story: the amount of time spent in building up the main conflict, the conflict itself, and its resolution (without stating how the conflict is resolved). Note the dialog and whether it makes sense for the character speaking it, and for a juvenile graphic novel, how appropriate it is for the reader. Cover any literary techniques used in the work, such as the use of allegory, metaphor, and symbolism.


Note that in a graphic novel, the artwork supplements and sometimes replaces the use of words to convey images to the reader's mind.
 Describe the general artistic style (realistic, cartoon-like, manga) and how it is used in the story (earth tones for a nature goddess, dead, gnarled trees in a graveyard, red strips on the walls of government offices to represent "red tape," etc.). Also note any unusual placements of panels, such as Alan Moore's choice to use a 3 x 3 panel grid for "Watchmen" instead of the usual 2 x 4 grid, and how they impact the pacing of the story.
 In addition to providing a description of the graphic novel's high points and low points, you need to identify what, for you, were the high and low points, with concrete examples to back up your assertions.


Depending on the audience you're writing for, you can express your opinions in first-person ("I liked 'Gates of Gotham' becauseï¿½") or in third-person ("The Nightrunner character would have been better served by including the story of how he came to join up with Batman.") Choose whichever style you're most comfortable with, unless the venue you're writing for requires a particular style, and stick with it.

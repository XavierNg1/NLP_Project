 In a large mixing bowl, crack both eggs and whisk them together, blending the egg whites with the yolks. After they are mixed, pour in 1 tsp (5 ml) of coconut oil and 1 tbsp (15 ml) of water. Continue to blend the ingredients together until they are well-incorporated.As an alternative to coconut oil, you can also use 1 tsp (5 ml) of ghee, a type of clarified butter.;
, Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with your eggs, coconut oil, and water and stir it with a large spoon or whisk. After you've mixed it, let it sit for five minutes to allow the flour to soak up some of the moisture. Once you've allowed it to set, continue to mix everything together until the consistency of your mixture is uniform throughout the bowl., The next step to creating your tortillas is to cook them on your stove top. Turn the burner on your stove to medium-high heat, then once your oil starts to smoke, reduce the heat to medium-low. , Pour 1/3 of a cup of batter into the hot oil. Tip the pan around so that the batter forms into a nice 6-inch (15.24 cm) circle. You can also use a spatula to help you flatten out your tortilla., After you've let the tortilla cook for 1-2 minutes, flip it over and cook it on the other side. The tortilla will start to cook, harden, and turn golden brown. Once one side is cooked, flip the tortilla over and cook the other side., Allow your tortillas to cool. The paper towel will absorb some of the oil inside of the tortillas. Season the tortillas with additional salt for taste.

 Sugar leads to higher acidic levels in your body. To help alkalize your body, you should eliminate sugar completely, and if you canâ€™t do that, then you should significantly reduce the sugar in your diet.This includes all forms of sugar: white sugar, brown sugar, honey, fructose, maple syrup, and other sugar products.
Start by cutting out sugary snacks, like cookies, candy, and other baked goods. You can also cut out fruit juices and sugary sodas. Then you can try to cut out sugary foods in your meals, especially breakfast. Replace sugary cereals and jams with healthier options, like avocado and sprouted bread.
 Meats are believed to raise the acidity in your body and are not alkaline foods. This includes processed meats, like deli meats and cold cuts, along with beef, chicken, pork, and eggs. Meat from animals that are not grass-fed can increase acidity.Choose meats from grass-fed, organic sources.
 Bread is a food many diets advise against. Bread, along with most grain and gluten containing foods, is highly acidic. This means you should cut out all breads, along with whole grain crackers, and tortillas.If you want to eat bread, go for gluten-free or sprouted grains. You may also consider products made from alkaline grains, such as amaranth and millet.
 Most condiments are very acidic, so they will reduce the alkalinity of your body. This includes ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, miso, and salad dressings. Instead, try replacing them with pH foods, such as avocados or olive oil., Most beverages will increase your acidity. Acidic beverages include soda, coffee, fruit juice, milk, and alcohol. To increase your alkalinity, reduce your intake of these drinks and replace them with water, herbal tea, or coconut water, and nut milks.These drinks also contain other acid-forming substances, such as sugar and caffeine.

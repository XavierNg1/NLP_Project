 Remember that you'll need room for the amount of candy and vodka. If you're making a small batch, a quart sized Tupperware container is doable. Larger batches may require several wide-mouthed mason jars.
 Add them to the containers., Always use the same amount of vodka of candy, so for example, if you used one cup of candy corn, measure out one cup of vodka. Carefully pour the vodka over the candy., Jiggle the container around so that the contents can mix together a little., This will allow the candy to dissolve into the vodka., You will want to get all the solids and sugars separated from the liquor as much as possible. If you don't have a metal strainer, a simple cheesecloth or coffee filter will do. Repeat straining after all sugars have been strained., If you're not using this immediately, chill it in the refrigerator until needed.

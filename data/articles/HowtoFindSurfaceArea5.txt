 A cylinder has two circular ends enclosing a rounded surface. The formula for surface area of a cylinder is SA = 2π*r2 + 2π*rh, where r equals the radius of the circular base and h equals the height of the cylinder. Round pi or π off to 3.14.2π*r2 represents the surface area of the two circular ends while 2πrh is the surface area of the column connecting the two ends.
The units of surface area will be some unit of length squared: in2, cm2, m2, etc.
 The radius of a circle is half of the diameter, or half the distance from one side of the center of the circle to the other.The height is the total distance of the cylinder from end to end. Using a ruler, take these measurements and write them down.


Example: r = 3 cm

Example: h = 5 cm


, To find the area of the base, you simply use the formula for area of circle, or π*r2. To complete the calculation, square the radius and multiply by pi. Multiply by two to take into account the second identical circle on the other end of the cylinder.Example: Area of base = π*r2 = 3.14 x 3 x 3 = 28.26 cm2

Example: 2π*r2 = 2 x 28.26 = 56.52 cm2


, This is the formula to calculate the surface area of a tube. The tube is the space between the two circular ends of the cylinder. Multiply the radius by two, pi, and the height.Example: 2π*rh = 2 x 3.14 x 3 x 5 = 94.2 cm2


, Add the surface area of the two circles to the surface area of the space between the two circles to calculate the total surface area of the cylinder. Note, adding these two pieces together allows you to recognize the original formula: SA =2π*r2 + 2π*rh.Example: 2π*r2 + 2π*rh = 56.52 + 94.2 = 150.72 cm2

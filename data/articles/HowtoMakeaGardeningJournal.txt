 This could be a more casual record of your activity or a repository of essential information.


If you are a more casual gardener who merely wants to look back and see what you've done, a simple diary will suffice. If you are a more serious gardener, especially someone hoping to use or sell produce from your garden, keeping a gardening journal will be an essential part of planning your future activity.;
,


For a simple journal, use a notebook or diary, or even graph paper if you just want to record planting dates. For a more serious journal, choose a large binder to which you can add paper and pouches for seeds.
Electronic formats are also an option. For a diary-like journal on a computer, use a word processing program and create a new page or file for each entry. For a journal with measurements or statistics, use a data organization program like Microsoft Excel. There are also apps available for smartphones, such as Garden Pro and Master Gardener.
 These may be chronological, topical, or practical.


You may choose to have a section for each growing season, or to divide your journal into plant types. Additionally, you might have different sections for seed notes, weather notes, and financial data. In all cases, you can use each section either as a diary or as a folder for information.
, You will want to be able to bring your journal into your garden.
 Leave space after each entry so that you can come back later and add notes or edit what you have written.

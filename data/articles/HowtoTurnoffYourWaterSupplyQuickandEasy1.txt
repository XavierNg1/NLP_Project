 Most fixtures will have an individual shut off located beneath the fixture.It will likely be a chrome valve. Sinks and showers may have two valves, one for hot and one for cold. Turn each of the valves off to shut off all the water.


Some appliances such as washing machines, dish washers or refrigerators may have a water shut off switch on the body of the appliance or on the hose that connects to wall.
To shut off water to a water heater, look for a cold water valve directly above the water heater on a connected pipe.;
, This will cut off the water to the fixture. You will still be able to use running water in other fixtures or appliances throughout the rest of the home.


Tip: If the valve seems difficult to turn you may want to wear a work glove to protect your hand. You can also use a wrench if necessary.
 The water will no longer run to the specific appliance. You may need to drain a little bit of water that is remaining in the pipes of the fixture, so it is a good idea to keep a bucket handy. When you are finished, turn the valve counter-clockwise to turn the water supply back on.

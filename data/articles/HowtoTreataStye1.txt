 Styes are similar to pimples that form on the eyelid. Styes occur when bacteria (usually staphylococcus or “staph” bacteria) that live on the skin’s surface cause infections in or near the eye. You can usually identify a stye from its appearance -- a tender red lump on the eyelid which may develop a small pus-filled center.The stye develops inside the lid and protrudes either outward or inward. External styes involve Zeis or Moll glands and protrude out. Internal styes involve the meibomian gland and tend to protrude inward. An internal stye is just an infected chalazion.;
, Styes can be confused with chalazions, which also appear as a bump near the eye. The treatment of a stye and a chalazion is the same, so it's not a problem if you can't tell them apart.


A stye or hordeolum is caused by bacterial infection. These red lumps are often filled with pus, like a pimple. Styes cause pain and swelling of the eyelid.A chalazion is a cyst or fluid-filled sac that develops in the small oil glands (meibomian glands) near your eyelids. They more often appear at the inner side of the eyelid. Unlike styes, they are painless.Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid. Blepharitis have many causes, including infection, allergies, and untreated chalazions, Blepharitis makes the edges of your eyelids become red and swollen. Your eyelids may be itchy, crusty, or difficult to open., Your eyelid will usually swell up as the stye develops. In some cases the swelling may cause your eyelid to close completely. The swelling will usually last for about three days, after which it will sometimes burst and drain on its own. Occasionally, the inflammation will spread to areas of the face surrounding the eye, in which case you should see a doctor., The swollen eyelid can irritate the eye, causing pain and watering. Your eyes may also be more sensitive to light. The swelling may cause discomfort when you blink.

 The tiles are divided into 7 suits; 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s and 6s. The double is the highest tile in the suit, so for the 2 suit, the order is 2-2, 2-6, 2-5, 2-4, 2-3 and 2-1, highest to lowest.
 The remaining tile is placed face down on the middle of the table., The first bidder is determined and then the bidding will go round in a clockwise direction.

The bids can be "pass" (no bid), a number between 4 and 7, or 21. Each number bid must be higher than the last (e.g. Player A bids 4, B bids 5, C bids 6). A bid of 21is known as shooting the moon, which is a bid to take all tricks. The bidding stops instantly at this point, and whoever bid 21 wins the auction.
The winner of the auction (the one with the highest bid) takes the tile from the middle and then discards one tile from his hand face down without showing it.


Doubles: The trumps will be (highest to lowest): 6-6, 5-5, 4-4, 3-3, 2-2, 1-1 and 0-0.

No trump: There will be no trump.


If the tile played is a trump, the other players must attempt to play trumps as well. If a player doesn't have any trump tiles, they can play any tile.
If it isn't a trump, then the higher number on the domino played is the suit to be followed. Other players must attempt to play tiles with this suit. If a player can't follow the suit, they can play any tile.
 When anyone plays a trump, they highest trump wins the trick. If no trump is played, the highest ranked tile played wins the trick.

The winner of this trick stacks the three tiles of the trick face down in front of them and then leads any tile to the next trick.
The game continues like this until all the cards have been played.
 The game ends when someone reaches 21 points.

If a bid is successful (number of tricks won is more than bid, or if 21, all seven tricks are won), the bidder scores the amount of the bid. If they don't win, they lose that amount of points.
The other two players score one point for each trick won.

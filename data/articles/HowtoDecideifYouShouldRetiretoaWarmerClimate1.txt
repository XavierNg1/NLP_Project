, If you’re really into mountain climbing, you might have a hard time engaging in this activity in a warmer climate when you retire. Look for a location in a warmer climate that you will be able to continue enjoying the interests and activities that matter to you.The best way to identify whether you’ll be able to engage in the activities and interests that matter to you in a warmer climate is to visit the location you’re’ thinking of retiring to, then trying to do them.

 Before retiring to a warmer climate, you should know a bit about the weather. You might know that the place has warmer weather, but that warmth could become uncomfortable after a bit and may be tied to other, less pleasant climatic phenomenon.For instance, you might reason that Florida has a warmer climate and would therefore be a great place to retire to. But Florida also has a high number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and – consequently – floods.Warmer climates also attract more bugs, including mosquitoes.

community education classes in art or an academic subject
volunteering opportunities
support groups if you experience loss or illness

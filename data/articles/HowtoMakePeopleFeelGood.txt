 People tend to feel good when they hear their name. Sometimes people also love friendly nicknames-for example: if they love football,you can acknowledge that by calling them "Footy Queen/King"! Do not call someone a nickname if they wouldn't appreciate that, and you know that already. Instead, just say their real name.;
, People always feel good about themselves when they are teaching people - and when the person gets it right, it is a great feelingÂ !

, Even if you don't like a person, you can always find one thing that you like about them. It could be the car they drive or the watch they wear.
 This will show them that you are really listening. All too often we want people to hear us. Most often we want to impose our opinion or we want to tell a person what they should have done in a situation, or what you would have done. If you just listen, and I really mean really listen, not just nod and be forming a reply in your head, people really feel good when they know someone is listening.
 Put yourself in their position and really understand what they are saying or going through. People feel good when they know someone understands what they are saying.
 If you just smile at someone, it will make them feel more at ease.
 Then when you see them you can ask "How is Linda?", or "Still building the model boats?" Remembering important facts about a person makes them feel like they are special.
 This is a pretty simple one. If someone is in need and you help them, it will show them that someone cares.
 But all of them must be natural. Feel the beauty (think about it - it's the perfect plural!) of loving someone.

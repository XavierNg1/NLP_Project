 Some shampoos like Suave or VO5 or Garnier Fructis aren't exactly designed for our hair or don't have enough moisturizing ingredients. Although depending on what texture your hair is, you can use those products. Other hair companies like Cr√®me of Nature, Kera Care, Elasta QP, Organic Root Stimulator, Mane n' Tail, or related are have moisturizers that help keep hair shiny, silky, and healthy.


Avoid using shampoos and conditioners with mineral oil, petrolatum, or Sodium Lauryl/Laureth Sulfate (SLS). If you do have dandruff, Head and Shoulders has a great line of products and smell good too. But make sure to use a good moisturizing conditioner.;
, Make sure that the whole head is wet so that applying shampoo would be a little easier. If you want, spend a little more time going through hair/ scalp.
 This will help get the buildup from the scalp as well as hair. Do not pile hair on top of your hair and don't use your nails. Rinse hair out and repeat.
 Take a comb and comb through your hair with the conditioner still in it so that it will be tangle free out of the shower also. If you are impatient, you can take a shower while you wait. Now rinse hair out but with just a little touch of conditioner in hair. This helps to make your hair softer.
 DO NOT rub the towel on your hair. If you want to dry your hair without heat, twist your hair with the towel in a turban.

 Get lost in an adventure by using a book to stir your imagination. Curl up on the sofa or in the bed and have a mini-adventure in your head. If you’re not interested in fairy tales or fiction, there’s always non-fiction.


If you don’t care for reading, write in your journal to express your thoughts instead.
 There is so much to see and do on the internet. Read the news. Read blogs or websites, or make a blog or a website yourself. If you want something more interactive, shop, play games or discover other things to do.
 There are so many ideas to learn and contemplate. You can watch alternative news, or watch a tutorial on how to do something. Or, you could simply entertain yourself by watching a show published on the platform or one of the many YouTube content creators on virtually any subject you can imagine such as beauty, comedy, books, fashion., Ted and Tedx brings speakers together to discuss a variety of topics. Usually, the talks are about 20 minutes or less, and the topics vary from everything to linguistics to design. Watch talks and learn from authors, researchers, scientists, designers and many others.

 To be safe, don't put Vitamin E oil, gel, or capsules on your scar., Hydrogen peroxide has the effect of destroying skin cells. By using hydrogen peroxide, you’ll inhibit the growth of healthy cells and prolong the longevity of a scar.


Instead of using hydrogen peroxide to clean a wound, try antibiotic ointment or aloe vera., Many people recommend allowing a cut or scar to “breathe.” Unfortunately, this has the impact of inhibiting cell growth. Instead, cover your cut and keep it moist with aloe vera or something similar.


Use an adhesive bandage or gauze to cover the cut or scar., Whenever a wound or scar is healing, you should stay out of the sun. Sun exposure could undermine the ability of the skin to heal correctly. It could make the scar worse. As a result, if you must go outside, make sure to wear a wide-brimmed hat, long clothes, and sunscreen.

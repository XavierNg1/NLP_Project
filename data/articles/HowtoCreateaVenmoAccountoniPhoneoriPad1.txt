Tap INSTALL. Venmo will now download to your device. When the installation is complete, the Venmo icon will be added to your home screen.;
, It’s the blue icon with a white “V” on your home screen., This option helps you quickly add Facebook friends to Venmo (as long as they are also using Venmo)., There are two ways to do this:

Select Log in with the Facebook app if you have the app installed. Tap OPEN to launch the app, then tap Continue As <your name>.
Select Log in with phone or email if you don’t have the Facebook app. You’ll be prompted to enter the login information you use to access Facebook. If prompted, tap Continue As to give Venmo permission to access your account.

Once the password is accepted, a “Verify Phone” screen will appear., Venmo will now send an SMS text message to your phone to confirm your account.

If you didn’t receive the code, tap Resend code to try again.
 Once the code is entered, you’ll see the “Profile” screen., This name will be associated with your Venmo account. You can give this name to your friends so they know how to pay you., If you don’t want to do this, tap Not Now instead., Now Venmo will ask who you want to add from your iPhone or iPad’s contacts list., Tapping a contact’s name adds them to the list. If you’re having trouble finding someone, use the search bar at the top of the screen. Your Venmo account is now active.

If you don’t want to add contacts, tap Skip at the top-right corner.

 Don’t be afraid of being random! It can be when you wake up, before you go to bed or when you’re doing homework. People love to know that they matter to someone else!


One of the best ways to do this is to send a quick text. It doesn’t have to be anything more complicated than “Thinking of you. :)”, No matter what they’re talking about. They may want your opinion, or just want to know that you care about what bothers them. You don’t need to listen like they’re your teacher and you’re taking notes for the test, but pay attention. Ask questions and comment sometimes to show that you’re listening.


If they’re talking about a problem with a friend, you can ask questions about their history, or their motivations.
General comments, like “I can’t believe it!”, “Tell me more about that” and “I see” show that you’re listening., That’s not to say that you should always agree with what they say, but you shouldn’t be trying to win. Be nice, and always try to fix the problem instead of just wanting to be the one who’s right. This shows that you’re mature and care more about fixing a problem than just winning.


A common argument in middle school is how often you see your partner. Instead of trying to just get what you want, try to find a middle ground that works for both of you., It’s easy, especially in a new relationship, to want to spend as much time with your partner as possible. You have to try and let your partner do their own thing. Strike a balance between letting your partner enjoy their hobbies without you and getting some quality time together. This will create a more trusting relationship with less negative feelings.

, This is the first most important thing to do. Calm yourself down as much as possible and read through the instructions. Start with your name or student ID, and fill out any other required housekeeping information at the beginning. Then read each question very carefully. Read through the questions several times until you feel comfortable about understanding the content and what is expected of you by way of answers.
 Tell them that you have problems in the actual testing situation despite having learned all of the material. They might be able to assist you, such as providing additional tuition, helping you learn how to break down instructions, or even investigating improving the testing environment in ways that help you.
 Use deep breathing and try not to let panic overwhelm your thoughts. Remind yourself regularly that you have learned this information and that it is all in your head for accessing.
 Sometimes you might have a problem in filtering information adequately to comprehend it well enough under pressure. It can be helpful to have this tested and to get advice on dealing with comprehension problems if this is an issue for you.
 If you have a learning disorder or suffer from anxiety problems, being placed under pressure in a test or exam situation can cause trauma and can hamper your ability to respond well. Speak with a health professional about any concerns, need for testing or diagnosing, and solutions to any issues.
 Try to stay calm, and just try your best as this is all you can do.
 This will help you plan your time during the exam and stay calm. Don't rush the questions, read them thoroughly and answer them carefully.

 In levels 4 and 6 of the First Quest (the first half of the game), and levels 2, 5, and 6 of the Second Quest (second half), Gleeok appears only as a mini boss. You can find him inside the Mini Boss rooms of these levels.;
, As a mini boss, Gleeok will only have two to three heads. Once you enter the Mini Boss room, it will pop out the wall and begin attacking you.


Gleeok will start weaving its two to three heads through half of the floor. Its heads will also start shooting fireballs in random directions. Try to dodge these attacks by constantly moving around the floor.
 While avoiding its attack, slowly move towards its head. Once you get close enough, slash one of its head with your sword. It takes ten blows of your wooden sword to destroy just one head.


Do this to each of Gleeokâ€™s heads to defeat the monster.

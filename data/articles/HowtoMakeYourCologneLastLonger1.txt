 The steam from a warm shower or bath helps open your pores, so your skin will absorb the fragrance more readily. That helps the scent linger throughout the day, and keeps you from having to reapply., Hydrated skin is more likely to soak up your cologne than dry, parched skin, so it’s a good idea to apply a body lotion or cream over your entire body beforehand, paying particular attention to areas where you plan to spritz the cologne.If you don't want to alter the scent of your cologne, be sure to choose an unscented moisturizer.
Because hydrated skin holds onto to fragrance better than dry skin, people with oily skin usually don’t need to reapply their cologne as often.
 Moisturizing your skin can help it soak up the cologne more easily, but if you really want the fragrance to “stick” all day, dab some petroleum jelly, such as Vaseline, on your pulse points where you plan to spray the scent. The petroleum jelly acts as a barrier between your skin and the cologne, so your body’s oils aren’t able to break the fragrance.Petroleum jelly can stain clothing, so be sure to rub it into your skin until the area isn’t greasy to the touch.

For example, if you bank with Chase, you would download and install the Chase Mobile App from the iPhone app store.
If you are not sure of the name of the app, go to your bank's website and select mobile banking. Your bank should provide a link to the appropriate app.
If your bank does not provide a link to the app, type the name of your bank in the search field at the iPhone app store to bring up a list of apps with that name. The mobile banking app should appear on that list.
If your bank does not provide a link and a search does not return the appropriate result, contact your bank's customer service for information on how to use an iPhone to deposit checks.;

Depending on your bank, you might be required to enter your account information or social security number and set up a PIN for mobile access.



Banks will vary but, many require you to endorse, or sign, the back of the check, you might need to include your account number as well, and photograph both sides to submit to your bank.
The app will walk you through the process.

 Tape this chart to a cupboard door and then use it to help prepare your meals. Mark off the items used.;
, Food that has passed the buy by date or use by date should be tossed.
, Try to shop weekly and stick to the aforementioned grocery list.
 Do not splurge and buy 12 dozen widgets, for example, if they are on sale. Buy only what you need --- no more.
 In one area place all the staples such as flour, sugar, and baking supplies. In another area store the canned goods. Sort by type of canned goods. Have an area for canned vegetables, canned fruits, etc. This will help compartmentalize your foodstuffs and help with your shopping list. It will also help you use up what you have as you will know where to look for a needed item.
, Seek medical help and receive treatment.
 Set aside a specific area and buy emergency food supplies. Again, research to determine the amount of food that is needed per person. Buy only what you need for one person for a set period of time. Visit the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) web site for details.

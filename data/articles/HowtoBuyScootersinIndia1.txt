 Do you want a fancy, high-end scooter even though it may be more expensive, or do you want a more affordable one? Generally, you can buy a new scooter for anywhere between INR38,000 and INR85,000, but scooter capabilities and quality vary greatly with the price. Decide how much money you're willing to spend on a scooter, as this will guide your shopping.;
, Are you looking for a scooter with a powerful engine that can go really fast, or are you more interested in a simple scooter with good mileage that will get you safely where you need to go? Scooters can also come with a charging port for mobile phones, digital speedometer, and other extras, so think about which of these you want in yours.
 Are you the only person who will ride it on a day-to-day basis? Do you plan to carry a passenger? Make sure the scooter will be safe and comfortable for everyone who might use it regularly, and check for the pillion rider comfort and safety.
 Use the decisions you made through the steps above to guide your choices when creating this list. Do plenty of research on each model you add to the list, and begin to narrow down the options.
 Go to a dealer or showroom and discuss your options with the salesman there. Test drive a few of your top choices to see which one you like best. Then use all the information you've gathered to make a final decision.
 Choose a payment plan and discuss the waiting period. If you opt to finance the scooter, choose the lowest interest rates and the best payback plans from all the available banks. Don't make the full payment until you have your scooter ready to go.
 Never forget to wear a helmet, and drive safely by obeying the laws of road.

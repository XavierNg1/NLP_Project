 Most Brita water bottles have a removable filter, so take this out of the cap and set it aside. Place it on a clean surface so that you don’t contaminate it. It’s not necessary to clean your filter, but you should replace it as directed.Water bottle filters should be replaced roughly every two months.;
, Brita water bottles can withstand high temperatures, but be sure not to use water that is nearly boiling. Hot water from the faucet is sufficient. Use a few drops of mild dishwashing detergent, such as Dawn or Palmolive to wash the bottle.
 Put the cap back on the bottle and shake it for a little bit so that suds form. Shake the bottle right side up for 10 seconds or so and then flip it upside down and shake it for a while longer. This gives the bottle a good initial clean.
 Take the cap off of the bottle and wipe it down with a washcloth and soapy water. Clean the mouthpiece carefully and be sure to wipe all around the inner edges where the cap screws onto the bottle. Rinse the cap thoroughly after you wash it.Set the cap out to dry on a drying rack or clean dish towel. Once the cap is dry, be sure to put the filter back in before you use the bottle.
 Shaking soapy water will get the bottle mostly clean, but a quick scrub finishes the job. As best as you can, swish a washcloth around and get the whole inside. Rinse all of the soap out afterward.


Place the bottle upside down to dry, or dry it with paper towels to avoid leaving fibers from a cloth towel.

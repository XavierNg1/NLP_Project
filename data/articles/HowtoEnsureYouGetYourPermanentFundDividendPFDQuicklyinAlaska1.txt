 The Permanent Fund Dividend is also called the Alaska Dividend. Each year, Alaska invests part of its oil revenue into this investment fun. Many states have investment funds, but Alaska is the only one who provides every citizen with an annual dividend from the fund. Since 1982, Alaskan citizens have received annual income from the PFD. This money is given to every man, woman, and child who is a citizen of the state.;
, There are several requirements residents must meet to be eligible to receive their dividend. You must have lived in Alaska for a full calendar year and you must intend to remain in Alaska indefinitely. Additionally, cannot have claimed residency in any other states during that year. Your criminal history is also taken into account. You cannot have been convicted of a felony in the past calendar year. If you were incarcerated, you are not eligible for the dividend.
If you were absent from Alaska for more than 180 days, you need to make sure it was an allowable absence. Check with the governor's office to make sure your absence was approved.
 If you don't meet the requirements for this year, you can take steps to ensure that you are eligible for the next dividend. The most important thing you can do is to establish residency. It is not enough to simply be physically present in Alaska.In order to establish residency, you must:


Move to Alaska;
Prove your intent to stay, which could be done by buying a home, getting a job, registering to vote, or registering a vehicle;
Preserve documents that prove your residency;
Sever connections to other states; and
Maintain the residency requirements for one year.

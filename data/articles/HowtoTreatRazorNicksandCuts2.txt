 This will help stop the bleeding and give you a better idea of how severe the wound is., Find a tissue, a wad of toilet paper, or a towel and press down on the area where the bleeding seems the most severe. Apply pressure to the wound for 5 to 15 minutes.If blood soaks through the cloth, add another cloth without lifting up the one on the wound.
If applying firm pressure did not stop the bleeding, you can pinch the skin together with your skin and index finger, which should help stop the bleeding.
If this technique doesn’t work and you continue bleeding, seek medical attention as soon as possible.
 If possible, try to elevate the body part with the wound so it is positioned above the heart. This should help slow down blood flow to that area., After the bleeding stops, use hydrogen peroxide, iodine, or an antibiotic cream on the affected area. This will help prevent infection and ensure the cut heals faster.
 Place a sterile bandage on the wound to keep dirt and bacteria out and prevent the bleeding from starting again.Change the bandage if blood soaks through or it gets wet. This will help keep the wound clean and dry.
 If the cut was not too severe, you can probably remove the bandage from the wound after a few days. This will help it heal faster., If you are unable to stop the bleeding or notice any redness, irritation, or pus around the cut, it’s best to seek medical attention as soon as possible. A medical professional will be able to evaluate and provide appropriate care for your wound.

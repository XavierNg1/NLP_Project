 Gather 4-7 cleared branches (all of the leaves have fallen off), about 2-4' long each.
 Paint the branches with silver, gold, red, or whatever color paint you want. Using spray paint might be easier but get an adult to help with that part.
 Get a large pot or vase which will be sturdy enough to support the branches you gathered.
 Get colored twine or a pretty gift bow and tie it around the opening of the jar to make it look more festive.
 Fill up the pot or vase with river stones or gravel. This will weigh it down and help hold up the branches.
 Put the branches into the pot, anchoring them in the gravel or stones that you put at the bottom.
 You can add hand ornaments, paper leaves, cards, or wishes from the branches!

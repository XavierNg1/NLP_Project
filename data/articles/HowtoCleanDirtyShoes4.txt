 The first step to cleaning a pair of vinyl shoes is to remove any dirt or debris from the surface and sole of the shoes. Gently brush the shoes to remove the dirt before doing any further cleaning.
 A simple household eraser will help you eliminate any scuffs or smudges from your vinyl shoes. Gently erase these marks with either an art eraser or a regular pencil eraser. Be sure not to use too much pressure.
 Find a soft, clean cloth such as an old washcloth or hand towel and dampen it with lukewarm water. You can also add a drop of mild laundry detergent to the cloth. Gently wash the surface of the shoe. If using soap, wipe any soap debris remaining on the shoes with a damp clean cloth before drying.
 Once youâ€™ve finished wiping down your vinyl shoes, allow them to air dry before wearing. Place the shoes in a safe space away from heat, direct sunlight, and air vents. Allow them to dry at least 30 minutes, if not longer, before wearing.

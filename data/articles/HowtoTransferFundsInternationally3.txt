 Some large banks offer special remittance services that allow you to transfer money abroad less expensively than using a wire transfer. However, the list of destination countries is typically less extensive than it would be using PayPal or a money transfer service like MoneyGram or Western Union.For example, Wells Fargo offers an ExpressSend service to 12 countries in Latin America and Asia, including Mexico, China, India, and the Philippines., Every bank is different, but generally, you will have to provide the bank certain information in order for them to process your request. Using Wells Fargo's ExpressSend's service as an example, you will need the following:The recipient's name, address, phone number, and the name of the Remittance Network member where the funds will be picked up.

The address must be an actual physical address. No PO Boxes are allowed.
Indicate whether the telephone number provided is from a land line or mobile phone.


You will need to know how the recipient of the transfer will receive the funds, cash or account deposit. If it will be deposited in their account, then you will have to provide the recipient's account number.
 Be sure to tell the recipient in what currency the money will be available. Wells Fargo, for example, uses local currencies for some countries and dollars for others. If the money is deposited in dollars, there may be additional fees to exchange the currency on the recipient's end.

The tutorial at the beginning will help you to decide what kind of fighting style suits you the most - be aware though, after you choose what race, class and birth sign you will be for the second time before exiting the sewers, you will not be able to change these attributes again. Fighting styles can include spell casting, using bows, swords, axes or numerous other weapons, or even no weapon at all or a mix of all.

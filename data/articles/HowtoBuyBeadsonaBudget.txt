 You can find beads made of almost any hard material: plastic, glass, stone, clay, crystal, ceramic, metal, wood, even bones or seeds. Beads come in a multitude of colors, shapes and sizes, and of course at a wide variety of price points.;
, While it may be fun to simply go to a bead store & buy everything that catches your eye, that's an easy way to completely blow your bead budget. Instead, look at the project or projects you'd like to complete and assess exactly what you need for each project, so you're not buying unnecessary beads or supplies.


If you want to use a pricier or fancier bead, make it the focus of your project, and use less expensive beads or other materials around your focal bead.
 Don't think of your local bead or craft store as the only place to get beads!:


Salvage beads from previous crafts or jewelry you may have made but don't want anymore.
Check out local thrift shops or garage sales for inexpensive beaded jewelry; simply take the jewelry apart and you have a ready source of beads to re-use.
Find natural materials such as stones, wood or seeds that fit the style of your project; drill a hole through and you've got yourself a lovely natural bead.
 You may not be able to afford to set up your own glass-blowing studio yet, but you can still make your own beads from paper, polymer clay, even recycled snack food bags!

, You may be able to set up bead swaps, where you can exchange beads you won't use for some new beads.

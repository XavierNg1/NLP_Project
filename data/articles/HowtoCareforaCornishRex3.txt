 Your cat’s short, wavy coat won’t require too much grooming. Brushing too much or too hard can in fact damage the coat. The motion of your hand when you pet your Cornish Rex is all the grooming its coat needs., A Cornish Rex has large ears, so you’ll need to check them regularly. Look inside its ears every week for mites, discharge, or irritation, and smell for any foul odors that might indicate infection. If you notice too much waxy build-up in the ear, use a cotton ball to clean the external part of the cat's ear. Do not put anything in its ear canal. If the ear appears red, smells bad, or if the cat keeps scratching its ear, take your cat to the vet., While they might not like having their teeth cleaned, oral hygiene is an important part of maintaining your cat’s health. Get your cat used to having its teeth touched by gently massaging around its mouth while you hold or pet it. Daily brushing is best, but a weekly cleaning is better than nothing.Use a cat toothbrush, which is smaller and has softer bristles than a toothbrush for humans. You can also use a cat toothbrush that fits over your finger.
Apply a small amount of cat toothpaste to the brush and gently massage your cat’s teeth and gums.
Bring your cat to the vet if you smell a foul odor coming from its mouth or see any sores or ulcers.
 Gently pet and massage its paws to prepare it for a nail trimming. Hold the paw and locate the quick, which looks like a small pink triangle inside the nail. Use a sharp pair of cat nail clippers to the trim the nail, and take care to avoid the quick and cut only the nail's tip.


Check your cat's nails for splits or breaks and to get a feel for how fast they grow. Trim them every two weeks to one month so they don't get too long or break.
You might only be able to trim one or two nails at a time, so have patience. Avoid trimming your cat's nails after playtime or when it's hungry.

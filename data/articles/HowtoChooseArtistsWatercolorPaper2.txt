 There are three general categories:



Hot-Press has a smooth surface, and is sometimes even labeled as "Smooth." It's your best bet if you work with fine detail, combine watercolor and fine pen-and-ink work, or use watercolor as a base for colored pencil.







Cold-Press has a noticeable texture that may not be suitable for extremely detailed work, but otherwise it's a versatile surface that lends itself to most watercolor techniques. Cold-press is the most commonly used surface, and if you're taking a beginning watercolor class your instructor will usually specify it on the supply list. There is no standard "cold-pressed" surface, however; the relative roughness of the paper and size of the grain varies between manufacturers. Strathmore's cold-press paper, for example, has a much larger grain, and thus a coarser appearance, than Arches.







Rough is--well, rough. It's great stuff if you're into bold brushwork and larger-scale paintings, but is generally not used by beginners.

 First, soak a cotton ball in the oil of your choice. Use the cotton ball to liberally dab your skin with the oil. If you use cooking spray, you can just spray it directly on your skin., Rub vigorously, but not so hard that you hurt your skin. The paint should start to thin out almost immediately.If you have trouble, try scrubbing the area with a washcloth. A washcloth also will come in handy if you’ve spray painted skin that’s not easy to clean in a sink, like your feet.  

, Once you’ve thinned out the spray paint, grab some hand soap, lather the area, and rinse. This will wash away the residual spray paint and oil.Try washing with hand soap at least twice if your hands are still oily or if any traces of spray paint remain.
 If oil didn’t remove all of the spray paint, you can try a pumice liquid soap, pumice bar soap, or pumice bar. Any method of using pumice should work, but be cautious with pumice if you have sensitive skin.


Pumice soaps are typically used to remove grease and grit from jobs like car maintenance. Pumice bars are often used to clean feet. You can find pumice products at your local convenience or drug store.

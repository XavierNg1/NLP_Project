 Set your oven to preheat while you complete the recipe. Line an 8x8 baking pan with parchment paper. Set it aside for now.
 Measure out the two ingredients and place them in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Beat them together (either by hand or with an electric mixer set on medium speed) until the ingredients are incorporated and the mixture looks creamy., Measure out these ingredients and place all of them into the bowl with the almond butter-coconut oil mixture. Beat the ingredients together until well-mixed., Measure out the coconut sugar, quinoa flour, salt and baking powder and place them together in a separate bowl. Use a whisk to mix them together until fully incorporated., Dump your bowl of dry ingredients into the bowl holding the coconut oil-almond butter mixture. Mix well until fully incorporated. Fold the chocolate chips into the batter., Pour the batter into the prepared 8x8 baking pan. Check to make sure the oven has fully preheated. Place the pan on the center rack in your oven and allow the blondies to bake for 25 to 30 minutes.

You’ll know they’re done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with only a few moist crumbs on it.
 After the blondies have finished baking, pull out the pan and set it aside. Allow the blondies to cool completely in the pan, then cut them into 12 to 16 squares. Store them in an airtight container, such as Tupperware, for up to five days.

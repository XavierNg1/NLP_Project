 Coat the bottom of a medium-sized skillet with the olive oil. Set your stovetop’s burner to medium heat. Once the oil heats up, place the sausage in the skillet and cook for roughly 5 minutes, or until it starts to crumble and turn golden. Then place the arugula in with it and continue to cook until the greens wilt., Once the sausage and arugula have cooked, switch off the heat. Give them approximately 10 minutes to cool off. Once they have, stir in your cream cheese, salt, pepper, and ⅓ cup of your Parmesan until they’re even mixed., First, set your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius). While that preheats, dust a surface with flour. Roll your dough out until it thins out to a rectangle that’s roughly 12 x 20 inches (30.5 x 51 cm). Use a knife or pizza cutter to slice it in half lengthwise. Then slice each half into 8 rectangles of equal size, for a total of 16., First, beat your egg in a small bowl. Then top each rectangle with your filling and brush their edges with the egg. Fold them in half, then use a fork to seal and crease the dough where its edges meet. Brush their tops with more egg., Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer your pockets to the sheet. Dust the tops with the extra Parmesan. Place them in the oven and bake for roughly 15 to 17 minutes, or until they turn golden.

 To keep your photos and videos organized, try sorting them into albums. You can do this using the Google Photos app or in a web browser.;
, The steps are a little different depending on your device:


Mobile: Tap the ⁝ icon and select “Album.” Now you’ll see a list of your photos, all with circles at their upper top corners.
Web: Click the + symbol next to the search box and select “Album.” Your photos will appear, all with circles at their top left corners.
 This will add the photo to the album. You can select as many photos as you’d like.


See Adding Photos to an Album to learn how to add additional photos later.
 Now you’ll see a text box that says “Untitled” above the album’s contents.
 You can call the album anything you want. Nobody will see the name unless you use the Google Photos sharing tools to share it with others.
 It’s at the top right corner of the screen. Like an album title, nobody will see the description except you., Your album is now live.


To view a list of all of your albums next time you sign in, click or tap the Albums icon (at the bottom of the app, and on the left side of the website). The icon looks like a square with a bookmark at its upper-right edge.

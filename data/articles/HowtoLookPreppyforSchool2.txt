 Looking preppy involves looking clean and well-maintained. For both men and women, hair should look well-maintained and controlled; the same applies for men's facial hair, which should be kept trimmed and tidy. Use hair spray, pomade, gel, clips, elastics, or other products to formulate sleek and subdued hair styles; Ivy League hair cuts typically incorporate a side part and combed-over hair., A key factor in preppy dress is the use of natural fabrics (e.g. cotton, wool, silk, lambskin suede), some of which tend to get wrinkled very easily. The preppy look embraces wrinkles as they are a testament to the quality of the fabric used to make a garment. Wear your preppy clothes with confidence and do not make an effort to press or iron things.This wrinkled look also conveys the relaxed, self-assured vibe of preppy style.
 Opt for minimal jewelry with your preppy attire. Men should reserve their accessories to a nice watch and, if applicable, a wedding band. Women can vary jewelry choices, but should try to match metals (e.g. yellow gold, platinum gold, silver) and opt for something conservative - for instance, a strand of pearls is the perfect addition to a preppy look.

A preppy look for women also involves being conservative with makeup.

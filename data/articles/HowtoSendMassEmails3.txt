 Contact your organization’s IT manager to learn the unique Listserv email that you can use to email everyone in your list. The owner should use the list responsibly and may need to agree to only use it for specific reasons.


The Listserv option is best when you are part of a large organization with an internal network, such as a University or company.
 You can find lists of people who are part of existing LISTSERV groups at http://www.lsoft.com/lists/LIST_Q.html To subscribe to a list, send an email to “LISTSERV@LISTSERV.NET” with the word “Subscribe” next to the name of the list.
 Look for the email that is used to send an email to the list. When you address an email to this unique address, the LSoft corporation sends the email to all subscribed email addresses.


The master LISTSERV email is the list name followed by the machine where the list is hosted. For example, “WRITING@SEAGATE.EDU.”

, Use a subject, a colon and a subtitle to follow LISTSERV email protocol.
 Send your email. It will go to all the emails who have previously subscribed to the list.

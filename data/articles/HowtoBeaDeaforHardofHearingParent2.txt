 Be a voice for your child’s needs by asking for necessary accommodations, attending meetings to plan your child’s education, and keeping up-to-date, accurate records. Ask questions and take an active role in coming up with solutions that support your child.As your child ages, include them in the decision making process and help them advocate for themselves.
 Your child deserves a good education, so consult with nonprofits and agencies that help individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to learn about your child’s rights. When you believe that someone is denying your child their rights, you should speak up about it.

Look online for resources.

What you choose for your child will depend on their needs and preferences. Students can attend a mainstream public or private school, a school for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, or homeschool.Students are more likely to receive specialized services if they attend a school.
Schools are also available online for a structured homeschooling option. Your child can get visually supported lessons made for students who are deaf or hard of hearing.
 Partner with your child’s teacher and support staff so that you are all working on the same educational goals.

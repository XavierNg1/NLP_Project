 Although it's probably fine to drink water from the heater during an emergency, it's best to be on the safe side.You can purify water by boiling it or using iodine or bleach in very small quantities. You can filter water in an emergency by layering filtering agents on top of each other.
 Factory valves do not have a straight path and have small orifices. In hard-water areas, those can easily clog with sediment buildup and then no water will flow from the tank.
 If you can't, for whatever reason, access your water heater in an emergency, don't panic. You should have plenty of other options. Consider these to get at potable water:


Possible indoor sources of water:

Liquid from canned fruit and vegetables
Water from the toilet tank (not the toilet bowl), unless it has been chemically treated with toilet cleaners
Water from melted ice cubes


Possible outdoor sources of water:

Water from a rainwater collection system.
Water from rivers, steams, springs, and other moving bodies of water
Water from ponds, dams, and lakes

 Olive oil and honey work together to deep condition your hair quickly, since the honey moisturizes your hair and the olive oil works to trap it in. Mix 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup olive oil in a bowl.
 Dampen your hair, then use a pastry brush or your fingers to apply the honey and olive oil mixture. Rub it into your hair from the roots to the tips, focusing on the spots that tend to get the driest. You may want to use a plastic shower cap to cover your treated hair.
 Since this is a quick conditioning method, the best way to apply heat is to use a hair dryer. Set your hair dryer to a medium setting and direct the warm air at your head for at least 10 minutes.









Change the positioning of the hair dryer regularly so your entire head of hair gets treated with heat.
 After 10-30 minutes, remove the plastic cap and rinse the honey and olive oil mixture out of your hair using cool water.Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. Towel dry your hair and then style as usual.

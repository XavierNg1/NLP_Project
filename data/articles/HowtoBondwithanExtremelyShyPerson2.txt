 Shy people often do not enjoy large, or even small, groups of people. Use one-on-one interactions with a shy person as a way to form a deeper bond — they will likely value time with someone who takes the time to authentically listen to what they have to say.


Remember your body language. Don’t stand too close to them and don’t hold eye contact for too long. Make it natural and comfortable.
For example, a one-on-one walk in the park is the perfect time to ask your shy friend, “How was your day at work?”

, You cannot and should not change them. Shy people have a lot of great qualities and can bring a lot into a friendship. They are often good listeners and make a great shoulder to lean on during troubling times.Avoid pointing out their shyness by saying something like, “Why are you being so quiet? Are you mad at me?” The shy person probably knows that they are shy and might even be self-conscious about it.
Don’t push them out of their comfort zone too quickly.
 Don’t lie or make excuses. Be honest about your feelings, thoughts, and opinions. Introverts are often slow to give their trust. You must earn and keep their trust. If you are caught lying or being dishonest you stand a chance at losing their trust, which may be difficult to get back.For example, if they ask you to go to dinner tomorrow night and you are not interested in going, don’t lie and tell them that you have other plans. Instead, politely decline their invitation and suggest that you get together another time.

 Once you understand why she doesn’t want to buy it, you can find solutions to those problems standing between you and the toy you want.If the toy costs too much money you can do chores to earn money and split the cost.
If she says that you have too many toys already, choose some to get rid of. You can get your mom to help you sell them online or in a garage sale to earn money to buy the toy you want.
 When you say, “What if,” you let your mom know that you understand she is in control and you are willing to do what it takes to get the toy.What if I clean my room?
What if I do the dishes for a week?
What if I promise to play with it only in my room so I don’t get in your way?

, She may try to put off buying the toy in hopes that you will give up. Find a reason why it is best to buy the toy right away. Make it seem like the perfect opportunity.Find a coupon or a store that has the toy on sale for a limited time.
If there are only a few toys left at the store, make sure you don’t miss out on getting one before they are gone.

 Use your Torx driver to remove these.


After you lift up the inner panel, the door latch mechanism should be exposed. You are going to need to separate the electrical connections from the switch, so use a screwdriver to pry them off. Be gentle to avoid damaging these components.;
,, With a flat screwdriver, pry off one end while you simultaneously lift the handle.



Two pivot points should be free at this point. Slide the handle forward, then lift the handle away from the dishwasher.



All you'll need to do is slide both of the two inner pivot points mentioned earlier. Fortunately, both of these points have been tapered, which makes the reattachment process a breeze.
 At this point, you can simply turn the latch in place so that it's facing down and then snap it at one of its sides with the use of the tapered pivot. This should allow the other side to slide in without any trouble. Make sure to note that this latch will remain in its locked position until you eventually re-install it in the dishwasher.
 You can easily find these by lifting up the door. There is plenty inside the dishwasher to push against the wires, so make sure they're not touching anything.
 Put it in place and set the handle through the slot on the door.


Put all eleven screws back on, then open the door to make sure that handle is working as it should. Turning on the dishwasher is the final test because a disconnected latch will actually prevent the dishwasher from starting at all.
As long as both of your tests work out, you've successfully fixed your dishwasher's door latch.

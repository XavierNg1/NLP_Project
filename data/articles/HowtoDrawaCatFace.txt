 The cross should bend the way the cat drawing is facing.;
,, The triangles may be erect, twisted, or down, as in pointing toward the ground. Avoid making them floppy, like dog ears, as this is not a cat's ear.
 Then, slightly below it, make a shape like a sideways "3" for the mouth.
 The eyes should be pointing in the direction the cross bends.(To make it cuter, draw the eyes larger,but not too large).
 Draw fur around and on top of the cat's head.
 Trace the outline of the cat's head, ears and neck. Trace the eyes, nose and mouth. Then, take an eraser and erase all of the pencil marks. You can also color your cat, choosing any range of cat colors and fur patterns for inspiration.

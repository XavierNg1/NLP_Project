 Glue one end of the string in place. Let it dry before proceeding with the winding of the string.;
, Using the sponge brush, apply some glue to the first section around the jar. Wrap the string around this area, taking care to keep the string closely aligned with each prior row; no gaps!

, Paint on a section of glue, wrap the string, then paint on another section, wind again, and so forth.
 Cut the string off when it can't be wound into place on the side of the jar any further. Tuck against the edge neatly to finish off and add extra glue to make the end firm.
 It can now be used for flowers, pencils, utensils, or anything else you'd like to keep inside it.

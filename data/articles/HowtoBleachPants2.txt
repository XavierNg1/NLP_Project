 In a clean plastic spray bottle, mix one part bleach with three parts water.
 Lay the pants you wish to bleach out flat on a plastic tarp or sheets of newspaper. This will prevent your flooring from becoming stained by the bleach.









If you only want to bleach one side of the jeans, stuff the legs full of balled-up newspaper to prevent the bleach from soaking through.
 As you will be spraying the bleach, it is a good idea to wear safety goggles to protect your eyes.
 Start spraying your jeans with the bleach. If you have a plastic bottle with an adjustable nozzle, you can decide whether you want to spray the jeans with a concentrated blast of bleach (for an all-over bleached effect) or lightly mist the jeans with bleach (for more of a weathered look).
 The great thing about this bleaching method is that you can be more precise in terms of the details you wish to add. Use masking tape to create a stencil on the pants (stars, stripes, crosses) and spray inside the stencil to create funky bleached designs.









Dip a paint brush into the bleach solution and, wearing latex gloves, flick the bristles backwards onto the pants to create a cool splatter effect with the bleach. Just be very careful to flick the bleach onto the pants and not onto your face.
Dip a sponge into the bleach mixture and dab it onto specific areas of the pants. Try dabbing it along the seams, around the pockets and along the belt line for a designer effect.
Use a bleach pen to draw more intricate designs onto the pants .
 Once you are happy with your designs, you should leave the bleach to sit on the pants for about five to ten minutes to soak in.
 Put the pants through a normal wash cycle in your washing machine, without adding detergent. Dry thoroughly.

 If your hair is long, you can use a hair dryer to rough dry your hair until it's about seventy percent dry. Alternatively, towel dry your hair to get it ready for styling.
 Use a wide-toothed comb to comb your hair and remove all tangles before you apply product and attempt to slick it. This will help keep the final appearance neat.
 Use your fingers to apply pomade to the top and sides, the areas you want to slick back. There's no need to apply pomade to the end of your hair.
 Use a fine-toothed comb to comb back from your forehead to the crown of your head. Comb from your temples to the back of your head. Finger-comb your hair to add volume and achieve the slicked-back look you want.
 Putting your hair into a ponytail or bun will help your slick stay in place and create a neater appearance. You could also do a half-ponytail or even a long braid.

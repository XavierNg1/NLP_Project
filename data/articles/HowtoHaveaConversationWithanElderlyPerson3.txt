 Notice whether the person you’re talking to is hard of hearing, has memory problems, or otherwise has trouble communicating. Adjust your own communication style so they can participate in the conversation more easily.For instance, if the person is having a hard time hearing you, move closer to them and speak more loudly.
If the person seems to get confused easily, use shorter sentences and be patient as you get your point across.
If they have memory loss, avoid asking too many questions at once. Also, avoid "why" questions, which may frustrate them. , Talk to them like you would any other adult. If they show no signs of confusion, there’s no need to simplify your vocabulary or over-explain things to them.Many older people feel insulted when others talk to them as if they are children, even if those people don’t mean any harm.
 Give the elderly person your full attention, even if they ramble. Make sure you’re understanding them by asking questions related to what they are saying. Don’t look around the room or check your watch while the other person is talking, since that will make you seem bored.For instance, if the person mentions living in another country, you could ask them to tell you more about that part of their life.
 Elderly people were once your age, and they’ve experienced the same feelings and many of the same life events as you. Treat the person with the same respect and courtesy you would expect from others, and look for common ground that will help you connect with each other.Think about how you want people to talk to you someday when you are elderly, and use that as a guideline for yourself.

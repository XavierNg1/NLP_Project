 You should start looking for homes for the litter before they are even born. Not only will this give you time to screen potential adopters but it can also help you find a new home for a puppy if an adopter backs out. If the puppies have already been born, you should start looking for homes immediately., If the puppies are purebred, you should contact the breeding club that the dog is registered with. This can be a national kennel club, such as the American Kennel Club or the United Kennel Club, or this might be a breed-specific club. Breeding clubs can help you find experienced owners. They can also provide references for potential adopters who have owned the breed before.You should look into registering the puppies with their breeding club as soon as possible. This can help you find good homes for the puppies as registered puppies may be more attractive to certain adopters.
 If the puppies have already been born, you can try positing individual profiles for each puppy on an adoption website. Here you can list the puppyâ€™s temperament, age, breed, and other details. You should post a picture of the puppy as well. Potential adopters will contact you through the site.Some good adoption websites include:


Petfinder
All Paws

, Word of mouth is a powerful tool. Start telling your friends and family that you will have a litter of puppies to adopt out. Ask them if they know of anyone who wants to adopt a puppy.You can even post on your social media pages that you have puppies who need homes.

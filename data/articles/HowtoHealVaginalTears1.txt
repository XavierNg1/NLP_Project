 There are four types of tears that you may get when you have a child. First degree tears are thin tears of the skin. Second degree tears are tears that involve the skin and muscle. These are the least serious types of tears.Third degree tears go down through the perineal muscles and into the anal canal. Fourth degree tears go into the anal canal and rectum.;
, Any vaginal tear from childbirth needs stitches. The doctor will place minor stitches along the tear for first and second tears. Third and fourth degree tears need more involved stitching. Each layer of skin and muscle needs to be sewed separately.For third and fourth degree tears, the doctor will focus on stitching together the muscles that support the anus and rectum.
 No matter the degree of the tear, you should keep the area clean. This can help reduce bacteria and help prevent infection. Wash your vaginal and perineal area multiple times each day.Pat the area dry with a clean towel. Make sure to dry from the front to the back so you don't get bacteria from the rectum in your vagina.
 Make sure to change the dressing or sanitary pads every four to six hours. This helps to keep the wound clean and reduces the risk of bacteria.

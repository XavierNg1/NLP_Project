 Rest the bottom of the cupcake in the palm of your non-dominant hand. Keep your hand steady so that the cupcake does not topple over.


Note that this method can also be referred to as the “gentleman style” or “hamburger style.” It is a convenient and relatively mess-free alternative that creates an even ration of frosting to cake.
This method works with any standard cupcake but does not work well with filled cupcakes.;
, Grip the center of the cupcake from the bottom using your dominant hand. Dig into the cupcake with your fingernails, twisting it gently simultaneously. Continue until the bottom breaks free from the top.


Note that it may be easier for you to use a knife to cut the cupcake in half. This can be done by placing the cupcake on a plate and sawing the top from the bottom with a knife. A plastic knife or other dull kitchen knife will work sufficiently well.
 Turn the bottom half of the cupcake upside-down so that the cut portion now faces downward. Place the bottom half over the top half and press it down into the frosting. Press well to secure the two halves together, using the frosting as an adhesive.
 Eat the cupcake by biting into as you would do with a sandwich or hamburger.


Watch out for any stray frosting. If your press too tightly as you eat, frosting may squirt out from in between the two cake layers.

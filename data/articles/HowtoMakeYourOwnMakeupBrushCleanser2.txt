 Add ½ cup (118 ml) of witch hazel, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of liquid castile soap, 1 cup (237 ml) of distilled water, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of nourishing oil, such as olive, jojoba, or almond, in a mason jar or other container. Put a lid on the container, and shake it well to thoroughly mix all of the ingredients.The witch hazel in the cleaner is antibacterial so it kills any germs on your brushes. The castile soap removes makeup residue and other dirt. The oil also helps break down makeup and helps condition the brushes too.
Because the oil may separate from the other ingredients, always shake the cleaner before using it.
 When you’re ready to clean your brushes, pour some of the cleaner into a small bowl or cup. Place the brushes in the cleaner, and let them soak for 5 to 10 minutes.If you prefer, you can put the cleaner in a spray bottle, spray some on the brushes, and then rub the bristles over a towel.
 After the brushes have soaked for several minutes, remove them from the cleaner. Run them under lukewarm water in the sink to rinse them, and carefully shape the wet bristles with your fingers. Set the brushes out on a counter or table to air dry.Be sure not to dry the brushes with the bristles up in the air. Water can drip back into the brushes’ ferrule, which can cause bristles to fall out.

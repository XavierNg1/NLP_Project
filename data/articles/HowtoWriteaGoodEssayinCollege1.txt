 Ask questions during class to find out if there are any off limits sources. Write down any outlines you were given by the professor, as well as recommendations about what sources are acceptable by that professor.


Know that the sources allowed by one professor may not be allowed by another, so be careful. Treat every class as a unique course with unique demands.





;
, Established sources include university publications, research journals, etc. Try not to get too lost in off-topic research. When researching for an essay, you do not need to get drawn well off topic into material that you can't use. Be aware of where the material you are reading is from, as it may be material that sounds perfectly valid, but has no basis in provable fact, or could be from a source that isn't considered valid by the professor.
 This gives you a good amount of material to pull snippets of fact from to better defend your point.

 If you need to stay home during a disaster, like a hurricane or tornado, you should prepare a safe space in your house for all of your family members to gather. This includes your pets. In most emergency situations, you should choose a location that is in the most central part of your home, away from any windows that could break and harm you. You should also go underground if possible – if you have a storm shelter or basement.If you can’t go underground, try to bring a heavy mattress down to your safe room that you can huddle under.
 Think about the things that you may need once the disaster is over and put those in the safe room. You should bring some lanterns and flashlights – all with fresh batteries. You should also pack some bottled water and food supplies. Additionally, bring all of the things that your cat will need to survive, such as cat food, medication, leash, and collar.Ideally, you can just grab your cat’s emergency supply kit and bring it with you to the safe location.
 When it’s time for your family to go to the safe location in your home, it’s also time to bring your cat to the safe spot. Put your cat in its pet carrier and take it with you to your chosen place.

Never just try to hold your cat during an emergency situation. You can pet the cat inside the carrier to soothe it, but you need to keep the cat inside the carrier so it doesn’t escape outside in case a window breaks.
 If your home is damaged in a disaster and your cat has escaped outside, you need to go look for the cat as soon as it is safe for you to do so. Once the danger has passed, go outside and begin searching the perimeter of your home. It is likely that your cat stayed nearby.Bring some treats with you so that your cat can smell its favorite food.
Call your kitty’s name gently around your home so that your cat can respond to your voice.
Try looking in nooks and crannies of any rubble that may be around outside. Cats like small tight spaces that make them feel more secure.

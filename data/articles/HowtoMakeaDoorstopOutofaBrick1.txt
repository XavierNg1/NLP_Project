 If you don’t have any lying around the house, you can look for them in a building reuse shop. Rinse a brick and leave it to dry.


If you have a very heavy door, you may want to use two bricks for this project.;
, You can use one color or several colors for a more intricate felted pattern.
 Start pulling out tiny wisps of roving in one or several colors. Lay them across the towel in one direction.









A single layer of wisps should cover the entire surface area of your brick.
The wisps should be small, but you can layer as many to get a uniform surface.
 Once you have a thick bed of wool roving on your towel, lay the brick in the center and carefully wrap the layers around it. They should meet on the other side.
 Pat them down so that they affix to the other layers of wool.
 Sprinkle a dash of hot water.
 Rub the surface very gently. Do this for several minutes.
 A skin will start to form and the wool will compact.
 Add drops of soap and sprinkles of hot water when the felting seems to have stalled.









If the wool starts to detach, you’ve used too much water.
If the suds stop you from seeing what you are doing, there’s too much soap. #*Remove soap or water with an extra towel.
 Repeat the process. When the felt is secured to the brick’s surface, you are done.
 If the wool detaches, you will need to go back to the soap and water felting process.
 It will tighten as it dries. Place in front of your door when it is completely dry.

, Right-click and open up the properties window. In the target box where it reads "C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo III\Diablo III Launcher.exe", edit this to read "C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo III\Diablo III.exe" -launch.
 Again edit the target to end with \Diablo III.exe" -launch (depending on where you duplicated the file it may read something like "C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo III Softxpand\Diablo III.exe" -launch)

, Then go back to the main account.
 This requires a monitor, keyboard, mouse and headphones (with usb audio adaptor if your soundcard does not support more than a single audio line out). Importantly, ensure it all works before proceeding.
 This time go to Appearance and Personalization, and under Display click on "Adjust Screen Resolution". Set the monitors to "Extend display".
 Download and install Softxpand Duo 2011. This will manage the screens/keyboards/mice/audio for each 'game station'.


After the software is successfully installed, the computer will require a restart.
Softxpand will prompt you to assign input devices for each station.

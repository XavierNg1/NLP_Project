 A small lamp will leave room for a few accessories on a small nightstand. It will also create a sense of balance with the nightstand's overall surface area. Lamps that are too wide or tall could end up dwarfing a small space and leave little to no room for accessories., This is especially helpful if you have limited space and lots of necessities that you must have on the nightstand. A wall sconce will free up space for your alarm clock, reading glasses, book, watch, and other objects. It will also allow you to add some decorative accessories around the things you need within reach when you wake up or turn in for the night., This is a good idea if you're a minimalist but don't want your nightstand to look too Spartan. This will allow you to add a small number of accessories without cluttering the surface. It will also nicely complement a wide or large nightstand., If you already have a unique artwork on the wall above the nightstand, you don't want to obscure it with a tall lamp. Aim for a shorter lamp whose light hits the bottom two-thirds of the painting. On the other hand, if you have a tall sculpture or flower vase that you'd rather not move, you should opt for a tall lamp for a balanced sense of height.

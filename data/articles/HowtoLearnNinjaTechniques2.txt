 This is one of the techniques of Shinobi Aruki. It is very useful for moving across creaky floor boards and the like. Start in a low crouching position with your arms extended for balance. Put most of your weight on the front leg. Move the back leg from the rear and swing it close to your other leg so it barely touches at the ankles.Extend the moving leg forward and use it to feel for any creaky floor boards. Then starting from the outer edge of your foot, ease your weight onto that leg.
 This is a walking technique used to travel along walls and through tight spaces. Yoko aruki starts with one's back against the wall. Move the rear leg in the direction of travel. Bend the knees deeply when doing this. Once in this position, move the other leg sideways in front of the other leg and in the direction of travel. This movement should be smooth., This is a good technique for walking through high brush or water. First, lift your front leg straight out of the brush. Slide your foot over the spot in which you intend to step. Point your foot straight down and step into the brush. After the foot has reached the ground return it to a normal position., Perhaps the best way to move about, crouching allows less of you to be seen while moving.
 Excellent for visual concealment, the crawl is good for crossing soft grass and clean surfaces. The crawl is not good for crossing anything noisy such as hard grass, leaves, and rocky terrain.
 When you're about to turn around a corner, listen for footsteps or talking around or behind a wall. If you're skilled enough, you can tell which direction they are facing by listening to them. Be sure to press your weight against the wall, and crouch as low as you can to peer around the corner.


The lower you are, the less chance they'll see you.
When ascending stairs, if they are creaky, walk on the side of them, closest to the wall.

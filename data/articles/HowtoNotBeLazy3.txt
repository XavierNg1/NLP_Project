 Don't hit the snooze on your alarm or go back to sleep but get right out of bed to start your day on the move. You are more likely to get and stay energized by starting your day out active.This can take practice to make it a habit. Try placing your alarm clock out of arm's reach. This will insure that you need to actually physically get out of bed before hitting the snooze.
 You are more likely to start your day out groggily if you are sleep deprived. This can also hurt your motivation and your ability to not be lazy the following day. Get plenty of rest to make sure you're at your best when you get up in the morning, feeling rested, rejuvenated, and ready to start your day!


Everyone needs different amounts of sleep to function their best but shoot for at least six or seven hours. Put away all electronics and screens when you're winding down for bed. Try to get as comfortable as possible and block out any possible distractions that will keep your mind moving.
 Exercise first thing in the morning. This will help your energy level remain high and take advantage of peak hormone times. Exercise is also proven to help concentration and focus for the rest of the day.Don't skip breakfast. Breakfast has physiological benefits, but also mental and mood improving effects. Eating a healthy breakfast will help your energy level stay up, your brain function peak, and even improves memory and concentration.

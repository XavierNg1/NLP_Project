 To have full custody and visitation rights, the father of the child must be legally recognized as the child's parent. If a man is married to a child's mother when the child is born, the man is presumed to be the child's father. The other ways to establish paternity are a Voluntary Acknowledgment of Paternity or a court order. Acknowledgment of Paternity forms are given to the mother in the hospital at the time the baby is born and must be signed before a hospital witness.To get a court order establishing paternity, contact the Oregon Child Support Services Program and ask how you can file an Application for Support Enforcement Services.You can contact the Oregon Child Support Services Program office by calling one of the phone numbers listed at http://www.oregonchildsupport.gov/offices/pages/index.aspx.

Most facilitators offer document review services, either for walk-ins or by appointment.You can find detailed information for facilitator services in each county at http://courts.oregon.gov/OJD/docs/OSCA/cpsd/courtimprovement/familylaw/FacilitatorsList.pdf.

 Make copies of your forms and take them to the court clerk. The clerk will stamp the original and the copies as "filed" and retain the original document. Filing your forms initiates a court case. The clerk will contact you to give you a hearing date. The filing fee is $252.00.If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, ask the court clerk for information about filing an application for a fee waiver.
 You will need to have copies of your forms delivered by the sheriff, a professional process server, or someone over 18 and not involved in the case.Have that person complete and sign a "Declaration of Service" form, which is available at http://courts.oregon.gov/Washington/docs/familylaw/3a_unmarried_petition/affidavitofservice-3a.pdf, and file the form with the court.


If you cannot locate the other parent to serve him or her, check with friends, family, employers, former landlords, the tax collector's records, the DMV, and the post office. You can even hire a private investigator.If all else fails, ask the court clerk how to request permission from the court to give "constructive notice" by publishing notice of the case in the newspaper.
 At the hearing, the judge will ask you to answer any questions he or she has about the request you have submitted. The other parent will have the opportunity to state why he or she might object to you having custody. Try to anticipate these arguments and figure out in advance how you want to respond.

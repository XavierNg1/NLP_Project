 If your bike is in use for a commuter item, a basket is both adorable and useful. Bike baskets range in material from wicker to wood or plastic, and come in many different sizes.The frequency with which you use your bike will help determine what basket you need to purchase, as some are affixed with delicate materials such as leather.
 Altering your bike seat can provide a fresh look and a bit more comfort for your rear end. Leather seats lend a vintage look to your bike, while gel-pad seats add a massive comfort factor., Colored wheels, spokes, shocks, and handlebars can all help decorate your bike. You can even have different colors for all of your bikeâ€™s components for a rainbow effect., You can change the shape of your handlebars altogether, or you can use tape, crepe, or paint to change the general appearance of your handlebars.If you do alter your handlebars, make sure you do not do anything to interfere with the brakes.
 Finally, add a delightfully child-like flair to your bike by adding streamers to your handle grips.Streamers can be created with old plastic bags, strips of fabric, or even old pom poms.
Commercial streamers come with small clips that are inserted into the ends of your bar grips. If you make your own streamers, you can fashion your own clips to attach them using supplies from a craft or hobby store.

 Instructions for use may vary by brand and product type, so it is important to read and follow the instructions. Make sure that you read the package instructions before using TUCKS® and use the product as instructed., After you have cleaned your anal area using a Sitz bath or washcloth, use one TUCKS® medicated pad to gently wipe the anal area. It is important to be gentle as you wipe the hemorrhoid.


Do not rub the area too hard or you may irritate the hemorrhoid.
Do not push the wipe into the rectum. Only use the pad on the outer part of your anus and anal region., After you have finished using the pad, throw it in the garbage or flush it down the toilet. TUCKS® pads are biodegradable, so it is okay to flush them down the toilet.Do not reuse the pads.
 For best results, you should use TUCKS® pads six times per day. If you have another bowel movement during the day, repeat the cleaning and medicating process. Remember to clean the area gently.
 By keeping the area clean and using TUCKS® pads, you should notice some improvement to your hemorrhoids within a few days days. If there is no improvement, then call your physician.

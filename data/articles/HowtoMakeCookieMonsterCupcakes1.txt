 Use your favorite cupcake recipe and bake as many as you'd like to decorate as Cookie Monster. You could make vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, or a combination of these. Ensure that you let your cupcakes cool completely on a wire rack before frosting or decorating them.


If you frost cupcakes while they're still warm, the cupcakes will absorb the frosting or it may just slide right off.;
, Place a medium-sized pastry bag into a tall glass and fold the ends over the sides of the glass. This will secure the pastry bag. Take a spoon and fill the piping bag with the blue frosting or buttercream. Cut the tip of the piping bag so you make a small hole in the end.You could also attach a pastry tip onto your piping bag. This would give your piped fur or frosting a unique design. Consider using a multi-opening tip to give the appearance of fur.
 Hold the bulk of the filled pastry bag with your dominant hand. Use your other hand to hold the pastry bag near the tip. Gently squeeze the blue frosting all over the top of the cupcakes. You should be making a squiggly motion so the frosting comes out in a thin drizzle.Try to make each cupcake look a little messy so the frosting looks like fur. You should cover the entire top of each cupcake with the blue frosting.
 Place two white chocolate buttons on each cupcake for the eyes. Take your tube of black icing and squeeze little circles on the buttons to make the pupils. You should also use the tube to squeeze a mouth onto each cupcake.You can make the pupils uneven so it looks like Cookie Monster has crazy eyes.
 Break one chocolate chip cookie and stick one half directly onto each mouth. The chocolate chip cookie should be sticking out a little so that it looks like the Cookie Monster is eating it.You could also use a chocolate sandwich cookie instead of chocolate chip.

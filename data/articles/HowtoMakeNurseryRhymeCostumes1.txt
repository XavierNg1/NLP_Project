 Choose a pastel or white dress that has a bigger skirt. The dress for this costume can vary greatly, but look for something in a classic style.;
, You can find bonnet patterns at craft stores, or you can check your local thrift shop or child's clothing store for a bonnet that matches the dress you've chosen.


To embellish your costume more, also keep an eye out for bloomers. These can go under the dress to make the costume look more old-fashioned.
, You can find a small hook at a garden store or a plastic candy cane yard decoration. Once you've found the item you will use as a staff, spray paint it white or the color of your child's dress.


Tie ribbons and flowers around the staff. Your child will love carrying flowing ribbons.
 If you don't have bloomers, add a pair of tights and some Mary Jane shoes. Give her the staff and lamb to carry.

 Bringing a new, younger cat or dog into your home is an excellent way to keep your cat’s mind active. Experts say that introducing a young animal into your home works to “turn back the clock” for older cats.If the new pet is another cat, you’ll want the new cat to be:


Younger.
Smaller.
The opposite gender.
Fixed.
 You can provide visual stimulation for your cat by creating “kitty TV.” Place bird feeders and/or bird baths outside your window where your cat can get a good view. This entertains your cat and provides excellent mental stimulation., Set up cat trees, paper bags, cardboard boxes, scratching posts, and anything else your cat might enjoy to create a interesting landscape for your cat to explore. Try doing this once a week as a special treat for your cat.

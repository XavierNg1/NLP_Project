, Vital points are places around your body that are not naturally protected by muscle, making them the best places to aim for. Vital points run through your center line- which runs from top to bottom of your body. See "Tips" for more.
 This gives you a good, solid base to launch effective attacks from.
 If it means that your opponent isn't going to recover in order to keep yourself safe, then by all means do it.
 If you have made every attempt to avoid the confrontation, you can reasonably assume that any sudden movement on the part of your opponent is the start of an attack. The moment he initiates his attack, attack him. In all likelihood, he has initiated with the thought that he will simply drop you. So when you beat him to the punch (literally), he will be caught by surprise, and give you an opening to catch him with a follow through.
 Say your opponent throws a right punch at your face and you block/dodge it, think about what is easy to get at, in this case, assuming you blocked with your left hand, his/her stomach, solar plexus, throat, groin and eyes will all be open to you. All you need is one scoring shot and he/she's going down.
 If your opponent is punching you, that would usually mean that he/she is lunging forward. Grab their arm with one hand and pull them into your attacking free hand.
 If you are able to smash your opponent against a wall, tree, rail, or the ground, and you must do so to end the fight, then there's another option. Try to remember, though, that self-defense only goes so far.

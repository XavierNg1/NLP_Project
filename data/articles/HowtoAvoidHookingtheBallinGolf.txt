 Make sure your right hand grips the club correctly. You should put it on the club from exactly the same position as when your arm hangs free from your shoulder. Make sure your wrist is straight, so your hand does not bend beneath the club, and put your left thumb straight into the groove of your right hand. If you grip correctly, your right thumb will point straight at your right shoulder. See the VideoJug video 'the grip' to find out how to make a perfect grip.;
, Make sure you set up with your weight on the balls of your feet. Keep your weight on the balls of your feet during the backswing, and your upper body at a constant angle throughout the swing. This allows you to swing the club freely in front of your body, so it is easy to follow through. If your balance and upper body position are good, you will finish your follow through with your right shoulder below your left.
 The action in the swing is just like any other in which you want to direct power forwards, throwing a ball, playing tennis or throwing a javelin. On your down swing, you should start turning from your legs, and let the rotation travel up your body. The earlier the lower body rotates through the ball, the later the club gets to the ball. This reduces the chance of the clubface closing before impact and curving the ball to the left. So a good grip, set-up, and swing help you to avoid unwanted hooks, letting you hit the ball true for a straighter shot.

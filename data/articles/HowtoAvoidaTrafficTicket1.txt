 Don’t break traffic laws, and you won’t get ticketed. Ignorance is no excuse. Traffic laws also vary from state to state and even from town to town, so do some research if you’re driving away from home.;
, Aggressive or erratic driving can irritate other drivers and put both of you in danger. Even if you’re not breaking any laws, weaving in and out of lanes and stopping or accelerating quickly can bring you unwanted attention from police. Consider taking a defensive driving course.
 It's the law pretty much everywhere, and an iron-clad excuse for a sharp-eyed officer to pull you over.

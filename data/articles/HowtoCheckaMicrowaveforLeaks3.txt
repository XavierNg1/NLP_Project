 Microwave leaks are often the result of worn or broken elements on the microwave oven's door. If you have detected a leak, look for these common causes:


Cracks on the hinges
Worn areas or cracks on the seal
Dents or breaks in the door itself
Broken door hinges or door that fails to close firmly
Damage to the metal mesh of the door (especially holes wider than 4.7 in / 12 cm)
Broken door latch that does not immediately turn off the oven when you open the door., An electronics repair shop has access to much more accurate microwave testing equipment. Its staff can confirm whether your microwave is safe, and identify the problem in need of repair.


You may be able to convince a repair shop to rent you the testing equipment for a smaller fee.However, these devices do require calibration and training to use, so hiring a professional may give more accurate results.
 If your microwave is leaking, especially if it is new and undamaged, consider contacting the manufacturer. In the United States, all manufacturers are required to pass on your report to the FDA.You can also report it to the FDA directly at this form.


Outside of the US, report the issue to consumer safety organizations or government health departments.
 Microwave radiation is the same kind of "radiation" as visible light and radio waves, not the ionizing radiation that can cause cancer or radioactivity. The only known risk of a leaking microwave is the high levels of heat it produces. This is most dangerous to the eye (where it can lead to cataracts) and the testes (where it can cause temporary sterility).Extreme levels of microwave radiation can cause skin burns. If you do not notice any symptoms and you stop using the leaking microwave, lasting damage is very unlikely.

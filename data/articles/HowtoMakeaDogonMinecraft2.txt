 Taiga biomes are largely populated by spruce trees and The grass there is a dull green, and there may or may not be snow there. Forest biomes are populated by oak and birch trees and flowers. The grass is bright green and it's one of the most common biomes. Wolves very rarely spawn outside of the Taiga and Forest biomes. When they do, it's usually a glitch or bug.
 You must be on Easy, Normal, or Hard difficulty for this. You can seek out some skeletons in caves or at night. You could also hide away all night long (without sleeping) and go out in the morning; you will likely find arrows and bones dropped by skeletons who died in the sun.
 Once you have at least eight bones, search the Taiga for a wolf. Normally they spawn in groups.


Turn on your volume to listen for barking.
If you find raw mutton and/or blocks of wool in a Taiga biome, there are likely wolves in the area; they attack and kill any sheep near them.
 Once you've found a wolf, take out your bones and left-click the wolf until it is tame. Once tamed it will be sitting, its eyes larger and a red collar around its neck.

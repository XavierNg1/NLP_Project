 Loose buildup can make your flask seem dirtier than it actually is. Pour a moderate amount of clean water into the vacuum flask. Cap the flask and shake it firmly. Remove the cap and pour the water down the drain.
 Fill the flask with a moderate amount of clean water. Add a few drops of dish soap to the water. Cap the flask and shake it well to clean it. Open the flask and inspect its condition. If there is stubborn buildup, you may need to scrub it away.If the water has become dirty, dump it down the drain. Rinse the flask and refill it with clean water and a few drops of dish soap.
For severely dirty flasks, allow the soapy water to sit for a few minutes. This will allow more time for the soap to break up buildup.
 To remove stubborn buildup from the inside of flasks, you may need a scrubbing tool. Because some vacuum flasks may have narrow top openings, small, long handled scrubbers or toothbrushes may work best.

Specialty bottle brushes are available at most grocery stores and drug stores. Look for these in the “baby” or “infant” section of the store.If you don’t have a suitable handled scrubber, wrap or tie a washcloth to a wooden spoon. Scrub the insides of the flask with the cloth wrapped spoon.
 When the inside of the flask looks clean, pour the cleaning solution down the drain. Rinse the flask to remove soap and loosened buildup. Allow the flask to air dry completely before storing it.

Storing a vacuum flask while still wet or capped could cause it to smell musty. To remove mustiness, use the process described for deodorizing and cleaning with baking soda and vinegar.

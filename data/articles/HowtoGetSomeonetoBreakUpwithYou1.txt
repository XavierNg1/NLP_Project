 Don’t pick up their calls or answer their texts, and ignore them if they ask to spend time with you. This sort of physically distancing from your partner will likely indicate to them that something is wrong in the relationship.


Keep in mind this will likely also cause more drama and anger from your partner, which may then lead to angry voicemails and “surprise” visits that could get ugly.;
, This is one way you can deflect blame from your actions to the actions of your partner, and hurt them enough that they will consider ending the relationship.


Keep in mind this method can lead to a permanent break between you and your partner, and will likely put you in a bad light in their eyes.
 This is another avoidance tactic that will likely hurt and upset your partner so much, they may end your relationship.


Be aware that flirting and/or cheating will involve individuals outside your relationship and could make the situation even more complicated and stressful as you are now dealing with the feelings of two “partners” rather than just one.
This is also a very destructive and drastic way to get someone to break up with you.

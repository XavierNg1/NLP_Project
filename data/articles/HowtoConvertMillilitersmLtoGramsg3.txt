 As described above, density is mass per unit volume. If you are answering a math or chemistry problem, it may tell you what the substance's density is. Otherwise, search for the substance's density online or on a chart.


Use this chart to look up the density of any pure element. (Note that 1 cm3 = 1 milliliter.)
Use this document to look up the density of many foods and beverages. For items that only have a "specific gravity" listed, that number equals the density in g/mL at 4ºC (39ºF), and will typically be reasonably close for substances at roughly room temperature.
For other substances, type the name of the substance and "density" into a search engine.
 Sometimes, the density is given in units other than g/mL. If the density is written in g/cm3, no changes are necessary, since a cm3 is exactly equal to 1 mL. For other units, try an online density conversion calculator, or do the math yourself:


Multiply the density in kg/m3 (kilograms per cubic meter) by 0.001 to get the density in g/mL.
Multiply the density in lb/gallon (pounds per U.S. gallon) by 0.120 to get the density in g/mL.
 Multiply the mL measurement of your substance by its density in g/mL. This gives you an answer in (g x mL) / mL, but you can cancel the mL units at the top and bottom and end up with just g, or grams.


For example, to convert 10 mL of ethanol to grams, look up the density of ethanol: 0.789 g/mL.Multiply 10 mL by 0.789 g/ml, and get 7.89 grams. Now you know that 10 milliliters of ethanol weighs 7.89 grams.

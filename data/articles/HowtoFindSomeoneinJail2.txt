 The Federal Bureau of Prisons maintains a database of all federal inmates incarcerated from 1982 to the present.If the person you're looking for was incarcerated prior to 1982, the online inmate locator may not have any record of him or her. To find those records, you must contact the National Archives Records Administration rather than the BOP.While the BOP occasionally houses some inmates convicted of state crimes or those convicted of felonies in the District of Columbia, the records primarily are of those convicted of federal crimes in a federal court., You can search either by the inmate's BOP Register Number or by name.Searching by BOP Register Number is the most efficient way to find someone in federal prison, but you typically won't know this information the first time you search.
The BOP inmate locator searches by first and last name, but also includes fields for race, age, and sex that you can fill in to narrow your search results., Depending on how much you narrowed your search, you may have to sift through several listings to find the right person.


Each listing will include the inmate's name, BOP Register Number, age, sex, race, and release date or prison location. Clicking on the prison name will take you to that prison's website, where you can find an address or contact information for the prison itself.

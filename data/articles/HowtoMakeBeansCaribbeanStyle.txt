, You can use canned beans; however, you won't get the same taste results and cooking the beans from package is healthier than canned beans. There are various methods to softening the beans. You can place the beans in water overnight, you can boil the beans for at least 1-2 hours, or the fastest and best way, using a pressure pot, which is faster and only takes 30-40 mins.
 Begin by dicing the onions into very small parts. You can also use a food processor, just drop in the onions without any water. Take the garlic and chop it finely or mash it. In the pot, add some cooking oil, enough to cover the surface of the pot. Put the onions and let it sizzle. Do not put the garlic until the onions have cooked.
 If the fire is high, lower it to medium-low. When you begin to smell the garlic, take the tomato sauce and begin to mix well and quickly. After the smell of the mixture begins to rise, drop the soften beans inside the pot and slowly stir and continue dropping more beans. The water that was produced by the beans, pour inside as well. Slowly stir.
 Mix well, and taste to make sure it tastes awesome. Let it boil.
 You can add one or two bell peppers inside. If you like, you can chop these finely; however, if you add them whole, with the heat they will soften and can be easily taken out. Mix well and let it boil, on medium-low fire.
 This gives the beans a thicker consistency and makes it taste great.
 After this take out the veggies if you like and simply serve. Enjoy!

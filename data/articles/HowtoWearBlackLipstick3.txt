 Black lipstick is a natural fit with dark jewel-toned clothes that you start to reach for in late fall and throughout the winter. It looks great with sapphire blue, ruby red, emerald green and dark fuschia. Try black lipstick with one of these looks:A dark blue velvet dress with black lace trim.
A green silk blouse paired with a black pencil skirt.
A ruby red coat and black riding boots.
 Black lipstick doesn't have to be relegated to the winter months; it looks fabulous in the summer as well. Black looks particularly striking when paired with bright neon shades; the contrast is truly eye-catching. If you like neon, try one of the following looks paired with black lipstick:


A neon yellow sheath dress and black strappy heels.
Hot pink sunglasses and a wispy black dress.
A neon patterned boho dress with jet black accessories.
 It can be fun to thwart people's expectations by pairing black lipstick with a traditional outfit that would normally be seen with a tame pink lip gloss. If you have a playful sense of humor and are looking for a way to take your prim and proper outfits up a notch, try pairing black lipstick with one of these looks:


A soft, sky-blue sweater and a white tennis skirt.
A white button-up blouse and a pair of preppy jeans.
A pink sundress and black flats.
 Why not go all out? Use black lipstick as part of an overall style that says "look, but don't touch." If you love black, don't hold back: project your interesting personality by pairing black lipstick with one or more of the following:


A black dress, skirt, jacket, or black jeans.
Black fishnets and boots.
Black and red or black and pink plaid patterns.
Dyed black hair, black nail polish, etc.

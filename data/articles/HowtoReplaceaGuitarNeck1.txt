Older flattop acoustic guitars often need their necks reset. Fortunately, this repair does not require a new guitar neck. Unfortunately, attempting to reset a guitar neck without proper training in this type of repair can result in significant damage to the instrument.
You will know your guitar neck needs to be reset if you’re experiencing high string action that you can’t fix with adjustments to the saddle or adjustment rods.;

Bolt-in or bolt-on guitar necks can be replaced fairly easily. A glued guitar neck will likely require a professional to perform the replacement because he can evaluate the type of glue and use the proper steaming or heating method to remove the neck.



When ordering a new neck, make sure it works with your guitar. This may require a phone call to both the manufacturer of the neck and the guitar manufacturer. A loose fit will negatively affect your guitar’s tone.
 You’ll need to restring the guitar after replacing the neck.

Some guitar necks will be wedged into their pockets so tightly, this process can be arduous. Be patient and continue wiggling the neck until it becomes loose enough to pull out of the pocket. Being too rough can chip the pocket.
 If the neck is too wide, use sandpaper or a dremel tool to widen the pocket. Do not force it in.


If you’re not confident in your abilities to shape the guitar’s pocket, it’s time to take the guitar into a repair shop. Removing too much of the pocket’s body can destroy the instrument.
Measure both the neck and the pocket before you begin sanding so you know exactly how much to remove.

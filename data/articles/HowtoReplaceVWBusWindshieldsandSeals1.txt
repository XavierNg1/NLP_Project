Most shops can get it for you new, though not all of the new glass fits as well as original windshields, and it tends to be much more expensive.;
, If you are going to put the effort in, it's best to replace the seal as well.


The "Classic Cal" look (all black) is a good way to go. Many people think think it looks better, plus you don't have to fool with inserting the chrome trim into the rubber - a serious pain.
 Use a utility knife to slice off the outer edge of the seal, running a thin blade between the glass and the seal. Pull out the glass and chuck the old seal. As you cut away the old seal make sure not to let the window fall out.


Use this step as well if you are removing the glass yourself at the junkyard. Use duct tape to hold the glass to the car body by running 2 vertical pieces of duct tapes to the roof and the center of the glass. Should the glass "pop out" when you cut the last old seal you will have time to catch it.

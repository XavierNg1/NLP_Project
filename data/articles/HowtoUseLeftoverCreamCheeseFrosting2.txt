 Use a blender to puree 2 and a half cups of sliced strawberries. Then, mix in your leftover frosting. Freeze the mixture overnight and enjoy some fresh ice cream in the morning.This tends to work well with lemon frosting. If you have some lemon juice, add a splash of that to your mixture.
 If you have a mason jar, you can make a layered dip with leftover frosting. This can make a delicious snack to serve at parties.Use anything sweet you have in your kitchen to layer with the frosting.
You can, for example, spread a layer of cream cheese frosting, then a layer of bananas, followed by a layer of sprinkles, then chocolate dip, and then cherry pie filling.
You can dip items like graham crackers in your layered dip.

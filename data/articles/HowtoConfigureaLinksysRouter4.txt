 This section of the router configuration will allow you to set restrictions on internet access for any of the devices connected to the network. You can block all internet access at designated times, as well as block specific websites or keywords.
 In the “Enter policy name” filed, give your access policy a name that you can easily reference. You can switch between multiple policies by using the dropdown menu at the top of the page.
 Click the “Edit List of PCs” button, and then enter the IP addresses for the devices you want to enable the policy for. This is useful if you want the kids’ computer to not have access in the evening, or to limit employee access during the day.
 Use the Days and Times sections to set when you want internet blocked. As long as the policy is enabled, the selected devices will not be able to access the internet at all during these days and times.
 In the section below the schedule, you can enter specific websites that you want the router to block. Websites entered here will be inaccessible to anyone on the policy list. You can also block websites based on keywords contained within the websites, allowing you to block much more than single sites.
 Once you are finished configuring the policy, toggle the “Enabled” option and then click the “Save Settings” button at the bottom of the page. Your router will reset and your new policy will take effect.

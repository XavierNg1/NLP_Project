 This is the easiest and simplest way of hanging curtains.
 Flip the curtain so that the back is facing you. Cut 3Â½ inch (8.89 centimeters) long strips of 2 inch (5.08 centimeters) wide ribbon. Space the ribbons 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) apart. Glue the top of each ribbon strip to the top of the curtain. Glue the bottom of each ribbon 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) from the top of the curtain, creating a bulge. Slide the panels onto the curtain rod.Choose a ribbon color that matches your curtain color.
 Take the curtain rod off the wall, and attach the curtains. When you are done, place the rod back onto the wall. Position the panels to either side of the window, and tie them back with pieces of matching ribbon, if desired. If you have a very high ceiling, you may want to hang the curtains higher up, and pull them to the outer edges of the window (as opposed to the inner edges) instead.


If you are using curtain rings, clip them onto the top hem, and pass the curtain rod through the rings.
If you are using ribbon tabs, pass the curtain rod through the tabs.
If you are using just the hem, pass the curtain rod through the wide, top hem.

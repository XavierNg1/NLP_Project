 When you first introduce a snail to a new environment, it might be shy. The snail might pull its body into its shell for several days as it adjusts to its new environment. This behavior is a stress response, and is normal for a snail that transitions to a new habitat.


You should be alarmed if the snail is contained within its shell and you can see the “door” to its shell (the operculum) is open. This could indicate sickness or death.
 If you don’t have fish in your aquarium, you can feed your snail algae discs. These are small bits of algae that your snail can eat.


Algae discs are readily available online or at most pet stores.
Other foods your snail might enjoy include small bits of shredded lettuce or blanched veggies like zucchini squash.
The frequency you need to feed your snail depends on its species. Talk to your veterinarian with specific concerns about how often your snail needs to be fed.
 Check your filter each day to ensure it is operating properly. Once each week, remove 25% of your tank’s water, and replace it with new water.


For instance, if your tank holds eight gallons, once each week, you should remove two gallons, and add two gallons of new freshwater.
 If your snail dies or if you can no longer care for it, you should use care to dispose of it properly. The best option to get rid of a snail you can no longer care for is to sell it or give it to someone who can care for it. You should never release a pet snail into the wild. Some types of snails are considered pests and can disrupt the ecosystems they’re introduced to.If your snail dies, place it in two sealed plastic bags along with any eggs you might want to dispose of. Freeze the lot for at least 72 hours at a temperature at or below -20°Fahrenheit (-29°C).
Alternately, you can dispose of the snail with a medical or biohazard waste company.

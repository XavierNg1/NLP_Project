 People who cut themselves might be depressed, suffering from an anxiety disorder, or are suffering from a disorder that causes them to be self-destructive.;
, People often have emotions and problems they can't deal with, for example, rape, incest, abuse, prostitution, infliction of punishment over a long period of time, etc.
 Most people who try cutting will often do it again. They can be calling for help and just can't find the words to tell you that they do it. Cutting is a way to vent, and usually helps them calm down, so they'll do it again unless they can find another outlet.
 That is probably the worst thing you can do/say to a person that cuts. Calling them emo, overtly sensitive, stupid, etc., will just hurt them more and give them another reason to cut. Emo, stupid, over-sensitive, etc. are projections of your own inability to cope and they are labels; nobody likes to be labeled or misunderstood. When you label these people it just makes them feel worse, and makes it worse them to tell someone about them cutting, by them worrying that others will judge them too.
 If you are their friend they trust you and pestering them will only lower that trust, potentially losing you a friendship, and probably making the problem worse.

 Before you begin, think about what you will pray about. What are the things in your life that trouble you? What are you thankful for? How do you want to bring God into your life? What questions do you have? These are things which you may want to pray on. Knowing what to say ahead of time will make you feel more clear and comfortable when you go to pray.;
, After you've thought about some of the things you'd like to talk to God about, consult with your priest, imam, rabbi, or a friend or family member whom you trust. Ask them what they think God might be able to help you with and what they think about your concerns and questions. They may open your eyes to questions and answers which you had never thought of.
 Once you are ready to pray, you will need to find an appropriate place and time to pray to God. This should be a quiet place where you can devote a good amount of time and concentration to your conversation with God, to show him your devotion.


However, if you feel the need to pray quickly and in a less than ideal situation, go right ahead. You do not need to be anywhere special for God to hear you. He will understand your distress and cares only that you love him in your heart and try to follow him.
 You may want to have certain items when you pray, such as candles, a bible, the remains of a loved one, or other items which are significant to you. Have these available and respectfully placed.
 You will want to decide if you feel it is better to pray on your own or with others. Different faiths stress different methods but you should not feel constrained by the normal conventions of your denomination. Do what you feel is right in your heart, whether that means singing your prayers in a church full of people or facing Qibla alone in a corner.

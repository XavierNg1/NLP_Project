 Combine vinegar and water to make a cleaning solution. Wipe or spray it on the old marks. Next, wipe the board with a clean paper towel.








The ratio of vinegar to water should be 1 tsp (4.9 mL) vinegar to 8 oz. (236.5 mL) water.
 Add a small amount of water to baking soda. Rub the paste into the old marks on the board. Thoroughly wipe the paste off with a damp cloth or paper towel. This works well on marks made by permanent marker.
 Rub damp coffee grounds on the board. They are mildly abrasive and will remove the marks without damaging your board. Clean the board thoroughly after using the grounds. This will prevent the board from turning brownish., Massage margarine onto the board. You will notice that the margarine will slowly change to the color of the old marks. This shows it is working. Wipe the margarine away with paper towel.

Be sure to remove all of the margarine so it doesnâ€™t prevent writing on the board.
If the stain is more than a year old, put some plastic wrap over the margarine and wait 24 hours before wiping the board clean.
 Apply car wax to the marks in circular motions. Wipe the wax off with a clean cloth. This method is very good for removing the most stubborn stains. Car wax conditions the board and leaves the surface like-new.









Another good solution from the garage is WD-40. It also lubricates and conditions the board.

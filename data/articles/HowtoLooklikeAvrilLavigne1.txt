 These are the colors that she wears the most often. Avril usually wears denim and black t-shirts with punk skulls on them.
 They are easy to find and are a great accessory with Avril's look. Toms are okay too as long as they are black or white or hot pink.
 Avril wears a lot of bold jewelry, and remember, to save money, the jewelry doesn't have to be real silver, it can be silver-colored. Also, consider wearing hot pink & black chunky bracelets to show some attitude.

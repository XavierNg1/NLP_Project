 Jab in a sharp pair of scissors or make a cut with an x-acto knife to start. Scissors can then be used to cut around the can until the end is removed.
 Examine the remaining part of the can for the seam where the metal was welded together. Cut down the length of the seam until you can lay the aluminum flat.
 Consider the design you want the earring to be. Lay out the leftover piece of metal, then use a hole punch to make the shape. Keep the metal against a flat surface as you work. Simple shapes include butterflies and flowers.The hole punch dulls the edges, but use sandpaper or an emery board to file down any sharpness.
 Imagine how the shapes will hang as an earring. Where you put the hole for the chain determines this. Once youâ€™ve decided, use a pushpin to poke a small hole through the aluminum., A small length of chain or jump ring from the craft store are useful here. Use small pliers or tweezers to open one end of this connector, then push an end through the hole. Close the loop when you are done.
 Pull open the earring back, using pliers if necessary. Run the chain or jump ring through it, then close the loop. Your earrings will be ready to wear.


Chains, rings, and backs can be recycled from old jewelry you have around the house.

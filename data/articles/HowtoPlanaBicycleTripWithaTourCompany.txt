If renting, find out the cost and whether it includes a helmet.
If bringing your bike, plan how to transport it. If you are travelling on a plane, you'll need to pack it in a box. Know the rules for other modes of transportation, such as shuttles and trains, to get you to the tour starting point and back home.
If you are bringing your own bike, make sure it's equipped with a headlamp, taillight and rearview mirror. Bring extra batteries for the lights. You may also want a cyclometer to track the speed, average speed, distance traveled and total ride time.
Bring tools and spare parts for your bike as well as a lock to secure it. The bicycle tour company may provide some items, especially if renting.



Bring clothes for heat, cold, wind and rain.
Have water bottles, a hydration pack, plenty of energy snacks and a first aid kit.
Bring a GPS and detailed maps of the route if they aren't provided by the bicycle tour company.
Attach the necessary packs to your bike to hold your gear. You might want a handlebar bag with a clear pocket to easily view your map while biking. You may need a seat bag and front and rear panniers with rain covers to hold the rest of your gear.

 Niche perfume boutiques almost always sell sample vials of their scents through their online stores. Most of them will throw in one or two freebies with your order if you make a purchase.


Some of them even have sample programs you can sign up for, so that you’re automatically mailed their newest fragrances whenever they debut., Perfume outlets generally sell a wide range of perfume brands at a slightly discounted cost. Many of them have “try before you buy” offers so that you can buy and smell a variety of scents.There are also perfume sample businesses, which deal only in the sale of samples.
These are both excellent ways to get ahold of a wide range of perfume samples at an affordable price.
 You can find a decent selection of perfume samples that you can purchase through sellers on eBay. Occasionally you will find some really great deals on eBay and usually the prices are pretty good.eBay doesn’t allow the sale of decanted sample vials, so make sure that any product you order and receive is in its original packaging.
Also check any samples ordered through eBay for signs of having been opened and/or diluted. You can report these things and receive refunds in most cases.
 There are multiple online venues that provide a forum for people to swap perfume samples with one another.Each one works a little differently, so make sure you read the site carefully for information about their process before joining up.


Most of these sites allow swapping of more than just perfume samples – makeup, skin care, and many other beauty-related items are swapped, as well.
Swapping prescription medication is not allowed on these sites.
Be aware that most of them forbid any buying or selling through their site. Strictly swapping only.

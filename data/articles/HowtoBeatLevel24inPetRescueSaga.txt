 If you really want to start strong, use some boosters. On the pre-game screen, select the boosters you’d want to equip for the game.


You may have to shell some gold bars if you don’t have a particular booster you want to use.;
, Once you’re in, analyze how your board is laid out. Locate the pets. Look for long connected blocks of the same color for huge points.
 You won’t know how your board will look like after several moves as new blocks will have come into play. However, you have control over your first few moves. Plan them out properly to get huge points.
 This isn’t a time-limited level, so you don’t have to hurry. Take a good look of the whole board before each move., If you’re able to clear long connected blocks of the same color, you will get huge points. Strive for this in every move. Doing so will also recharge your rocket booster faster.
 If you can’t find the pets when you started this level, it’s because all of them are locked up in cages. Unlock the pets as soon as you have a chance so you can work on getting them down.


Unlocked pets will go up to the top of the column, so it will be a waste to get a caged pet to the bottom and have to bring them back down again after they’re freed.
 After several moves, balloons will come into play. Use the balloons to remove similar color blocks from the board. Use them wisely.
 The bombs are useful in clearing out certain blocks that just won’t go away. Reserve using the bombs when they’re near or at the bottom to get some pets to fall down, or when they’re near something you want to remove, like wired blocks and pet cages.


The bombs don’t hurt the pets, so go detonate some.
 When the rocket booster is all fired up, use it on a column that has some pets ready to fall or that has some blocks you’d like to clear out.


You don’t need to use it right away, but better use it still so it can start recharging again.

 Once you know exactly how you want your dog’s show ring gait improved, you will be able to take corrective action. The best way to improve your dog’s show ring gait is to sign it up for classes. Contact your local kennel club about enrolling your dog in classes to improve show ring gait. If they don’t offer classes, ask a club representative if they know of a local trainer or club that does offer classes.If you continue to struggle trying to find classes for your dog, check online or use your yellow pages to find an instructor.
 A clicker is a small device, available at most pet stores, to help your dog associate good behavior with a reward. However, it is not necessary to use a clicker manufactured for the specific purpose of dog training. You could instead use a whistle, a bell, or any other noisemaker. The important thing is to keep the clicker or clicker substitute consistent throughout training, otherwise your dog could be confused., It is easier to engage in clicker training if you give your dog a treat while another person utilizes the clicker, or vice versa. Ask a family member or friend to help you improve your dog’s show ring gait. Alternately, locate someone else who is also interested in improving their dog’s show ring gait. That way, you and the other person can take turns helping each other improve your dogs’ show ring gaits.With a partner, one of you can stand in a central position observing from a distance with a clicker, while the other one can walk along the dog holding its leash and administering treats when as needed.
If you don’t want to work with a partner, just hold the clicker in one hand and the treats in your other hand.

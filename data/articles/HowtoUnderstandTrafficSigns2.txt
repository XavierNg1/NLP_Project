 They tell drivers to come to a complete stop at the white line on the street. Drivers should look both ways to yield to pedestrians and oncoming traffic before proceeding.


Each stop sign comes with a label at the bottom that indicates how many cars at the intersection have a stop sign.

Two-way signs tell you that two cars do; you and the car traveling opposite you on the same street. You must both yield to all cars on the cross street.

Three-way signs are generally only present at intersections that have three streets, so they function in the same way as four-way and all-way stop signs. The car that arrives at the intersection first can leave first after coming to a complete stop. If two cars arrive at the same time, the one on the right has the right of way.;
, They tell drivers to slow down and to prepare to stop if there are vehicles or pedestrians in the intersection.


An alternate version of a yield sign is a white rectangle that reads "TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC."
Some yield signs specify stopping for pedestrians, or announce that there is a pedestrian crosswalk you must stop for.
 It's generally acceptable to go 5 miles (8.0Â km) above or below the speed limit, but anything beyond that can earn you a traffic ticket.
 They also indicate if lanes are reserved for certain vehicles (e.g., taxis, buses, trucks, etc.)

,, They also specify if certain vehicles are prohibited on a street (e.g., buses, bicycles, vehicles with lugs, trucks, or motor vehicles); these are generally white.
,, They indicate that railroad tracks are ahead, and drivers should prepare in case a train comes. This means not stopping in the middle of intersections and taking caution.

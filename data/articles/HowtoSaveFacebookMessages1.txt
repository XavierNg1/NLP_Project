 Right-click on the dialogue icon on the header menu bar, and open the link in a new tab or window. You will be brought to the Messages view page.
 The left panel contains your list of conversations. The messages here are sorted with the most recent conversations at the top. Each conversation is identified by the person or group you were in a conversation with. The last message date is also indicated beside each message.


Use the scroll bar on the left panel to scroll through your list of conversations. You can go back to years of conversations here. Everything is stored. When you reach the bottom of the current batch, the next batch of older messages will be loaded automatically, until you reach the very end or the very first conversation you’ve had on Facebook.
 When you find the conversation you want to extract, click on it from the left panel. The whole conversation thread will open on the right panel. You can see and read everything you talked about, from the very first time you started that particular thread with the same person or the same group.
 You may not need to copy everything from the beginning. You may just need a certain portion of it. Highlight the messages you want and copy them to your clipboard (CTRL+C for PC, CMD+C for Mac).
 Open any text editor, such as MS Word or Notepad. Paste (CTRL+V for PC, CMD+V for Mac) the contents of your clipboard. Note that some formatting and photos may be lost in the transfer.
 Once you’ve copied and pasted everything you need, save the file. You now can print or store the messages as needed.

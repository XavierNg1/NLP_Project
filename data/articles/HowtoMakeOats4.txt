 Place the oats, oat flour, salt, sugar, powdered creamer, and dried fruit into a plastic bag. Seal the bag and shake it well to combine the ingredients.If desired, you could prepare the dry mix ahead of time. Keep the oatmeal mixture in its sealed bag and store it at room temperature. Use it before the expiration date of the quickest-expiring ingredient.
If you plan to eat this oatmeal immediately, consider using freshly rolled oats or quick-cooking oats made from freshly rolled oats. The resulting oatmeal will have a deeper taste and more nutritional value.
The addition of oat flour will create thicker oatmeal. For thin oatmeal similar to the store-bought variety, you may omit this ingredient.
The powdered creamer and dried fruit are both optional.

Plain powdered creamer is better than powdered milk since it lasts longer.
Most dry berries can be used whole. Larger dried fruit should be chopped into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) pieces or smaller before you add them to the bag.
 Dump the dry oatmeal mixture into a microwave-safe serving bowl. Pour the milk into the bowl, as well, and stir until combined.

Milk creates creamier oatmeal, but if you want to cut calories, you could skip the milk and use an equivalent amount of water.
 Place the uncovered bowl in your microwave and cook it on full power for approximately 60 seconds.

Note that low-powered microwaves may require a slightly longer cooking time.
Allow the hot oatmeal to rest in your microwave for roughly 15 to 30 seconds before removing it.
 At this point, the oatmeal should be finished and ready to eat.

 If you want a slightly curlier wave, you can use your flat iron to create this effect. It's similar to the above process. However, you hold the flat iron at a vertical angle and curl all the way down your locks.


Bend the hair vertically as you iron. Place about a one inch section of hair in the flat iron, starting near your scalp. Keep your iron in a vertical position and bend it towards you. Glide the flat iron downward through your hair until you reach the end of the lock.Repeat until all your hair is curled.Use force when pulling your hair downward. You should not feel pain but you should be able to feel a slight tugging at your scalp. This can help your hair curl effectively the first time around.
 If the above method makes your hair look more curly than wavy, you can try making the curls bigger. This effect can easily be achieved with a flat iron.


Work in two-inch sections of hair. Clamp the flat iron down near your scalp. Twist the flat iron 90 degrees. You can twist the iron either towards your face or away from your face. Both methods are effective.Glide the iron down through your hair until you reach the end of the strand of hair. It's a similar process to curling a ribbon with a pair of scissors. Repeat this process, working with two-inch strands of hair, until all your hair is curled., If you want hair with only a slight wave, you can add a gentle bounce to the ends of your locks. Separate your hair into sections and work with locks 1 to 2 inches in width. Take a lock and place the flat iron three inches from the end of your hair. Then, flip it up about 90 degrees. Pull it down gently, creating a nice wave. Repeat with the remaining sections.

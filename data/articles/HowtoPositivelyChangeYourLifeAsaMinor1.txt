 While you don't have to shower three times a day, you do want to be a clean person overall. There are some things that everybody should do: Shower once a day; shampoo every other day; brush your teeth at least twice a day; do not wear the same clothes more than two days in a row; only wear underwear once. If you are old enough, wear deodorant, and shave (girls: armpits; guys: facial hair).;

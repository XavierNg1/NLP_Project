 The first step in cleaning a stamped concrete surface is removing loose dirt and grime from the surface. Use a broom to remove loose debris from the concrete. If it is an outdoor surface, you can use a leaf blower for extra assistance.;
, For regular cleaning of stamped concrete surfaces, a weekly wet mopping is usually sufficient. After sweeping the floor, dip a rope or foam mop into a bucket of warm water. Thoroughly mop the floor, rinsing the mop regularly. Make sure you change the mopping water when it becomes dirty., If water is not enough to clean your stamped concrete surface, you can add a nonabrasive cleanser to your mopping water. A few drops of dish soap, laundry detergent, or other mild detergent is usually enough to create an effective cleaning solution. Avoid chemical-based cleaners as these can dull the surface.

 These are heat, fuel and oxygen, and understanding the role that they play in forest fires will give you a good start to your fire management endeavors.


A fire has to be started by a heat source. It can be a natural source, like lightning, or a human-generated source, such as campfires, sparks or cigarette butts.
The fuel for a forest fire is generally dry grass, leaves, moss, shrubs and/or pine tree needles. These fine sources of fuel burn quickly and require less energy to burn than larger sources like full, live trees.
Sufficient oxygen must be present to sustain a fire, so when winds come through, they not only spread the fire to other fuel sources but also bring in fresh oxygen to keep the fire going.;
, Though you must be brave and courageous to fight a fire, you also must know the science behind what's going on to successfully fight it. Knowing how fire behaves and the meteorology and geography of the area will make containing the fire easier.


Contact your local colleges, universities, local fire departments and national parks. The firefighters in your city or staff at a local wildlife area may offer tutorials on firefighting and prevention.
 How intense a fire gets and how fast it can spread is directly related to wind speed, temperature and relative humidity. Other, severe conditions (like drought) can also play a role in the strength and number of wildfires in an area. Accurate and timely weather information is vital to the planning and execution of strategies for suppressing wildfires.


In the US alone, there are many different versions of the scales measuring fire potential. The ERC scale (Energy Release Component) relates fuel energy potential to an area, the Burning Index measures flame length against fire speed and temperature, the Haines index relies on stability and air humidity, and the Keeth-Byrun Drought Index works in the abstract, taking in a fuel's likelihood to burn and at what percentage.

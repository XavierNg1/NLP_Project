 Leave about two to three inches/5-7.5cm un-inflated at the end before you tie-off. A hand pump works best for this - not only is it more sanitary, but it is also difficult to inflate long balloons by mouth.;
, Starting at the knot, take a section about three inches/7.5cm from the top and twist two to three times. Hold the section to keep it from unraveling.
 Twist off 2 two-inch sections. Keep holding all of the sections.
 Fold between the ears so the nose and first ear section are along the length of the balloon. The ends of the ears should line up. While holding the nose and body in one hand, twist the ears with the other hand. Now you should have a nose, ears, and a long body.
 The length of the neck should be about nine inches/23cm - long enough to make it clear that this is a giraffe! Twist off the neck section and hold it (like in Step 2).
 These are usually about 3-4 inches/7.5-10cm. Continue to hold all of the sections.
 Using the same method as you did in Step 4, fold between the leg sections and twist them together.
 Take enough balloon to create the body (but keep in mind that you'll need 6-8 inches/15-20cm for the hind legs!) and twist off the section.
 Twist off 2 three-four inch sections for the legs. Fold and twist using the method from Step 4; the remaining balloon becomes the tail. Done! You have a giraffe!

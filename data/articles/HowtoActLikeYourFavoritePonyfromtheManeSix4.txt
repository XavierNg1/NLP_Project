 Pinkie Pie is always laughing and smiling. Be the fun and life of the party. Pinkie Pie does not act shy or hold herself back; she puts herself out there and smiles to the world!


If you have a tendency to be an introvert, then maybe you should try another inspiration so you don't have to worry about changing who you are.
She is also very friendly with any pony, so try to be nice to people despite their social differences.
Eat sweets or caffeine to keep your energy up!

, Put yourself out there; if something silly or random pops into your head, don't hesitate to say it loud and proud! Cheer up anyone who needs cheering up, and try your best to be funny. If you make a joke and nobody laughs, just laugh anyway, and make a remark such as, "Geez, we got a tough crowd here!" or just change to a better subject.
 Throw a party! There are some wikiHows for how to do this; just try to keep guests entertained and do things such as dancing, games, and serving cake. Nail those little quirks of bouncing up and down, talking quickly, and giggling, but tone it down a notch if people begin to find you annoying.
 Lots of hot pink and also some light blue and yellow will work great. Wear ruffly skirts and striped legging; have fun with this! Curl your hair, and if you want, go for a bright lipstick. Don't turn into a total clown face, though.
 Know when to be silly and when to be serious. Sing randomly or talk about "pinkie sense". There is such thing as too much.

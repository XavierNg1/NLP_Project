, You will only need Alicia and Welkin, but Largo and Rosie will increase your turns each round.
 Be sure Welkin destroys the cannon in the enemy's base. Leave Alicia behind for safety during this round.
 Have Alicia make a bee-line for the flag, using Welkin's tank as a shield.
 She can then capture the flag.

, Use your tank to block shots from the 3 troopers in front. Select ISARA Smoke 1. Target the middle shocktrooper at the bridge and fire. The smoke should cover the 2 Turrets and Light tank.
 Take out the light tank over the enemy main camp from the rear. Stay on the right side on the bridge. Largo will get hit by a mine but will get minimum damage, so no problem.
 Take out the Shocktrooper over the enemy main camp. Use Largo's path so there won't be any mines.
 Take out the Tank Destroyer from the rear and capture the enemy camp. You should get around 75k exp and 150k DCT.


You should have about 4 CP left. Use them for orders in case you need them.

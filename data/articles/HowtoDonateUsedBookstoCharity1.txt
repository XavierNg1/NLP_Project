 Before donating a book, make sure that it is in good condition. Look at the cover and make sure it is attached securely. Check for water damage or spills. Check for holes or significant rips in the pages. If the pages are severely yellowed, it may be time to recycle it. If the book has outdated information, recycle it.;
, Choose which books would benefit the populations you wish to serve. Keep in mind whether you want to donate to children, adults, university students or specialized populations.Think about the overall desirably of the book, and if the general public will read it. Will other people appreciate the book? If not, there's no use passing it along.


How-to books may not be a good option to send, such as a sewing book or model airplane book. Books that require other items are not good options.
 Options vary, and donation can be as simple as dropping the books in a dropbox. Other options may require you to buy mailing envelopes to ship your books. Consider the time you have and which populations you would like to assist with your donation. Then do some research, as some organizations have guidelines to which books they will accept, which may include thematic content and age appropriateness. The method you choose is entirely up to you, and should be decided beforehand.

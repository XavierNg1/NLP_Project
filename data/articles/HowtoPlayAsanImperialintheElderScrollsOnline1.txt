 If you purchase the digital version of the Imperial edition of Elder Scrolls Online, you will be given a number of in-game benefits. One such benefit is the ability to play as an Imperial. The Imperial Edition is available for all supported platforms. This includes the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC & Mac.


The Xbox One digital version can be purchased in the Xbox Games Store.
The PlayStation 4 digital version can be purchased in the PlayStation store.
The PC & Mac digital version can be purchased from Steam.
All three platforms can also be purchased from the official Elder Scrolls Online website.;
, If you prefer to purchase physical versions of games, you can also pick up the physical version of the Imperial Edition. The physical version comes with all the benefits of the digital version in addition to a physical 3D statue of Molag Bal, a map of Tamriel, and an art book named “The Emperor's Guide to Tamriel.”


Most retailers no longer have stock for the physical version of the Imperial Edition, so you may have better luck finding a second hand version of the physical version.
 If you have already purchased Elder Scrolls Online and do not wish to buy the full Imperial Edition you can instead purchase the Imperial Edition upgrade. The Imperial Edition Upgrade counts as a standalone digital DLC item and is available for all platforms via their respective stores. If you own Elder Scrolls Online on PC or Mac, you can purchase the upgrade from the Elderscrollsonline website.This upgrade will allow you to play as an Imperial and will give you all the additional digital benefits of the full Imperial Edition.

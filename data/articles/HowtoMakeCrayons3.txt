 If you have concerns that your children may try to eat crayons, try making them from food grade ingredients. These crayons use a blend of carnauba wax and tallow for the base.Use powdered herbs and veggies, and spices to make your colors. Use turmeric for yellow, beetroot powder for pink, and chlorella for green. Once you get the hang of making the crayons, experiment with different combinations to make new colors.You can buy tallow online or in the grocery store, or you can make your own. If you can't find tallow, you can substitute cacao butter, just make sure it is food grade., Add 1 oz of carnauba wax and 1.5 oz of tallow to a double boiler and melt. If you don't have a double boiler, you can melt the waxes together in a stainless steel bowl over a pot of boiling water., When the wax and tallow are melted completely, add in your pigments. Keep the mixture on a low heat as you whisk in your colors.To make pink, use 5 teaspoons of beetroot powder.To make yellow, use 1.25 teaspoons of turmeric.To make orange, use 1.25 teaspoons of ground annatto.Use 1.25 teaspoons of chlorella powder to make a deep green., Use a silicone ice stick mold to form your crayons. You can also use a mold with fun shapes, such as stars or gingerbread men.You may find that some of the mixtures leave a small amount of sludge at the bottom of the pan. This is the result of the powders settling. Discard this part of the mixture. Adding it to your crayon will make the crayons gritty and uneven.Let the crayons set completely before using them. Carnauba wax hardens quickly, so the crayons should only take a few hours to set.

 Choose two elastics that match your hair color. You will be using one of these two wrap your hair into a ponytail. You will be using the other one to hold your top knot together.
 Hold your hair with the hand that has the elastics on it. Use your other hand to pull one of the elastics off and wrap it around your ponytail.









Depending on the thickness of your hair, you may need to wrap the elastic two to three times.
, Divide it into three more sections and braid it. Tie it off with a thin, mini elastic. Repeat this step for the remaining two sections. You will end up with three mini braids.









Use a clear mini elastic or one that matches your hair color.
, Twist the braids until they start to coil around the base of the ponytail. Wrap the braids around the base of the ponytail.
 Hold the top knot with the hand that has the last hair tie on it. Use your other hand to wrap the hair tie around the top knot. Depending on the thickness of your hair, you will need to wrap the hair tie once or twice around the top knot.
 Tuck the ends of the braids under the top knot so that the elastics aren't visible. Fold the top knot over them, and secure it with some hair pins or bobby pins. Secure the rest of the top knot to your hair with more hair pins.









Use hair pins or bobby pins that match your hair color.

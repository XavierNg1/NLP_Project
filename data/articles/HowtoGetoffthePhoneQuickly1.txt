 You won't need to remember the numbers and can avoid unpleasant conversations with unwanted callers.]]Realize some friends and family may call people out of boredom. Since everyone is bored sometimes you should try to indulge them for at least a few moments. Try to think of why the person calls you and insist for speaking too long. Do you not talk often? Are they lonely?

, If you prefer not to talk on the phone, tell people. Just be polite and don't use excuse for select people who may get their feelings hurt. It is also not advised when you are young and speaking with your parents.


Being rude isn't generally necessary.
 Don't be rude to a friend. You may regret it later.
 They could be calling about an emergency.
 If they happen to call the other person or discuss it later you'll get caught in a lie.
, Just say, "Take me off your call list", and hang up. Don't give out information about your family, parents or household.
 Arrange to meet for lunch.
 Even if you don't know the person you can label it "Do Not Answer" or "Telemarketer". That way you won't struggle to remember a weird number or accidentally answer it.

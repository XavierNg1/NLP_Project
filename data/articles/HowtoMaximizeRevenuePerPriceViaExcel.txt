 You will need to understand how to take derivatives in calculus to find this article useful. You can learn of the process a bit here and more from the articles in Related WikiHows.;
, D(p) = y)
In cell C1, enter E(p) In cell D1, enter D Prime p (i.e. D'(p), the derivative of D(p).)
In cell E1, enter R=p*D(p)=xy (i.e. the Revenue Function).



Find the Derivative D'(p) (or D Prime p). This = -39.
Find E(p) = -p*D'(p) / D(p) = p*39 / (975 - 39p)
Set E(p) = to 1:  p*39 / (975 - 39p) = 1
Solve for p:  39p = 975 - 39p; 78p = 975; p = 12.5 
Revenue is maximized when price p = $12.50 and demand is unit elastic.
 Insert Name Define Name D_of_p to column B.
Edit Go To cell range C2:C27 and enter the formula w/o quotes "=-p*D_Prime_p/D_of_p" and Edit Fill Down. This column is next because it is in chart order next to y and easier that way.
Edit Go To cell range D2:D27 and enter -39 and Edit Fill Down. Insert Name Define Name D_Prime_p to column D.
Edit Go To cell range E2:E27 and enter w/o quotes the formula "=p*D_of_p" and Edit Fill Down.
Format Cell Fill yellow for cell range A17:E17 where p=12.5. D(p) = 487.50, E(p) = 1, D'(p)=-39 and R = $6.093.75 (at a local maximum of Revenue).
 Click on the bottom series 1 or 2 and do Chart Layout  Format Selection, Axis - Plot series on Secondary axis, OK. Edit the chart series title in the formula bar so that it reads "=SERIES("p=x,E(p)=y",Data!$A$2:$A$27,Data!$C$2:$C$27,1)". Click on the other series and edit it in the formula bar until it reads "=SERIES("p=x,D(p)=y",Data!$A$2:$A$27,Data!$B$2:$B$27,2)".
Select Chart Layout Axes and select Primary Horizontal Axis - Default Axis (or whichever axis aligns the 1 with the grid lines). Also set the horizontal scale to major unit 2.5. Set the Vertical Axis to Default Axis.
Select data point {12.5,1) and make marker square dot, black fill size 8. Select data point (12.5, 487.50) and make marker round circle red dot red fill size 8. Add left-aligned data labels to each pertinent data point.
 Read down and find that a E(p)=1, price p =12.5, so then move up the price gridline to the Demand Function D(p) and find the red dot and read that 487.5 units will be demanded at the price of $12.50, for a Total Revenue of $6,093.75 (per the yellow highlighted row #17). At this point, Marginal Revenue = $0.

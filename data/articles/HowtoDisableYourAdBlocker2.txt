 On an iPhone, ad blockers are installed as "Content Blockers," which automatically prevent you from accessing certain content while you browse. Content blockers can be deactivated in your iPhone's settings.


If you can't find the settings icon, swipe your finger to the right on your phone screen until you reach a search bar, type "Settings" into the search bar, and tap on the result that appears.
 Content blockers are controlled through the Safari app, and this is where you'll modify your adblocker's current settings.
 Here, you'll see a list of any plugin apps that are disabling ads on the sites you browse.
 By sliding the buttons located next to your content blockers to the left, you'll disable those plugins from running while you browse, allowing you full access to the content on a relevant site.


Safari on iOS also comes with a "Block Pop-ups" option located in the "General" section of Safari's settings. If you would like to enable the sites you are on to open new windows, toggle this button to "off".

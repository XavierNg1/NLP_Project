 Some dog beds will be advertised as “orthopedic,” but will not be constructed out of good, enduring materials. Stay away from beds made from egg crate foam, high memory fiber fill, convoluted foam, medical grade hospital foam, high density foam, foam chips, shredded memory foam, batting, cedar, recycled fiber, or polyester fiber., Instead, look for a dog bed made from slow recovery visco-elastic memory foam. This material provides the most support, and is also known for being long-lasting.Memory foam is rated from 3 to 5lbs., with 3 being the lowest quality memory foam, and 5 being the highest.
Selecting a higher quality memory foam will provide more support for your dog.
 Some orthopedic dog beds will offer a washable covers, while others will not. A washable cover is an excellent feature that helps you provide your dog with a clean place to sleep. If your dog experiences bladder leakage, look for a cover that is also waterproof.

 Is your company an obvious choice for an older worker to consider applying to, or is there a sense of a "youth culture" pervading your establishment's image? Think hard about what it is that you really want to portray - having a good mix of older and younger workers is usually a workplace strength.;
, When you advertise your employment opportunities, find your older workers and get them to help recruit other older workers. Use images of older workers as reassurances to older people that it is OK to apply.
 Write down the types of values that your organization considers older people bring to the workplace so that potential applicants can feel reassured that they're not wasting their time in applying.
 You can teach older humans many new tricks. Sometimes you need to dangle some carrots to make it worthwhile but most times having the faith that they can do it and explaining how it will improve their job will be motivation enough.



Be patient about any need for longer or extra training. Sometimes the understanding may take longer but once grasped, you will gain a very dedicated employee.

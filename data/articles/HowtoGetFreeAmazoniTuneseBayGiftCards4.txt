 These programs are similar to website-based online programs, though are targeted specifically towards mobile users. Some examples include:


MobileRewards
e-Rewards Mobile
JunoWallet

, Most mobile rewards programs will ask you to download other apps and games that advertise through the program. There are also often surveys that can be completed.


Be careful when purchasing apps for reward points. Each app may not seem like it costs that much, but a lot of small purchases can add up quickly.

 If your role, responsibilities, and daily tasks have been exactly the same for 2 or more years, your career may be stalled.;
, If you have not learned new skills that add value to your current role, you may not have the ability to take on new roles or responsibilities. For example, if you are a computer programmer, but have not learned any new programming languages within the last 2 or 3 years, your employer may be utilizing the skills of other programmers who have taken the time to learn new programming languages.
 If you participate in fewer projects or have a smaller work load than you did previously, your work load may be being distributed to other employees who are considered to be more valuable than you.
 In most cases, if your career is stalled, employees will no longer seek you for help or assistance, and your boss may not need to involve you in meetings and discussions as often.


Determine if you receive a significantly lower amount of emails and phone calls from your bosses and co-workers than you did several months or a few years ago.
 If your boss provides feedback that indicates your performance is average as opposed to above average, your career is most likely stalled.

 Though you may assume all teenage girls appreciate similar things, you could be drastically wrong. Ask her what favorite colors, bands, celebrities, hobbies, patterns, and room styles are. Get as much information about the girl as possible before beginning. Though not all of it may seem useful, any shred of information can help.;
, One, a comfortable bed. Two, a desk and chair to do homework and keep up on hobbies. Three, storage. Think wall-shelves, bookshelves, bins, and dressers with plenty of drawers. Teens are known for their messy habits, and if you have not given them a place to put their things...well, don't expect the room to remain clean. Beyond that, good lighting (especially around the desk) and other sitting (who doesn't love beanbags?) for friends are nice to have. Like a lounge area almost.
 A bedspread is a good place to start with the room's color scheme. Make sure it doesn't clash with the wall/carpet color, it's comfortable, and the girl will like the colors. Obviously, stay away from any colors or patterns she particularly dislikes.
 Bright drapes/curtains, rugs, desk accessories, and new lampshades are easy ways to add color. One great idea that many "hip" teens do is to put up white holiday lights in their room. It works best if the strands are white and that the lights have a swag to make it look better. Another great idea is to write her favorite song or poem in another language such as Japanese or Chinese and hang it above her desk. Don't forget, this is a teen, so keep it funky! How about some lava lamps or funky wall art?

, This is where the girl's interests can come into play. A few choice posters and photographs on the wall really add character to the room, and will make your teen feel right at home. Get her 2 or 3 posters (that she can hang up herself in case she wants them in a special place) of her favorite band, celebrity, movie, or anything else she may have mentioned to you!

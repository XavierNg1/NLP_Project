 Young children usually like talking in general, and especially like talking about themselves. Get to know them by asking them questions about their likes, dislikes, interests, etc.You don't have to grill them, but you can ask them a few questions to learn more about them.


Ask open-ended questions that have multiple parts.
For example, “What's your favorite cartoon and why?”
Try asking, “What was the most interesting part of your day? What made it interesting?”

, Games designed to help people get to know one another better are great to use with young children. They allow you to get to know more about each other and they are fun, which can relieve some of the tension. Try ‘Would You Rather’. Take turns choosing between two outrageous options. For example, would you rather be able to turn invisible or be super fast.
 One easy way to bond with young children is to notice what they play with, what decorates their room, etc. and talk about those things. Pay attention to the things that are important to them to learn more about them or get ideas for things to talk about.What books are they reading? TV shows do they watch?
What colors do they like to wear? What snack do they really enjoy?
What time of day (or night) ate they most energetic?

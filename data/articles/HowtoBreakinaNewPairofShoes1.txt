 Before you go out in them, try walking up stairs, standing around (cooking dinner, playing with kids, etc.), sitting down, and even running.










Note: This is the most trusted method for easily and lightly breaking in your new shoes. If you have nice leather or dress shoes — shoes that you would be frustrated to see scuffed, altered, or even discolored — this method is the safest to try.;
, When you try out new shoes before you've bought them, you rarely walk away with sore feet, right? That's because you haven't donned your shoes for long enough to cause any pain (or alter the frame of the shoe to fit your foot). So, when breaking shoes in at home, wear early, wear often, and don't feel like you need to put your shoes on for hours at a time to notice a difference.









In fact, start with wearing your shoes 10 minutes at a time in the beginning.Try this for a couple days. Gradually, wear your shoes for 10 minutes more, every couple of days, until you're wearing the shoes for an hour at a time. By this time, the shoes should be tamed!

, Wear some old shoes to work, but when you're sitting at your desk, bust out your new ones and simply get in the habit of having them on your feet. This is a simply way to break in your new shoes while saving time.
 This way, you can tell if you need socks when you wear them. This can also prevent blistering when getting used to new shoes.









Wear your shoes with socks that are a little bigger than you normally would use. Try thick cotton socks, and squeeze into the shoes. Don't do any heavy walking, or you'll give yourself blisters. Just keep your feet in the shoe. The size of the sock will help stretch out the frame.

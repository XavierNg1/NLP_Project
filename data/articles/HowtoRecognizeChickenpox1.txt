 Approximately one or two days after developing a runny nose and sneezing, you may see red spots on your skin. These dots often start on the chest, face, and back, are often itchy, and can quickly spread to the rest of the body.These red spots will turn into red bumps and then small blisters (vesicles). These spots contain the virus and are highly contagious. These blisters will crust over in several days. After all the blisters are crusted, the person will no longer be contagious.Insect bites, scabies, other viral rashes, impetigo, and syphilis may look like chickenpox.;
, Chickenpox may first present as a mild cold, with a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough. You may even develop a fever up to around 101 degrees Fahrenheit. If the infected person were exposed to someone with chickenpox or breakthrough chickenpox (a milder form of the illness in someone who has received the vaccine), mild cold symptoms may really be the initial symptoms of the chickenpox., Chickenpox is highly contagious and dangerous to persons who have problems with their immune system, such as people undergoing chemotherapy for cancer or who have HIV or AIDS, and most babies, because children are not vaccinated against chickenpox until they are at least 12 months old.

, Stay within the business's means while still purchasing commercial carpet that is high in quality.
 Certain types of yarns are more durable than others and better for areas with high foot traffic.


Tufted carpet with woven backing is ideal for areas where a lot of people will be walking. It has a backing that is punched through and glued to another backing made of plastic, which makes it strong and long-lasting. Most commercial carpets do have tufted construction for durability.
Commercial carpet made of nylon is not only ideal for areas with high traffic, but also does well in areas where it is likely to get wet and dirty. Nylon carpet looks good, lasts a long time and cleans easily.
Olefin yarn is softer and less expensive than other types of commercial carpet, but does not do well in areas with high foot traffic.
 Level loop has small loops and cut pile is short and plush.


Both types of commercial carpet are usually made of either nylon or olefin. However, level loop performs best in high-traffic areas. Cut pile works well in office settings.
 It is important to have the correct dimensions of the space so you are sure to purchase the correct amount of commercial carpet.


Round up to the nearest foot or meter so you are not short on the amount of carpet needed. If you have more than necessary, you can always trim it to fit.

 A huge part of what keeps people stuck in the victim mentality is the secondary gains they receive from having this outlook.Complaining, self-loathing, and comparing can all grant the person with affection, attention, or offers of help from others. This person may not even be consciously aware of their desire for sympathy, but it’s feeding and reinforcing the behavior.


To cope with a victim in your life, you must learn to starve them. Simply stop rewarding this person with the benefits of this miserable attitude.
Perhaps you used to dedicate hours showing concern to a relentlessly complaining friend. Rather you should be clear and succinct that you will not play into the behavior. You could say “I’m sorry to hear that…” and promptly change the subject. Or, you could challenge the person to take action by asking “So, what are you going to do about it?”

, Just because a friend or family member isn't taking responsibility for his or her own actions, that does not give you reason to shoulder that responsibility. You cannot “fix” this person or resolve their issues for them.


Chances are, you may be attracted to several victims in your life, especially if you like giving advice or resolving other people’s problems. Know that this savior complex is unhealthy for both you and the other person. Seek professional counseling to get to the bottom of your unhealthy need to enable others., When it comes to befriending a victim, your entire life may end up revolving around this other person. In order to help your loved one as best you can, you need to set boundaries to what behavior is acceptable and unacceptable.Learn how to say “no” when the other person’s requests or interruptions are too disruptive to your life.
Be clear about when they can and cannot reach out to you (e.g. refrain from contacting you at work, at school, or late at night).

 Polypropylene and polyester are common materials in rugs and carpeting.This makes carpeting containing these materials great for gaining negative electrical charges., The same as with other methods, friction between the items will help you build up an electrical charge. Continue rubbing for approximately thirty seconds.


Socks made of materials that easily gain positive charges will work even better. Try wearing wool socks.As with most static experiments, this works even better during dry winter months because humidity helps to eliminate static.
 The closer your victim is to you, the better. You'll lose the charge if you have to move around too much. You should also avoid touching any metal, or you'll end up shocking yourself instead.

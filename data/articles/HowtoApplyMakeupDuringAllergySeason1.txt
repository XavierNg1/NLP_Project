 If you suffer from eye allergies, like bloodshot or red eyes, try changing the color of your mascara and eyeliner. Don’t wear the normal black or brown. Go for a dark blue mascara and blue-toned eyeliner instead. The blue will help disguise the look of the redness.Brown or black mascara may make the redness more obvious.;
, Red eyes and runny noses are usually accompanied by watery eyes. Your eyes may tear up randomly, get watery when you sneeze, or start running. If you suffer from this, try a waterproof mascara.The waterproof mascara helps keep your eye makeup from smudging if your eyes start watering from allergies.
 If your eyes are bloodshot, you can use an eyeliner in a nude color to help counteract the redness. Choose a waterproof nude eyeliner. Put the eyeliner along the inner rims of your eyes. It’ll help make your eyes brighter and less red.You shouldn’t be able to tell you have on eyeliner. Wear something nude-colored or in a soft beige. Don’t wear white because it’ll look too stark and fake.
 Heavy eye makeup may make your symptoms worse during allergy season. Your eyes may be too tender to put on makeup or they may water a lot. To give your eyes a pop without makeup, apply some fake lashes instead of the makeup.

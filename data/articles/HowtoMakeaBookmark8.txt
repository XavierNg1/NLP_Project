, For example, you can add photos of your dog or cat, a friend or family member, etc. Or, stick on craft foam cut-outs, ribbon, glitter, etc.
 Make a border using a marker or stitch around the edge with embroidery yarn.
 Although optional, this can be a nice touch.
 Use the foam bookmark as often as you like. Make more to give away as gifts.

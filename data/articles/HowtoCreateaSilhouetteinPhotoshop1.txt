 This method is perfect for simple, easy images where the subject is clearly separated from the background. If the object you're silhouetting is a very different color, has some distance, or is just easy to separate, this method will work perfectly.


If, after opening the image, you see that there is a padlock on the layer, simply double-click on the layer and hit "Enter" to unlock the layer.;
, To do so, simply right-click on the layer and select "Duplicate." You can also click on "Layer" → "Duplicate Layer" from the top bar, or press ⌘ Cmd+J or Ctrl+J.
 For more precise work you'll need to refine this selection, but for a basic silhouette you should be able to quickly click and drag Quick Selection Tool over the image to select the object. If you can't find the Quick Selection tool, it should be the fourth button down from the toolbar, and you may have to click and hold on the "Magic Wand" to reveal it. For even more control:


Hold either Alt or ⌥ Opt while clicking to remove parts of your selection.
Use the two keys to make your selection tool bigger or smaller, making it less or more precise.
Switch to the Magic Want to quickly select all pixels of similar colors. Ctrl-Click to add selection, alt-click to subtract it., With your selection still on, click on "Image" → "Adjustments" → "Hue and Saturation." You can also get to this menu by:


Selection "Hue and Saturation" from the Adjustment's panel, usually right above your layers panel.
Pressing either ⌘ Cmd+U or Ctrl+U, Take the Hue and Saturation sliders to "0," and the lightness to "-100." The hit "OK." Your image should be silhouetted, or, at least, much darker. If the silhouette is too light the first time, just open the Hue/Saturation options again and do it once more. You can keep lowering lightness until you have your silhouette.

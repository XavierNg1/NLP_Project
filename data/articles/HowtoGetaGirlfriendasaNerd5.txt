 Don't test her knowledge or treat her like she's a lesser geek if she hasn't been doing nerdy stuff for as long or if she is nerdy in different ways than you. She enjoys and loves things and you enjoy and love things and that is cool and you should be happy.
 She's probably just as smart if not smarter than you in a few areas. If she was really so dumb or incompetent, you wouldn't want to be with her. Respect her, appreciate the things she's good at or knows about, and give her the opportunity to show you those things. Definitely don't be mean about it or trivializing if she doesn't know something.
 Shouting about sympathizing with those ideas is putting yourself on the fast track to girls thinking you're disrespectful and a jerk. Equality is good, but you need to try really hard to understand the whole issue. Starting arguments with someone who you care about, on topics that you know you disagree on, is never a good idea.
 Just...don't. You're doing both of you a disservice. Just be honest with her and say what you're really feeling.

 You may have to go to the courthouse to view the calendar, or it may be available online.


If you want a hearing for a motion, be aware that many courts only hear civil motions on specific days of the week. You'll have to pick a "motion day" that works for you. Arrive at 9 a.m. on that day and be prepared to stay all day.Courts typically close their motion day dockets a week or two before., Once you've chosen the date you want, call the clerk and have your motion scheduled on that date.
 You must draft a notice of hearing along with your motion that includes the date you've scheduled the hearing.


In some courts, simply filling in the date on the notice of hearing is not enough to actually schedule it â€“ you must have the hearing scheduled through the judge's chambers.In some jurisdictions, you must file a separate form requesting the court set a trial or hearing in your case. A conference may be held with the judge and all parties to set the hearing., You must file your motion with the clerk of the court that will be hearing the motion.


When you file your motion, you'll have to pay a filing fee. Depending on your jurisdiction and the type of motion your filing, the fee could be less than a hundred or several hundred dollars.If you cannot afford the fee, you can file an application to have fees waived., After you've filed your motion, you must serve the other parties with copies of your motion and notice of hearing so they know what you're asking the court and when the court will hear it.


The certificate of service you include with your motion details the method for serving the other parties. Typically you would use the sheriff's department to serve personally, or mail the documents using certified mail with returned receipt requested.

 Are you into the music? Do you want to look like a cyber goth chick? Are you trying to live your life as if you're from the 1400s or as a vampire? The definition of what being 'goth' is has changed so much that you need to decide what you like and want out of the subculture.;
, Go to a goth show or two - many of them are all ages. Remember that while these bands are considered gothic you don't have to listen to them to be a goth. Listen to what you like, not what others tell you to. Checking out a song or two still would be a good idea.
 Research will help you get more of an idea of the look you are going for and make it easier to achieve. Knowledge also make you look less like a poser.
 Figure out what you want to look like, and go for it! That way your clothes will more fully represent you. Take a sewing class or two to make sure your clothes don't fall apart!

, Some outfit examples are: Sweeter goth, good for easing into the look; Mary Janes, knee high sock, black skirt puffed up with a petticoat, and a nice, preferably fluffy, blouse or more of a club look (make sure your parents would allow it before wearing it): Boots, ripped fishnets, miniskirt, and a tank top.
 While this is not necessarily needed, it helps complete the goth look. Remember to make sure that your makeup goes well with your clothes, is appropriate for whatever you are doing at the time, and that you parents are OK with it. Reading up on school dress codes might not be a bad idea.

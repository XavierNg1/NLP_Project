 When you’re wearing a headband with an updo, choosing the right style is key. When you’re going casual, it’s best to choose a thin, delicate headband that won’t overwhelm your look with your hair all pulled up and back. If you’re wearing your updo to a formal event, pair it with an embellished headband that features pearls, rhinestones, crystals, or other beads for a more sophisticated look., After you’ve selected a headband, brush your hair and pull it up into your chosen updo. You can opt for a simple top knot bun, a fancy French twist, a sophisticated chignon, or whatever style you prefer.








It’s often easier to do an updo if your hair has some texture to it. That’s why it’s best to start with hair that hasn’t been washed in a day or so. If you have washed your hair, use some dry shampoo or a texturizing spray to add some texture.
 Once your hair is pulled up into the updo, place your headband in your hair. As with a ponytail or braid, you don’t necessarily have to position it just behind your hairline. Depending on the design of your headband, you may want to push it forward to create a tiara effect or push it back further so the embellished details are closer to the updo itself.








If you’re wearing a fabric or stretchy headband with your updo, you may way to use a few bobby pins to pin the band in place at the sides of your head or the nape of your neck to secure it.
 It’s easy for strands of hair to slip loose from an updo, so it’s a good idea to use hairspray before you leave the house. Opt for a flexible hold spray, though, so you hair won’t feel stiff or crunchy.

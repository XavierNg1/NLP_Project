 SMART stands for specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely.For example, if you want to lose 10 pounds (4.5 kg) to look good in your summer clothing, aim to lose about 1 pound (0.45 kg) per week. Losing 10 pounds (4.5 kg) is specific. The weekly target is measurable. Because it’s a small target, it’s one that you can realistically attain. You’ve made it relevant with a reason for losing weight and timely by setting a deadline.;
, Make a note of what you need to do in order to reach each goal. For example, in order to meet your weekly weight-loss target, you’ll need to figure out how many calories you need to burn each day based on your height and current weight.If you want to improve your smile, make an appointment with your dentist for a checkup, improved hygiene tips, and a treatment plan, if necessary.
 Every time you meet a goal on your makeover list, treat yourself to something nice. For example, after you’ve lost your first 1 pound (0.45 kg), you might take a few hours of “me” time to watch your favorite movie. After 5 pounds (2.3 kg), maybe a shopping trip is in order. This positive reinforcement will make you less likely to lose interest in your game plan., Do this before starting a workout or changing your diet. Talk to them about your goals. Bring a copy of your action plan so they can look over it and let you know if you need to change anything. You could even ask if they can refer you to a personal trainer if you need that extra shot of motivation.

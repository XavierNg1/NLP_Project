 Leave about 6-8" (15 - 20 cm) of the sheet in one hand to tie the knot with. Hold the bed sheet above either shoulder with the corresponding hand (left hand to left shoulder, right hand to right shoulder, etc.).;
, Then tuck it under the opposite arm.
 If the toga is too long, fold one edge over by about six inches (15 cm), and try again. Keep adjusting until you get the right length, which is around the knee area.
 Tuck the sheet under the arm you're holding it with, then once more around the front of your chest, under the opposite arm, and across your back.
 Bring the second corner of the sheet up over your back to the corner in your hand. Secure the two ends with a brooch, pin, or simple knot.
 Use a couple of safety pins inside the toga if necessary.

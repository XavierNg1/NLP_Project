 Pour the milk in slowly and use a spoon to stir it into the rice. Make sure the heat is reduced so that the mixture simmers; if you keep it too high, the texture won't come out right.
 Check to make sure it isn't cooking too quickly; if so, reduce the heat.









While the rice is simmering, taste it to determine whether it needs a little more salt. Add a little at a time until it tastes right.
It's not traditional in Sri Lanka to add extra ingredients, but you can sweeten the dish with a little sugar or make it more savory with pepper and other spices if you'd like to customize it.
 The dish will have the consistency of creamy porridge. Let it cool for about five minutes.

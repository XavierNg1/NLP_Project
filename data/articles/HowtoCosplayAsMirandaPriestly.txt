, If anyone can recognize a flaw about you, don't let it be what you're wearing. Always look sophisticated and classy. Try setting trends, but nothing too outrageous. Remember: You are better than everyone else, therefore you must present yourself in that manner

, Miranda prefers phone numbers to be separated by periods (ex. 917.555.3345). You could do this as it's not a total steal from her, but find other things as well

, It sounds extremely shallow because it is. But you clicked on this article and Miranda is shallow. Always make little remarks about people's outfits or style.

 No British accent required, but no street slang

 Don't be afraid to speak your mind, or express your opinions.

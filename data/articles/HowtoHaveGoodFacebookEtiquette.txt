 Even if your response was to ignore the request/delete the request, you might as well tell the person why you did so. Be careful, as accepting a request that should have been ignored, can cause massive confusion, as the Facebook notification light will be triggered, when they see you have accepted it.;
, And if you send it where only your friend can see it, it may seem to become degrading on the person's morale.
 If not out of consideration for their feelings, then at least out of consideration for a potentially awkward run-in with them in the future, don't just remove them.
 If both parties want, you may communicate with them and tell them about the service and they might set it up themselves.
, Just because one of your friends on Facebook says that they are online, doesn't mean that they have to always stare at your (and only your) chat message. Yes, some software pieces can now help you in holding Facebook chats, but for those who still don't have these software pieces, cool your jets for how many messages you send per day.


Just because you might find it flattering to post a picture in one way, doesn't mean your friends will mind either, if they, in the same pose had a negative experience and weren't that flattering.
 Just because you think something is cool (if you are about to post a status update to your friends), doesn't mean that they'll like you any more if you send them an additional invite (unless they specifically ask you to).

 Shake together 1.5 oz whiskey, 0.5 oz lemon juice, 2 tsp Bénédictine, 0.25 oz simple syrup, and a handful of ice.Be sure to shake until the egg white breaks up completely. If you're having trouble with this, shake once without ice, then a second time with.
If you don't have Bénédictine, try yellow Chartreuse or (in a pinch) Drambuie., Serve over the rocks in a rocks glass, or straight up in a cocktail glass.
 Pour 0.5 oz dark rum over the back of a spoon, onto the side of the glass. Hopefully, this will float in its own separate layer. In practice, many rums and whiskeys are similar in density, and will mix together rapidly.Increase the odds of floating by chilling the ingredients and glass, and by choosing a whiskey and rum with significantly different proofs.
 Rum adds a tropical theme that pairs well with pineapple skewer.You may leave out the garnish if you prefer to focus on the complex blend of ingredients.

 Get a good night's sleep, and eat healthy. This is essential, and not only for your grades. It will seriously make your day better, and you'll get lots of energy.
 This is important. Also, get rid of things that might distract you. Put your computer away (unless you need it for studying), and turn off the TV. Use the computer only for doing homework, not slacking off to websites like Facebook and Twitter.
 Think of the good side of doing the homework. If you do it and get all the 10 points, your grade will be better! Better grades means a good job that you like, a job means money, and money means that you can do and buy almost anything.
 Although many teachers discourage doing everything at once, you really should. You'll be done with your homework right away. If you think that "you can do it later", later will be "never". Besides, if you're done with your homework, you can do whatever you want to afterwards.
 Then you'll plow through the easy stuff and be done. The easy stuff is like the dessert.
 Take notes, and be active. There are three reasons for this; your teacher sees that you're doing your best and that you're listening to him/her, you'll learn much more when focusing, and your notes will make your homework easier. Sometimes, you won't even have to do your homework because everything is in your notes!

, You will have more time then, and more time means better assignments. Besides, when you're done with your homework, you can done whatever you want to, and you won't have to think about your task anymore, unless you want to work more on it.
 Get a day planner/calendar, and write down everything you have to do. Once this becomes a habit, doing homework will get much, much easier - seriously.

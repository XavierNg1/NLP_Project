 Polymer clay brands include Fimo, Sculpey, Primo and often there is a store brand available depending on where you go. You will want to choose your brand according to baking times that suit you and a price that isn't going to cost you an arm and a leg. If you're just starting out with Polymer clay, buy a selection of brands. Work with them for a couple of weeks and then you can pick your favourite. Everyone has their own preference,so just choose what suits You!;
, Luckily with oven-bake clay you have a lot of time to think about what you're making and how you want to do it because it won't dry out for at least 7 months left alone. Even so, it's a good idea to draw a plan or have a general idea in your mind. Keep it simple and to your level. If you're a beginner you don't want to be making fully detailed sculptures. See the tips section for more information on level

, Get a couple of shapes together. Most things can be made from a ball so first start by rolling out a couple of balls varying in size. Play about with them by squashing, pinching, rolling and squishing the clay. When you have the shape you want, make another. Say if I had just made a rectangle then I would now make another smaller rectangle for my Robots arms,it all depends on what your model is.
 You don't want them to fall off once they are backed. You can use bake 'n' bond if you need help doing this. If you're using white clay you can either paint it now or after baking. It makes no difference. If you want this charm to be on a pendant or keyring attach an eye pin through it. These are found it most craft stores or online and are very cheap. Just cut it down to size with wire cutters and poke it through the top of your model but not all the way through! This will be baked in later.
 Look on the back of your packet of clay for baking times and temperatures. These will vary depending on brands. You can always use a glaze afterward to make these shiny.

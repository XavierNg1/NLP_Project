 Pour 100 mL of liquid into a pre-weighed graduated cylinder. Make sure that your measurement is correct, and then write the volume down as 100 mL. You can write in a lab journal or notebook., Put the sample of liquid on a scale. Measure the mass of 100 mL of your liquid. Subtract the weight of the graduated cylinder from the total weight to obtain the mass of your liquid.The measurement shown on the scale is the total mass of the liquid and the cylinder.
 Density is equal to the mass of the liquid divided by the volume of the liquid. In this case, you have measured both. You will simply divide the mass by 100 mL.For example, if your liquid had a mass of 125 g, you would divide that by 100 mL. Your resulting answer would be 1.25 g/mL

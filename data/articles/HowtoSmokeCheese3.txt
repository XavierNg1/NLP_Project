 This refrigerator may develop an ineradicable smoky flavor, and needs to be completely empty. This should be kept in an area without nearby fire hazards, such as a garage or basement with concrete floors and no flammable materials nearby. The refrigerator does not need to be functional.


Refer to the "preparing the cheese" instructions at the top of the page before you continue.
 Place a hot plate on the bottom of the fridge, preferably one with a temperature control.
 Place a small bread pan, tin can, or other heat-safe container over the hot plate. Fill it with wood chips or wood pellets intended for smoking, or taken from a source of pure wood with no toxic additives.


See the tips section for advice on wood flavors.
 Above the hot plate, fill a large container with ice. This will keep the cheese cool and prevent it from melting.
 Lay the cheese pieces on the upper rack of the refrigerator. Turn on the hot plate to a low setting and shut the refrigerator door.
 Check every 10–15 minutes for these problems and correct them if necessary:


If the ice has melted, replace the ice water with fresh ice.
If the cheese develops sweat beads, turn off the hot plate until the cheese cools down.
Once the cheese develops a smoke ring around the edge, flip it over. Once the smoke ring is on both sides, remove from the setup and turn off the hot plate.
 Wrap in wax paper and refrigerate for at least a week for best flavor. Some cheeses taste best after two to four weeks for smoking.


Don't give up on a nasty-tasting cheese directly from the smoker – er, the refrigerator. The flavor often improves dramatically.

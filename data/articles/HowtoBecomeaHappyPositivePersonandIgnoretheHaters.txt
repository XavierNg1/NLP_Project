 Everyone wants to become popular and fit but if you embrace your individuality and reject the status, you will be fine.;
, Life might only seem to favour and reward the hallowed and favoured few which half the time don't deserve it but please try to remember that you are a lovely and kind person and that can not be taught or given.
 Look in the mirror and for every bad thing you think you must find two good things about your life and yourself.



Life can be an unpredictable roller coaster but those who survive it and those you confide in and help others(clique as it sounds) are among the best out there.
 Life goes on and don't let a down day or a snide comment get you down. Easier said than done but if you are feeling negative and rotten and shy underneath act confident and positive and with commitment and practice you will believe it.
, Are you just going to give in and give them what they want. NO! IGNORE them they aren't worth it.
 Do not go through life with any regrets and don't let you hard work be ruined.
, It's the small gestures that will leave you heavily rewarded.
, You may not be as good as someone else at a particular thing but just focus on being the best you, you can be.

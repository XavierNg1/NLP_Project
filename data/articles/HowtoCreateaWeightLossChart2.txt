 Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet program that is compatible with PCs and Mac OSx computers and the mobile operating system iOs. It has the ability to make calculations and form graphs and charts based on the data you enter into the spreadsheet.


Move your cursor to the top two left columns in the spreadsheet. Name the first column "Date" and the second column "Weight." Fill in the date and weight data that you currently weigh. Don't worry if you only have information for one or two days to add to the chart.
If you want to keep just a simple log of your weight and its corresponding date on which you weighed yourself, you could just use these two columns here to record your progress.
If you do not have Excel, you can also try using Google Sheets, which is available for free on-line.You can find it if you type "Google Sheets" into the Google search engine., If you want to take the data you have entered into the date and weight columns and turn it into a line graph chart, you can see the ups and downs in your weight loss journey.


Open the Excel Fluent Ribbon by going to the Insert tab and then selecting Charts. A number of different chart templates will appear in the upper left corner of the spreadsheet.Select the Line option from the different graph options in the menu. As you click on that, a series of different line options to use will appear. Choose the "marked line" graph option.
Then name the X and Y axis. Find the "Select Option" in the menu bar. You can also right click on the graph and click the "Select Data" option. This will allow you to define the columns you want to include in the chart. It will also allow you to name the X and Y axis.
 The advantage to creating your own chart is that you can add extra values to it. If you want to measure things such as your heart rate, waist measurement in inches, blood pressure or mood, you can also add these to the chart.

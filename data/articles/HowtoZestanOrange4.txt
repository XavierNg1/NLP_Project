 Hold the peeler or knife against the orange's skin. Press down hard enough so that you remove the top layer of the rind. Do not remove the pith inside the orange.








Since this method removes relatively large pieces of rind, rather than fine chopping the pieces, this may be a good place to use that Mini-Processor., Avoid using any section of the orange more than once, since you don't want pith mixed in with the zest.
, Using a knife or peeler to peel an orange results in large pieces that need to be chopped up so you can use them as zest. Use a sharp knife to chop the peeled pieces finely. Depending upon the volume needed and any appearance concerns, reducing the peels to zest may be a task for the Mini Food Processor, if available. Measure out the amount you need for your recipe.

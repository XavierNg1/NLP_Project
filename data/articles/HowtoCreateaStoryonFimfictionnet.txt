 If you whip up a fanfiction while creating the page for it, chances are that it won't be very good. Put some thought in before creating it.;
, Once you have a clear idea, simply select "New Story" under the Story tab.
 Title the fanfic, identify if it is a sequel, and add two descriptions: a short description to catch the eye of passing users, and a long description to fill in users who click on your story.
 This is to block users from accessing the story while it is unpublished. Make sure it is something that you will remember.
 Select files on your computer to add cover art, which will act as the head display of your story. If the cover art is uploaded to an external site, provide a URL to act as a source.
 Unless it is a one-shot, it should automatically be "Incomplete". On completion, or if circumstances arise, you can go back and move the status to "Completed", "Hiatus", or "Cancelled".
 Quaint, cute stories with soft messages should be under "Everyone". Darker, serious stories with occasional language and violence should be under "Teen". Stories with adult themes, strong violence, cursing, and such should be under "Mature".


If you have selected Teen or Mature, please specify if the story includes sex or gore.
 You can have up to 6.


The categories include Romance, Tragedy, Sad, Dark, Comedy, Random, Crossover, Adventure, Slice of Life, Alternate Universe, Human, and Anthro.
You cannot choose categories that conflict each other (for example, Adventure and Slice of Life).
 You may choose up to 5.
 Make sure you are certain that you know what you're doing, and hit "Create Story".

 Don't rush in buying the shoes. Yes, i know that they are so beautiful you can't help yourself. But are they comfortable? Try them on in the shoe store. Wear them for about 10 minutes at a NORMAL pace, not too slow(as we usually do in a store). After 10 minutes you will understand if the shoes are comfortable or not.;
, Between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. is the perfect time to try the shoes on.
 Most shoes that cost less are of very bad quality, and they can not only ruin your look, but also your feet, and overall your mood. Also, buy only leather shoes with soft leather interior, to prevent skin swelling and sore feet.
 If the heel is between 3 and 5 inches, you can easily wear the heels without a platform. But if the heel is above 5 inches (12.7Â cm), you MUST choose your heels with a platform. The reason to this is to prevent backache, sore feet and lack of balance, and the most important, the impossibility to walk.

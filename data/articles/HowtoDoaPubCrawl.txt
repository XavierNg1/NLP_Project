Google also offers a GPS map option (if you're on your smartphone) that can show you how the locations of the pubs relate to one another. Seeing the locations allows you to pick an area where a few interesting pubs are clustered together so there's not a large time gap between each hit.;
, If there's an obvious best spot (most pubs of interest clustered together) with few outliers in your area, then this is your location for the night., This can happen either before or after choosing your location.

If you have a special night (anniversary, birthday, etc.), then you need to choose your location based on the date of said crawl.
If you have multiple nights to decide between, it might be to your advantage to select the date of your crawl after viewing the hours of the establishments you wish to visit--as this can limit the nights you're able to go.
 Group messages are a ton of fun and can lead to some silly text-antics. Let them know which night you'll be taking libations together and make sure it jives with everyone's schedules.

Let them know the locations and ask for further suggestions and/or revisions due to information you may have missed.
 Good pubs will typically have a cab option, which your group should consider as it's a cheap price to pay for everyone to be able to drink.

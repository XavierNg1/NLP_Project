 Concoct a mixture of two parts white vinegar, and one part water (cold or warm). Pour the mixture onto the stain, and let it soak overnight. Then, wash your garment as you normally would.


Some people can't stand the smell of vinegar. If that's the case for you, skip ahead to one of the following options below.
 Create a paste out of baking soda and warm water. Use just enough baking soda and water to make a paste-like texture. Then, get an clean toothbrush and firmly apply the paste to the area. Gently scrub back and forth, then let the stain sit for a few hours. Finally, rinse the stain.
 Put them in a cup. Then, add about two tablespoons of water until the mixture becomes paste-like. Apply it onto the stain, and let it sit for an hour. Rinse the stained part of the garment.
 Lightly sprinkle salt onto the stain. Then squeeze some lemon juice onto the stain until it's saturated. Rub the stain until it's gone, and then launder your jeans.


This is a great preventative measure as well. You could use the mixture on shirts you know you'll sweat in (like gym shirts).
Keep in mind that lemon juice might lighten your jeans' color.

 There are two basic products on the market that are referred to as a seat belt alarm stopper. One is simply an unattached seat belt clip that can be inserted into the receptacle. The other is an extender that clips into the receptacle, but also provides an additional receptacle so that you can use your seat belt without removing the alarm stopper.;
, If you plan to use a seat belt on the same side as you will be using the stopper, buy the extender. If this is not the case, go for the basic stopper. Both are inexpensive and can be found at a local parts store or by shopping online.
 Make sure that your stopper fits your seat belt receptacle. Then, simply click the stopper into your receptacle. You are now free of the dinging alarm sounds.

 Many doctors are skeptical about the effectiveness of scalp hypothermia, so you may need to find an oncologist with knowledge and/or experience with this treatment to prevent hair loss.


Doctors only recommend scalp hypothermia for patients with cancers that do not threaten to spread to the brain.;

Since scalp hypothermia is a relatively new treatment for preventing hair loss in the United States, many insurance companies may not cover the costs of purchasing the caps and the freezers used to chill them. A typical treatment session may require the use of 15 caps or more. The caps are used during 30 minute intervals while the patient is undergoing a chemotherapy treatment session.
 The nursing staff can also be helpful during these treatment sessions.


Using the cold caps before, during and after chemotherapy improves a patient's odds of preventing hair loss. Adding scalp hypothermia will also extend the time you spend in the hospital during chemotherapy sessions.

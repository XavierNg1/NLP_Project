 Remove the jug handle by cutting one end of the pin that holds it in. (Use the handles for some other project.) Use a heat gun or hair dryer to soften the labels to remove them.;
, Turn the jug upside down and cut out a rectangle, leaving an edge all around.
 Cut the holes out on the sides and top only, using a SoniCrafter or whatever you have that will cut through tough plastic.


Cut off the top 2/3, leaving the bottom 1/3 to attach your bottle/cup to.






At this point, score along the bottom, so that the flap can be bent inward.
 Use the miter saw to cut off the top of the bottle. (If you are using plastic cups, you can skip this step).
 Set the half bottles/cups in the holes of the planter. The top of the "pot" should be just a little above the top of the hole, just so that it doesn't slip inside. Cut off any excess bottle/cup.
 Drill a hole a little smaller than the screw through each bottle/cup half bottom, and the flap on each hole. Screw each cup to each flap.
 Measure the space between the top of the holes to the bottom of the "pots" and cut a scrap piece of board to fit in and use as a wedge to keep the pots up against the planter. Caulk around the outside edges of each "pot", sides and bottom. Add the caulk to the sides of each "pot" on the inside. After the caulking has dried, you'll probably need to check it over and recaulk any areas that you missed.
 Let the caulking cure for the time advised. Once this is done, drill drainage holes in the bottom of the planter.
 Sand it just to roughen it up a bit and wipe it down. You are now ready to paint. Paint with a spray paint made for plastic.
 Pictured here is the finished "Strawberry Jar".

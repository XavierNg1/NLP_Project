 Then we would subtract each individual score (X) from the mean. This tells us how far away this person is from the average. You should have a new score for each person.     


In the formula that is: X-Mx;
, We find the average level of happiness (My); then subtract each individual score (Y) from the mean. Again, you'll have a score for each person.     


In the formula that is: Y-My

, Once again, you'll have a new score for each person.     


In the formula that is: (X-Mx)(Y-My)

, That's what the funny-shaped "E" means in the formula. "Σ" is the Greek symbol for Sigma, and is used in stats to signify that you should add everything up.     


In the formula that is: Σ(X-Mx)(Y-My)

,     


In the formula that is: N-1

,

In the formula that is: SxSy

,     


In the formula that is: (N-1)SxSy

,, r is the symbol used to denote the Pearson Correlation Coefficient).


A score of .1-.3 indicates a small relationship
31-.5 is a moderate relationship
.51-.7 is a large relationship
anything above .7 is a very strong (sometimes called "isomorphic") relationship.  
A positive number means they move the same direction (as chocolate consumption goes up, so does a person’s happiness, and if chocolate consumption goes down, so does happiness). It doesn’t mean they both go UP—but it means they move together.
A negative number means the variables move in opposite directions. That would mean that people were less happy as they ate chocolate, or people ate less chocolate when they were happy.

 Stand facing the barre. Stand on your tiptoes and bend your right knee, forcing your weight onto your right toes and driving your left heel towards the floor. Then switch feet. Alternate between the two feet to complete two sets of eight.It doesn’t really matter what you hold onto, as long as it’s something stable. If you don’t have access to a barre, try using a countertop or the back of a dining room chair.
Try repeating the prance exercise again, but turned out into first position.
 Stand at the barre in first position. Rise onto your toes, into what’s known as demi pointe and then slowly return your heels to the floor.Your weight should be centrally positioned. Don’t put too much weight on your big toe or baby toe.
Glue your inner thighs together and engage your abs.
 Sit on the floor with your feet extended in front of you. Place a hand towel at the tip of your toes. Grabbing the towel with your toes, pull it towards you until it is fully gathered under the arch of your foot.To reduce cramping, roll your arch out with a golf ball. Place a golf ball under your foot and roll it from your toes to your heels. Spend fifteen seconds under your toes, under the arch of your foot and then under your heel. Then slowly roll the ball back and forth without stopping.Try freezing the golf ball for the ultimate roll out.

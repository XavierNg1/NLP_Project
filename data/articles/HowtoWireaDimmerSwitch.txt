Pick an incandescent switch for traditional bulbs that gives off light when the filaments heat up.
Opt for an electronic low-voltage switch if the bulbs are small and used for decorative lighting.
Buy a fluorescent switch, a special dimming ballast, for fluorescent lights that contains a gas that lights up when charged.
Select a dimmer switch that is intended for CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lights) which use less power and last longer.;

Locate your circuit breaker box and the circuit breaker specific to the lighting fixture to be wired.
Turn off that circuit breaker.



Remove the faceplate from the switch with a screwdriver.
Touch a non-contact voltage detector to each of the 2 screw terminals.
If it lights, electricity is still on, and you are at risk, so return to the circuit breaker to determine if it is off and/or if it is the correct circuit breaker.
If the voltage detector does not light, the electricity is off, and you can proceed.

Keep the wires separate; they are stiff and likely to stay in place when you bend them.






Strip insulation away to expose 3/8 inch (0.9525 cm) of wire.



Use needle-nose pliers to wrap the wire tips around their respective terminals.
Use a screwdriver to tighten the screws at the terminals to secure the wires.



Pair each wire from the electric box with the respective wire on the dimmer switch.
Use needle-nose pliers to twist exposed ends of wires around each other.
Tighten a wire nut around each such connection.
Wrap this wire connection with a 3 inch (7.62 cm) strip of electric tape.


Attach the ground wire to the ground post in the box.
Clip a grounding clip to the bottom edge of the box if there is no grounding post.



Try to fold the wires like an accordion to avoid crowding.

 It's the most simple reflex in the human body. When you take a deep breath, your body automatically relaxes. Being relaxed is a good way to show your crush that you're a calm and relaxed person. Everyone likes to hang around with someone who's cool as a cucumber. In through your nose, out through your mouth.;
, Unless the occasion is somber, put a smile on your face, like you're enjoying what's going on around you and are engaged in the conversation. If you're alone, a content look will suffice. This also makes you look relaxed.
 If your crush says something humorous, laugh. Don't laugh at every word that comes out of his/her mouth, just when he/she cracks a joke or double entendre.
 This is a given. No one wants to be around someone who smells. Take a bath or shower everyday, and wear deodorant. If you're a girl, wearing a little makeup is good, but not a necessity.
 "In order to have a friend, be a friend." This almost always is the case. You want to befriend your crush, but at the same time try to avoid "the friend-trap". This is where you get so close in a friendship, risking it for a relationship wouldn't be advisable. Be close and hang out, but not too often, unless you know he/she likes you too.
 Not to your friends, not on your Facebook or Myspace. To the girl/guy you like. It may be awkward. But that's part of the magic!

 Abusive people often fluctuate between extremes of emotion.They may seem to have a “snap” emotional reflex or be hypersensitive. Mood swings and explosive emotions, especially anger, are common, as is “bottling up” emotions.Abusers are often “codependent.” They feel as though they cannot be complete without another person and depend on the other person for fulfilling all of their needs.;
, Abusers often have extremely unrealistic expectations. They may expect perfection or say things like “You’re the only person I need.” When things do not meet these unrealistic expectations, abusers are likely to get angry.Abusive people may also become angry or violent over even minor issues, such as their child's low grade on a test or a grocery bill that's higher than usual.
 While this is not the only cause of domestic violence, some abusers may abuse alcohol or drugs. They may excuse their actions as a result of their substance use.A person does not simply “become” violent when s/he drinks. Domestic violence is not the product of a loss of control. It is a pattern of abuse designed to keep you under their control.
Some abusers may force their partners to take drugs and alcohol against their will. An abused partner may also partake in drugs or alcohol as a way to “manage” her abuser.

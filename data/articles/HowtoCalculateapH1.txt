 The pH is the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. A solution with a high concentration of hydrogen ions is acidic. A solution with a low amount of hydrogen ions is basic, or also known as alkaline.Hydrogen ions, also known as hydronium, are written shorthand as H+ or H3O+.


Know the pH scale. The pH scale is from 1-13. The lower the number, the more acidic the solution. The higher the number, the more basic the solution.For example, orange juice would have a pH of 2 because it is quite acidic. In contrast, bleach has a pH of 12 as it is quite basic.Numbers in the middle of the scale are often neutral, such as water, with a pH of 7.
One level of pH is a 10x difference. For example, when comparing pH 7 to pH 6, pH 6 is ten times more acidic than pH 7. Furthermore, pH 6 would be 100 times more acidic than pH 8.;
, The pH scale is calculated by a negative logarithm. A negative logarithm is simply how many times a number must be divided.The pH equation can be seen as follows: pH = -log.


The equation can sometimes be seen as pH = -log. Know that whether the equation has H3O+ or H+, they are the same.
It is not vital to have a firm understanding of what a negative log is to calculate pH. Most calculators used at high school and post secondary level will have a log button.
 Concentration is the number of particles of a compound in a solution.Concentration is commonly described in molarity. That is, moles per unit of volume (m/v or M). If youâ€™re using a solution in a lab, the concentration will be written on the bottle. When working on your chemistry homework, the concentration will usually be given to you.

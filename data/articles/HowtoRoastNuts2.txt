 The stovetop method is quick, but can easily burn the nuts if you're not careful. Use a cast iron skillet or another heavy-bottomed pan that heats up slowly and evenly. Add the nuts in a single layer, leaving plenty of space to stir them.


There is no need to add oil.
 The nuts will turn light brown and release a strong aroma as they toast. This only takes a couple minutes for most nuts.Brazil nuts, walnuts, and other large nuts may take longer.


You can roast nuts in the shell, but it will take longer â€” roughly ten minutes.
 Nuts will quickly burn if you leave one side touching the pan for too long. Stir often to roast the nuts as evenly as you can. When roasting small pieces such as pine nuts or chopped nuts, stir or toss constantly.
 Pour the nuts into a bowl as soon as they turn a light golden brown. They will become crunchier as they cool. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge.

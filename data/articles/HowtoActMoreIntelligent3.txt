 One of the best ways to improve your intelligence is to read a variety of different things. Reading non-fiction, including books, magazines, and newspapers, gives you facts that build your base of knowledge. Readers are also more likely to be good at solving problems and finding meaningful patterns.This includes fiction as well. Fictional works can help improve your pattern-finding too. Plus, reading fiction can improve your emotional intelligence, that is your ability to read and respond to other people’s feelings.
 You probably already know a lot of facts and other information, but sometimes have trouble recalling it. Find ways to work on improving your fact recall, such as writing down information when you learn it the first time.When learning new information, find ways to associate it with other, easier to remember, things. Try to use or develop acronyms (using first letters to create words, like “ROY G. BIV” for the colors of the rainbow) or acrostics (using first letters to create sentences, like “Every Good Boy Does Fine” for lines of a treble music staff).
 Find people smarter than you are, and try to spend time with them. These people will be able to share their knowledge with you, even if it is just showing you better ways to learn things. It can be tough on your confidence at times, but it will help you remind yourself that there are always things you can learn., Rather than reading the same books or watching the same TV shows, look for something new and different. Visit a museum, see a music group, or even do something adventurous like hiking. People tend to think those who experience more diverse events are more intelligent. This will also give you good stories to tell about looking at art or listening to new and interesting things.

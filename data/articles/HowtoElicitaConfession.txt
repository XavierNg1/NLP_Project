 If you are a cop, teacher, coach etc. then you have some kind of "big stick" that will encourage cooperation.;
, Kojak was a TV cop who appeared marginally competent, thus throwing suspect off their guard.


,,, You can even tell them you just have to get this down and turn it in.
 If you're a cop, ask them when they first saw the kid (or whatever), what they said, what they were wearing etc. Work your way slowly, toward the heart of the matter.
 Before I ask you any more questions, let me tell you what is going to happen. This is your one chance to tell the truth. What I say is going into my report and will be read by the (Judge, Principal etc.) If they find out later that you actually did this thing, but you lied about it, things will be much worse for you.
 "Now lets talk for a minute about right and wrong. If you made a mistake, that was wrong, but you are human. People make mistakes. Now is your chance to make it right. You have an obligation to yourself, your family and this community to do that. If you do that now, I can help you. If you lie to me and it is found out, and IT WILL BE, you will be in much worse shape".
 By the time you get to the next step, your face should be the only thing they see. There is nothing else, no distractions, no way out but to deal with you.
 Don't ask for the whole enchilada right away. Say something like, Now I know you touched her, didn't you?" Usually you will at least get an admission.
 Don't let them narrate. The narrative gives them too many chances to be evasive.
 "Next, you felt her rear end, right?", just working your way through each issue.
 If you didn't you would be in trouble with your boss. Congratulate them for doing right.

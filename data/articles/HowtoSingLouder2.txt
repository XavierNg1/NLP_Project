 When you’re performing and nervous, it’s natural to get a bit quieter. Before you perform, practice your songs until you can sing them without even thinking about it. Knowing you're prepared can give you the confidence you need to sing loudly and clearly. It may even calm your nerves.Be sure to select songs that work with your vocal range. If you're unsure whether a song will work with your range, ask your vocal coach for feedback.
 While breathing exercises will strengthen your muscles and open up your lungs for full breaths, avoid taking deep breaths and holding them. When you're nervous about singing, just try to breathe normally. Stay relaxed so you're not creating tension.Practice your breathing before you begin singing. Do something simple like count your breaths in and out. For example, breathe in for five counts and release for five counts. Continue doing this until you're calm and ready to sing.
 Remind yourself why you want to sing. Chances are, if you keep your mind on your love for singing, you'll overcome your anxiety and be able to sing loudly and clearly.

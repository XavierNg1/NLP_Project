 They help neutralize the gastric acid that can cause GERD symptoms. Widely available at grocery stores and pharmacies, antacids like Tums and Rolaids are a quick and easy way to feel better. Keep in mind, however, that they only last a few hours, so long-lasting GERD symptoms might need something different. Read the label of your chosen antacid carefully to get the right dosage. Take the tablet or pill only after the heartburn or acid reflux has kicked in., H2 blockers are available both over-the-counter and as a prescription. Pepcid and Zantac are common over-the-counter varieties, and can last significantly longer than a chewable antacid like Tums or Rolaids.They help your stomach stop producing acid (the cause of acid reflux). Doctors sometimes prescribe both an antacid and an H2 blocker, to first neutralize and then stop the acid that causes GERD symptoms. H2 blockers come in both chewable and pill form, and you typically take them as you begin to feel the symptoms of GERD., PPIs, or Proton Pump Inhibitors, are prescription drugs that help your stomach stop producing acid. They can also help in healing your esophagus, if your GERD has advanced to the point that it is damaged. Keep in mind, however, that PPIs are not recommended for long-term use.

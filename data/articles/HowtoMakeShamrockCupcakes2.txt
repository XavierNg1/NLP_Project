Put a cupcake liner into each muffin pan hole.
Put a marble between the cupcake case and the pan in three places, one marble at the top and two to each side. The cupcake case will be squeezed into a Y shape.
 Follow the package instructions., Add a drop or two and mix. Keep adding drops until you're happy with the green color., This is quite tricky and piping is likely to be easiest., Bake for 15 minutes or until the cake springs back when touched (or stick a toothpick in and if it comes out clean, it's ready)., Let cool in the pan, to help retain their shape. When cooled, pull out the marbles first, to release the cupcakes from the pan. Trim off any excess cake that didn't cook into the Shamrock shape.

The marbles can be cleaned by a simple soapy wash.
 When you're happy with the green color, it's ready to use.,,, Done!

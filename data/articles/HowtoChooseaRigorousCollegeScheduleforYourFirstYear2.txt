 This doesn't mean slacking off. Rather, it means taking into account that you will be new to the school and settling in. It takes a little time to get used to the rigors of your chosen major, and possibly also to living on your own. Doing a little less in the first term can give you the space you need to set up efficiently and to be prepared for the future overload terms.
 For example, if you need calculus before you can take physics, try to take calculus right away.
 Feed these into your schedule first, so that the other classes can be worked in around these classes.
 A class about literature or history may have a lot of reading and writing, including term papers. A class like chemistry or physics will have problem sets for homework and perhaps labs and lab reports. These different kinds of homework require you to use different skills and study methods and possibly require different amounts of time. That's not a bad thing, just something to keep in mind as you choose your schedule.

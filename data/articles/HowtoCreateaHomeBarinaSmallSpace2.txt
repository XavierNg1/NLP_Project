 When you have limited space, you can’t stock your bar with every liquor available. Choose a variety of liquor so guests have options, but remember you will be the one most often using the bar. Stock one kind of the basic alcohols, including vodka, rum, gin, tequila, and whiskey.Wine and beer are also good to have on hand, but may need to be kept chilled.
A small space won’t allow you to have four or five kinds of every type of alcohol. One of each, or two of some, is enough to give people multiple drink options.
 While some people take their alcohol straight, others prefer to cut their alcohol with something gentler or mix cocktails. Club soda, orange or cranberry juice, tonic water, 7 Up, and Coke are common mixers to have on hand.If necessary, you can store these in the kitchen and only set them out when necessary.
Since some mixers must be kept cold and don’t last a long time, you don’t need to always keep these stocked. Buy them when you know you have guests coming over.
 Different alcohols are traditionally served in different glassware. Beer is often served in a mug or pilsner glass. Whiskey is served in a short rocks glass. Cocktails are often served in tall glasses. Include an efficient selection of glassware in your home bar. You don’t need a dozen of every glass, but stock at least a few of each.It also depends on how often you entertain guests and how many there are likely to be. For personal use, one glass each of five or six types is plenty. Store extras for guests somewhere else and only get them out when you need to.

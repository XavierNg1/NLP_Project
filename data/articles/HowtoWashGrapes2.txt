 In a clean bowl, pour three parts clean water. Add one part vinegar to the water. This is the most effective concentration to remove bacteria and pesticides.Use water that is close to the temperature of the grapes.
 Place your grapes in the water and vinegar solution. Allow them to sit in the solution for 5-10 minutes.This solution clears away pesticides and about 98% of bacteria on fruits.Use a spray bottle to clean off grapes if you donâ€™t want to soak them.
 Empty the vinegar and water solution from the bowl. Then rinse your grapes in cold, running water for thirty seconds. This can wash off any lingering bacteria or residue. It also removes the residual flavor of vinegar., Set your grapes on a clean dishtowel or a paper towel. Air dry them for about ten minutes before eating or storing them.

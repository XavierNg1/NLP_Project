 The first thing someone will see when you're walking around Bearville are you clothes. Try to choose colours that go well together.;
, Whatever your style, you can find something you like in the Bear Stuff Store, or Bearville Outfitters.
 This will help you organise your time. Some things you may want to include are: playing the Furtastic Fountain, tending to your plants, taking the 100% Pawsome test, working shifts at the Coffee Shop, Bank and Mall and teaching or studying at the Bear University. All of these things will help you earn Bearbills as well, so they are worth doing!

, The limit on Bearville is 200 friends. Try to make friends with boys and girls and people with different interests and hobbies to mix things up.
 This way you can help people and be a good citizen. You can also buy different things from the JrCybearGuide Catalog, and try to become JrCybearGuide of the Month! Give tours for new citizens as well, because it really helps them out.
 Whenever you log in to Bearville you can read the Bearville Times. Watch the Chloe Show whenever it is on. You can also read Paws Fur Nature in the Library. If you answer the quiz questions at the back correctly you can get a different item every season.
 Remember that people may think differently about things to you, but their opinion is worth listening to! Trade with other people, but make sure you are fair.
 There is a tab with 'CBZ' at the bottom of your screen which takes you to your very own CyBearZone! Check out all the different options, including the style of your Zone, music, status and quests! Look at your 'to-do' list every day and try to complete the different tasks!

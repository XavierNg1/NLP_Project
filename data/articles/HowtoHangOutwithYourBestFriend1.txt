 A movie night in with your best pal is a classic and affordable way to reconnect. Half of the fun is picking out the movie and deciding on a comedy, horror, action, or drama piece. Make sure you don’t spend so long debating on which movie to watch that you run out of time to actually watch it.

Don’t forget the snacks. Make flavored popcorn for a traditional movie treat or order take-out if you’re hungrier.
Instead of a movie you can also marathon a tv show together.;
, It doesn’t matter if you don’t consider yourselves to be great cooks, you can still have fun figuring out a recipe together. Either you manage to create an amazing dish, or fail miserably and have a source of laughter and entertainment. Pick out a recipe and go shopping for the ingredients together to make a whole day of it., Arts and crafts doesn’t just have to bring up memories of pasty kindergarten fingers and construction paper. Make cards for upcoming holidays or birthdays, or put together some wall art for your new room or apartment. Let your inner child loose and be creative.Try something challenging like glass blowing or welding. Ask around at art shops in your area for classes available to the public.Not only does working in one of these studios provide excitement, you also get to walk away with a keepsake to remember the experience by.
 Dusting furniture and mopping floors is rarely fun when you’re by yourself. But crank up the music with your best friend and start dancing your chores to completion. You’ll feel both productive and cheerful when accompanied by a companion.

If necessary, bribe them with baked goods in return for their help with your janitorial tasks.
Return the favor and help clean their house the next week. Helping each other with the weekly chores list can help the tasks feel less mundane.

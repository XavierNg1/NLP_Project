 You can harvest the small shoots that begin to grow in early spring. Simply cut them off at the soil before they reach 8 inches (20 cm) tall. Any taller than this and they will become fibrous and tough. Cut off the outer leaves and eat the tender inner portion. You can eat daylily shoots raw on their own, or dip them into a veggie dip, such as ranch, to give more flavour.Cutting back daylily shoots will not prevent the plant from growing. The roots will continue producing new shoots.;
, This will help to mask their strong aftertaste. Chop up the daylily shoots and then mix together a variety of vegetables, such as mixed greens, tomato, cucumber, and celery. Add daylily shoots to the salad and then top with your favourite dressing, such as oil and vinegar or balsamic vinaigrette., Daylily shoots are very tasty when saut√©ed in oil with other vegetables. You could try adding daylily shoots to your next stir fry. Cook the daylilies in olive oil with tamari and garlic. Then add other vegetables, such as broccoli, squash, peppers, and onions and serve them over a bed of rice or noodles.You could also try adding a protein source, such as chicken, beef, or shrimp.

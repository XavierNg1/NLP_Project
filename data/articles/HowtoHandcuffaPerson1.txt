 It’s difficult and inadvisable to handcuff someone who is actively resisting. Before beginning to handcuff an uncooperative suspect, concentrate on controlling them first. If you can’t restrain them with your hands or body it might be best to step back and use a non-lethal method to subdue them, such as a Taser or an expandable baton. Always be ready for resistance, even if the suspect seems to be cooperative. If you are within six feet of a suspect you need to act as if you are anticipating a struggle. Speak confidently, keep your grip on firm, and apply the handcuffs swiftly. ;
, If your suspect can’t see the actual process of handcuffing they are unlikely to resist in an effective way. This means handcuffing them from behind while facing a wall or other large object.


Try to avoid handcuffing a person directly against an object like a wall or car. If they decide to resist, it will give them a surface to leverage against and they may injure themselves or you.
 Stand with your feet slightly parted and knees slightly bent so that you can keep your balance in the face of an assault. If your suspect begins violently resisting and you aren’t properly balanced they may knock you over, resulting to injury in yourself and the possible loss of your suspect.


While keeping your balance, try to limit theirs. Have the suspect spread their feet apart and bend slightly forward, or handcuff them while they’re kneeling on the ground.
 Handcuffs should be stored in a loaded position, meaning that the shackle jaw should be pushed through the ratchet in the body of the cuff until it's almost through. Check that the double lock is not already engaged––this should only be operated after cuffing.


Be knowledgeable about your handcuffs. Always read the manual in advance so that you will know the information you need to know. There are several kinds of handcuffs so you need to be familiar with your own.

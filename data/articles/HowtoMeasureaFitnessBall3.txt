 If you don't have the ball's packaging, check the ball itself; the intended size is often printed near the air valve or on the ball's "equator."

, Use a yardstick or tape measure and make sure this distance is exact. The box you use should measure at least as high as your fitness ball.
 If it passes through without brushing either, it's underinflated. When correctly inflated, the edges of the ball should just graze the box and the wall.


If you don't know the ball's intended diameter but need to know its actual size, place the ball against the wall. Position the box so that it just touches the opposite side of the ball. Then remove the ball, and measure from the box to the wall to calculate the ball's diameter.
 Alternatively, you can use your ball’s height to determine whether it’s inflated correctly. Use painter’s tape and make a mark on your wall at the same height as the fitness ball’s diameter. Then, inflate your fitness ball until it’s level with this mark.


The diameter of your fitness ball is the same as its height.

 Hold down the Option key while you click the Firefox icon to open it in Safe Mode.If a "Profile Manager" window opens, select your profile, and hold Option again while clicking OK or a similar button.
 The step above is usually enough, but you can try this method if all else fails. Open Terminal, located in Applications → Utilities → Terminal.
 Type /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -safe-mode and hit enter on your keyboard. If you get an error message, make sure you have typed in the command exactly as it appears.


Your cursor and keyboard commands will not work in Terminal. To correct a mistake, use the arrow keys or delete on your keyboard.

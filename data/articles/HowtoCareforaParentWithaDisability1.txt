 Let them know that you are willing to take over care when their disability or future disabilities make it impossible for them to live completely independently. Set up a plan of care with them, if possible.;
, Some disabilities are gradual, especially those associated with aging. The following are some ways that disabilities can appear:


Watch for signs that parents can no longer handle their daily routines. Failure to shower, wash clothing, brush teeth or eat well is usually a sign of mental or physical problems. Also, look for signs that they are unable to keep up with housework may show that they need assistance in the home.
Evaluate how your parents are driving. Look for signs of confusion, failure to see or motor vehicle accidents. Failing sight, dementia and loss of muscle or nerve control will dictate when it is time for them to stop driving.
Look for signs that your parents risk injury at home. Stairs, icy conditions, slippery showers and other hazards can give you warning that a parent is losing some mobility. A change in living conditions, aides or living situation may be necessary.
Keep track of memory loss. Disabilities can be mental as well as physical. If your parent forgets appointments, has trouble speaking or cannot follow directions, then assistance in a daily routine may be necessary.

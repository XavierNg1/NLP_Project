 How often should this be done? According to DICOR (A leading manufacturer of EPDM roofing material) all that is necessary to maintain your warranty is a required periodic cleaning at least 3 to 4 times per year.;
, Whether a person goes up on an EPDM roof once a year, or four times a year, a rubber roof will require a good inspection on a regular basis. Keeping it clean will allow you to do a more thorough inspection. If you cannot see the surface of your rubber roof due to dirt and grime, it is time to clean it.
, This will save you a lot of clean up later.
, You should work on one 2 to 3 sq ft area at a time.
, Rinse this dirty mop in a bucket of clean water.
,, This can occur anywhere there is a penetration like the air conditioner, various vents, etc. Even small pin-holes can be a problem that will allow water penetration.
, Cut off the tip making an opening of approximately 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).
 Allow time for it to seek its own level.


This is not as complex as it sounds, cleaning and inspecting the roof on a regular bases will allow you to become familiar with the normal condition of your roof. So, the odd things will start to jump out at you.






The black mold spots that grow over time on this roof are not a major concern. Just clean them off with the above mentioned rubber roof cleaner, and if you want, put a coating of UV (ultra-violet) protectant on. The stuff looks like white paint, and give it a nice finish… just make sure that ANY coating applied directly to the EPDM does not contain any petroleum distillates. This stuff really messes with EPDM. EPDM will blister and this will allow water to seep in to the newly exposed wood sub frame.
 They will make sure you have the correct cleaning material. Just make sure that it does not have ANY petroleum distillates in it.

 Short nails have less of a chance of chipping quickly, as they don't come in contact with as much on a daily basis. For instance, short nails don't come in constant contact with computer keys while typing.
 If you can't avoid an activity that you know might damage your nails, protect them if you can. For example, if you need to wash dishes, be sure to wear dish washing gloves while you do it.
 Biting your nails will destroy your nail polish immediately. While it's hard to break the habit of biting your nails, if you don't you won't have a beautiful coat of nail polish for long.
 The spots where you apply small bits of polish to fill in any chips will not be as smooth or pretty as the rest of your polish, but they will help preserve the rest of your nail polish from chipping off.


This is basically a last ditch effort to save your manicure. If you can, when a coat of polish starts chipping off, simply take it off with remover and start over.
 If you have a small chip on the tip of your nail, simply file your nail down and then apply another layer of top coat, focusing on the tip of your nail.

You can also paint a thin layer of a contrasting color of nail polish all along the edge of your nail, like a thin french manicure.You will need a steady hand but the result will look cute and intentional.
 This will also make your nail polish shiny and beautiful once again without the hassle of totally reapplying it.

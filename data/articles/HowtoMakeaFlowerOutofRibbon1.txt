 Check the dollar store before you purchase your materials online or an arts and crafts store. Make sure you know exactly how many flowers you will need in order to budget how much material you will need to purchase. Grosgrain is a heavy ribbon with a corded texture that is usually made of rayon or cloth silk. To create grosgrain ribbon flowers you will need:


22 inches of ¾ inch wide grosgrain ribbon. Grosgrain ribbon comes in a variety of colours.
⅛ inch pearls or beads. The number of beads will vary depending on their diameter.
Thread to match the colour of the grosgrain ribbon.
Brooch pin or barrette and hot glue (optional);
, Cut 4 pieces of ribbon that each measure 5 ½ inches long. Create a loop with each piece by folding with the ends meeting in the center. The loop will measure 2 ½ inches long while there will be a ¼ inch overlap of ribbon at the center., Hold each loop in place with a pin and create two crosses by pinning two pieces of ribbon at their center and repeat with the two remaining pieces of ribbon., Stitch the four pieces of ribbon together with matching coloured thread. The eight loops should look like eight petals once you’ve stitched the two crosses together.Your stitching should resemble a box at the center point at which the two crosses come together. The box makes sure that the loops do not come loose and your flower remains secure.
 Ensure that the bead hole won’t be visible as you loop the thread through it. Begin at the center and continue outward to create a circle of beads. Stitch another circle around the first. This will use twice as many beads.You only need to penetrate the first layer of ribbon as you stitch your beads or pearl.
The number of beads and pearls will vary depending on the diameter of the beads or pearls but generally you will be using about 5 - 7.
 If you are using the flower as a brooch or barrette, simply use a glue gun to add a clasping barrette pin to the back of the flower, opposite the pearls or beads.

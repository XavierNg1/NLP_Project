 Wash the chicken in water and drain well. Leave the skin on and bones in.;
, Use a large glass or stainless steel bowl and combine the soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, pepper, and tomatoes.


Break up the whole tomatoes with your hands in the bowl.
Add the chicken and submerge it almost completely in the mixture.
Cover lightly and refrigerate for about 18 to 24 hours.
 Pour the chicken and mixture into a non-stick, 4-quart (3.8 L) pot.


Bring to a gentle boil at about 212 degrees F (100 degrees C). Cover and let cook for 25 minutes or until the chicken’s center is 175 degrees F (80 degrees C). Use a meat thermometer to check the chicken’s temperature.
Move the chicken to a plate, using tongs.
 Skim as much fat as possible from the liquid as it cooks and increase heat. Boil the water down by half.



Heat the pan to medium-high or 375 to 450 degrees F (190-230 degrees C).Add the chicken, skin down, to brown for up to 8 minutes. Keep the pieces skin down, but move if necessary to keep the chicken from sticking to the pan.
Adjust heat so the chicken doesn’t burn. Internal temperature should be about 175 degrees.Watch for splatter!
Cook for up to about 8 minutes or until the chicken is a deep golden brown.
 When the chicken is a deep brown on one side, turn the pieces and add the onion slices around them. Continue to brown the chicken, and move around the onions to prevent burning.. Cook for 5-7 minutes or until the onions are tender., As soon as the chicken starts falling off the bones and the sauce starts to have a gravy-like consistency, you are ready to serve. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the chicken and onions to your serving bowl. Pour the boiled-down juices over the chicken and onions.


Enjoy with white rice.
Serve with pinot noir or red zinfandel. For a non-alcoholic option, consider ice tea, lemonade, or ginger beer.

 Anytime a review rubs you the wrong way, highlight a key sentence, copy it, and paste it into your search engine. If you see this exact sentence popping up on a number of other review sites (even if it is for different products), this can indicate the review is a fake., If a reviewer includes any kind of link to purchase a product or coupon code, discard it immediately. Whether they are promoting the product they are reviewing, or promoting a different product to purchase instead, such links and codes are definitive red flags., Reviews with either 1-star or 5-star ratings are the most likely to be falsified. If you read mostly 2-4 star reviews, you will eliminate a lot of the guesswork and encounter more genuine reviews.

 Open your web browser, type in www.mail.google.com on the address bar, and hit "Enter."


On the Gmail page, log in with your username and password on the provided fields.
 Once you’re logged in, go to your inbox by clicking on it on the left menu panel of the window.


Web e-mail providers basically have a common layout, with the menu panel on the left pane.
 Once you’re inside the inbox, click on the message with the attachment you want to save.


Messages with attachments have the paper clip icon beside it.
 On the current interface of Yahoo mail, go to the body of the e-mail message and scroll down. All files attached to a message are listed at the bottom of the body.


In Google Mail, all the attachments have thumbnails, regardless if it’s a document file or an image.
 Two buttons will appear on it: a Down Arrow icon and the Google Drive icon.
 Just click the Down arrow on the thumbnail and the browser will begin downloading the file.
 Wait for the download to finish, and then open your computer’s Download folder (located inside your My Documents folder) to view the saved attachment.

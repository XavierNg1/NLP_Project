 These dolphins are smaller than the Common Dolphin. They only grow to 2m in length and have a two-tone dorsal fin.
, These dolphins can be seen behaving boisterously, even for dolphins, all around New Zealand's coast except for the west coast of the North Island. They can perform spectacular somersaults and body slams. In Maori the Dusky Dolphin is called Papahau.

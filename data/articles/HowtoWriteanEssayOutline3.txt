 This section should include an attention getting opening and general information about your topic. The information you provide in your introduction outline should gradually become more specific as you progress through its subsections.The last subsection of your introduction outline should be your thesis statement.Under the first sub-point, write a sentence that introduces the essay topic while also grabbing the reader's attention. A shocking fact or anecdote is a great way to start. The second sub-point should describe the topic, history of the issue, background, or problem being explored. Keep this section brief, but include the information that your readers will need to know in order to understand your paper. The final sub-point should be your thesis statement. State the idea or argument that you plan to discuss in your essay. , The body of your essay should be the largest part of your essay, so you will want to devote at least three subsections to this portion of your outline.


Do not label each point as "main point." Instead, directly write out the point being explored.
Under each main point, you should write supporting evidence to back the point up. Give each piece of supporting evidence its own line and sub-section.
If desired, you could also include a sentence that transitions into your next major point at the end of each "main idea" section. This is not strictly necessary, though.
 This section should return the reader to the general discussion brought up in the "introduction" portion.


Restate your thesis first. Do not copy your original thesis statement word-for-word. Instead, restate the idea, but rephrase it in a new way.
Make a concluding statement. A concluding statement will usually discuss the implications of the thesis, propose solutions to problems addressed in the essay, or explain the importance of the thesis to something outside of the range of the essay.

 Be sure to use conditioner, and to rinse out as much of it as possible afterward. This makes the hair soft and shiny, and helps it to hold its shape. Use a towel to dry the pony until her hair is only a little damp.;
, Use pins to hold the hair in place (but be careful not to poke or scratch your pony!).
 Then wrap it in a strip of paper towel, and pin it as you did the mane. If you want to curl the pony's bangs as well, curve them against her cheek and use a strip of paper towel and a rubber band to hold them in place.
 In the morning, you can remove the strips of towel. Unwind her tail from around her leg, but be careful to keep the curl intact. If the hair seems a little stiff, just smooth it with your fingers or run a comb over it lightly.Â Now you have a pony with shiny, beautiful hair!

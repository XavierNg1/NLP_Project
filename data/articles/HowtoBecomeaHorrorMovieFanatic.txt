 After that, make a list of all the scary movies you've heard of, but haven't watched yet. Keep these lists in a journal or notebook. To become a true horror fan, you're going to have to see a lot of movies.;
,, This website has reviews from the best critics. Go through your list and search for the movies you want to see.
 Then watch the low-budget films last. This should be your priority.
 For example, you could watch five horror movies a day on the weekends, and on school or work days you could watch one or two when you come home, or once your homework is done.
 If one video link doesn't load or has crappy quality, keep trying other links, and if you can't watch the movie online, find another way to see it. Rent it from a video store, Netflix if you have it, or order pay-per-view.
 Take quizzes online and get to know your trivia.
 True fanatics own all their favorite slasher films! Remember, you don't have to buy these movies brand new—you could always illegally download them to your computer and burn them onto DVDs but you might get caught—and the fines are stiff, or search yard sales and thrift stores, or maybe find them craigslist. You can trade with other enthusiasts, too.


If you really want to be obsessed—and if you aren't on too strict of a budget—buy horror-related merchandise: Friday the 13th t-shirts, a Chucky doll, just anything that you enjoy.

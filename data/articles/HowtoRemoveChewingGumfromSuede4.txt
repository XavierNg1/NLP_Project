 White vinegar is one of the only few liquids that is safe to use on suede. Take a towel, cotton balls or Q tips and add a few drops of water to moisten. Dab gently at the gum remains to move. Then carefully add a few drops of white vinegar. Wait a couple minutes until it dries and then brush over with a suede brush. Never use water to clean suede. It seems counterintuitive, but water is actually damaging to suede and can stain it. Remember to dab, don't scrub!

, Windex is another substance that is safe to use on suede. Like with vinegar, use only a few drops of windex on a clean towel or Q tip and dab at the gum. If there is no effect, you can try adding a few more drops of windex to your towel or Q tip.
 There are some sprays made specifically to clean suede. If you still have remains of gum on your suede item, you may consider buying and using one of these sprays. They can be found at major stores like Walmart or Target Don't confuse suede cleaner spray with suede waterproofing spray. A cleaning spray will help you with your gum problem, while a waterproofing spray is meant to protect suede from water damage.

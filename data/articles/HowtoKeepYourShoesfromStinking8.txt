 Cedar has anti-fungal properties and is often used to deodorize clothes. The insoles would stay in your shoes, while the chips would need to be inserted at night and removed in the morning.
 Odor-controlling insoles can be cut to fit the shape of your sole, and come in several different colors. These work well for sandals, high heels or open-toed shoes.


Secure the insole with small strips of double-sided tape or dabs of rubber cement. These will help the insole stay in place while keeping it easily removable.
 Linings containing silver are anti-microbial and can inhibit the growth of odor-causing bacteria.
 Simply place a couple of dryer sheets in your shoes while you use them. These instantly deodorize the smell.

 It may sound highly unnecessaryÂ but in order to improve in future battles, you should spend time thinking about what you think worked really well in battle, and what you think you could improve on. Try thinking of techniques based off of what other players used, including your enemies, that could help you win next battle. This is a good idea, even if you lost your previous battle., After you've played 20 battles, you should consider letting yourself rest. This way, you can let your fingers, neck, and eyes relax. You can calm down after being so worked up over the battle. You can even help avoid an epileptic episode, due to Splatoon's bright, flashy colors.

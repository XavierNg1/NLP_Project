 When a receiving player fumbles the ball, the player must still touch the wall before another player is able to throw the ball, however, if the ball gets to the wall before he does, he gets a strike and continues playing until he gets her third strike. Allowing each player to have 3 strikes extends the game if you play until everyone is out except for the winner., When a person receives a strike, you may penalize him by making him place his hands on the wall while the other players each get a turn at throwing the ball at his butt. Only allow one throw per person and only allow players to throw at the butt because itâ€™s very unlikely the player will get injured., For advanced players, you can add bonus points or penalties for things like one handed catches, one footed catches, using your left hand to throw or catch, etc. If a rule is broken you can penalize a person or reward a player for pulling off a difficult trick.


For example, you can evoke the rule of only catching with your left hand. If your opponent uses his right hand to catch then he gets penalized with a strike or butts up.
 Speed up the game by removing any bounces. Players must move closer to the wall and be ready for the fast pace of back and forth. Be careful as the quickened play can become dangerous as players try to cover their ground.

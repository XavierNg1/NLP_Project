 Research papers can come from science or the Humanities, so whatever your topic is about, narrow it down a bit to give the readers of your paper a clue about what part of the sciences or Humanities you'll be focusing on. Some examples could include:


"Dedicated scholars have been studying language and culture in parallel ever since the connection between the two was first established."
"Throughout the 20th century, our views of life on other planets has drastically changed."

, If your research paper is complex and deals with a lot of different material, it could be helpful to spell out in your introduction where you research paper will go for the rest of the paper. This will help the reader structure the basic argument of your research paper before s/he reads it, ultimately making it easier to understand.
 Usually toward the end, include a clear thesis that is supported by evidence if possible. Because research papers rely on evidence so heavily, putting this front and center will help bolster your argument.

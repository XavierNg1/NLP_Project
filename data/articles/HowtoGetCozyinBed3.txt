You do not want to have to get out of bed to get things you may need during the day or night. You may want to keep a glass of water, tissues, medicine, and some honey (to soothe your throat) on your nightstand. Also, put other items you may want such as books or magazines on your nightstand.If you do not have room on your nightstand, put all of your medicines in a plastic box that you keep near your bed., A wedge pillow will support your back, neck, and shoulders while you are in bed.

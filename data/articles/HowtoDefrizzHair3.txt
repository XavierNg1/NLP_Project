 This will help to remove static and frizz. Keep in mind that it isnâ€™t a permanent solution. It will help to remove flyaway hairs in a pinch though.
 You only need a few drops in your hand, even smaller than dime sized. Rub the oil through your hair but not your scalp while your hair is still wet. This is another quick fix that can help your hair look more smooth and sleek., You should be able to find a bristle brush and dry oil at your local pharmacy. Oil acts as a barrier to liquids, which can lead to frizz.


Brush the oil into your hair from the ends to midway through the hair shaft while your hair is still wet. Once your hair is dry, finish by brushing the oil into the rest of your hair.

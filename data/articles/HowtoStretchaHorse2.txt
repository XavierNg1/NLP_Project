 Stand to the side of your horse, and cue them to lift one of their front legs. Pull it forward so that it is fully extended with little-to-no bend in the knee, and the hoof close to the ground. Hold their leg in this position for 10-15 seconds, or as long as your horse is able., Standing to the side of the front legs again, cue your horse to lift one of their front legs. Pick it up and bring it forward, with a little bend in the knee. Then, hold their leg just under their knee and lift it up so that it has a 90 degree angle bend, while the lower half of the leg is hanging freely. Rotate this leg in a circular motion 3-5 times in the direction of the other leg., Move to your horse’s backside and stand facing one of their back legs. Cue them to lift their leg, and keep the hoof extended outwards (the same way you would if you were going to pick it). Hold the lower half of their leg, and slowly extend it backwards and downwards. Hold this stretch for 10-15 seconds., Ask your leg to pick up their foot as you stand next to them, and grab it just below the knee. Pull their leg forwards a bit and slightly diagonally without losing all the bend in their knee. Hold this stretch for 10-15 seconds and then slowly bring the horse’s leg back into the resting position.

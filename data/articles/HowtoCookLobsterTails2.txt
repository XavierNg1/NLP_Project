, In order to do this, you shouldn't rip the tail meat completely from the tail. Instead:









Cut the shell lengthwise with a knife or a pair of kitchen shears, starting at the head of the tail. Be careful not to cut completely down the length of the tail, leaving the tailflap (the very end of the lobster) and an inch of shell above it intact.
With your hands, pry the tail meat from the membranes in the shell. Start with the thickest meat at the head of the tail. Separate all meat from the shell except an inch or so near the tailflap.
Lift most of the meat out of the shell, close the shell under it, and let the meat rest on top of the shell. The tail meat should look like it's piggybacking on top of its own tail.
 Some ways that you could season the lobster include:









Olive oil, paprika, salt, and pepper.
Lemon juice, salt, pepper, and dill.
Butter, salt, and pepper.
 Cook approximately 1 1/2 minutes for each ounce of meat. This would mean:









An 8-ounce lobster tail would cook at 375° F for 12 minutes.
A 10-ounce lobster tail would cook at 375° F for 15 minutes.
A 12-ounce lobster tail would cook at 375° F for 18 minutes.
 Put a pat of butter on each tail,or brush melted butter on them, place at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) underneath the broiler, and cook, keeping a close eye on each lobster tail.

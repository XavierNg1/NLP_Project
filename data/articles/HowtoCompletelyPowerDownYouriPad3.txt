 This should be considered a last resort, since Recovery mode may force you to wipe the iPad and set it up as new.
 You'll need to use iTunes to complete the Recovery mode process.
 After about 10 seconds, you'll see the Apple logo.
 This will prompt iTunes to restore your device.
 iTunes will attempt to download the latest update and apply it without erasing any of your data.
 If the update takes longer than 15 minutes to download and install, you'll likely need to repeat the Recovery mode process and select "Restore" instead of "Update" in iTunes. This will wipe the iPad's data but should get it working again.
 After the restore process is finished, you'll be taken through the initial setup for the iPad as if it were new. Enter your Apple ID to restore your iCloud data. If you're connected to the computer with your iTunes library, you can restore any available iTunes backups.

 Into 1 cup (8 oz) of water, mix in just a teaspoon (5 g) of translucent dishwashing liquid. Spray this solution onto the stain generously.


Dawn or Joy works very well for this step, though most dish soaps will do., As with both previous methods, do not scrub the stain; that'll just set the stain further into the recesses of the carpet. Dab at it gently, in an up-and-down motion.
 Just like you did with the detergent, spray on a solution of 1 tablespoon (15 g) of ammonia in 1/2 cup of water. Blot the stain with a different, clean cloth.


If you don't have a spray bottle on hand, try to create a makeshift one from an old hairspray bottle or body spray. If not, do it the old fashioned way and drizzle it on.
 Then what do you do? You got it -- blot with a clean cloth. The stain's virtually gone, huh? Great!

, Basically, you're giving your carpet a wash after the ammonia-ridden torture it's just been through. Otherwise, you risk damaging your carpet if those chemicals stay put.
 To get all the ammonia, vinegar, and soap out of the carpet, rinse with clean water, blot it, and leave it to dry. If you come back to it and it's overly stiff, rinse it once more.


Run it through your fingers. How does it feel? Not perfect? Haul out the vacuum and go over it a few times -- that oughta do the trick.

 Fold the shirt so that only the sleeves overlap each other.;
, Take a Sharpie tracing on the edge from the bottom of the shirt all the way up to the collar. When you're done and you unfold each side of the shirt, it should form a column in the middle of your shirt.
 Your shirt should now have a strip missing. Put it on like you would a jacket and see if it's a good fit; determine how much you need to cut off to make it tighter or show more skin.
 You're shirt should be a little bit looser than you would like it. Cut off equal portions of the shirt without cutting the collar, so the strip is still connected to the shirt (unlessÂ you are using different string and not the shirt fabric, cut the strip all the way).
 Each dot should have another dot across from it, this is the corset pattern. Make as many holes as you desire, but don't cut one into the collar.
 Try not to make it too big, or too close to the edge, because it will be easier to rip and won't last as long.
 These are the strings for your corset.
 The strips may not be long enough, so you will need to sew on more fabric from the middle part you took out.

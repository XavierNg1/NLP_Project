 People with poor hygiene are more likely to develop a boil. Make sure to take showers regularly and give your entire body a good scrub with a sponge and soap. Keep your hair grease-free. When you have dirty skin, bacteria can much more easily stick to it and create an infection., When your immune system is in poor shape, you are more likely to develop an infection. Some diseases like diabetes can weaken your defense system against outer infection sources. AIDS is another condition that will favor an infection by crippling your immunity. If you underwent chemotherapy, or recently suffered an organ transplant, you will also be prone to develop boils. To boost your immune system:


Eat a diet that focuses on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Try to avoid saturated fats as much as possible.
Exercise three to four times a week and maintain a healthy weight.
Get plenty of sleep. The amount of sleep you need depends on your age, but you will generally want to shoot for around eight hours each night.
Wash your hands regularly to avoid picking up any bacteria.
 Spending each day with a person infected with bacteria will increase your chances of developing boils, because you will constantly be exposed to the microbe. Working in a hospital and having contact with pathogens will also increase the chances of you getting infected.
 Medications can predispose a person to boils. If you take immunosuppressant drugs such as corticosteroids, your immune system can dramatically become ineffective.

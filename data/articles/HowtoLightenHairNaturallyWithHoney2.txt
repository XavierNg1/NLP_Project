 You can use any conditioner you like, as long as its scent mixes well with honey. Stir the conditioner and honey in a bowl until they are thoroughly combined.


Store extra conditioner in an old conditioner bottle for later use.
Use the same ratio of honey to conditioner to make a larger batch.
 After you shampoo your hair, use the honey conditioner just as you would your normal conditioner. Distribute a small amount through your hair and rinse it out when you're finished.


Leave the conditioner in your hair for 5-10 minutes while you finish your shower for a greater lightening effect.
If your hair feels sticky after rinsing, decrease the amount of honey you use and increase the amount of conditioner.

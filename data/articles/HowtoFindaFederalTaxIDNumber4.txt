 Every W-2 a business sends to its employees lists its employer identification number (EID). Find a W-2 from any year and look in box "b", near the top left corner of the page. Any other tax documents the business has filed should also include the EID, usually near the top of the first page.


A business switches to a new EID if it goes bankrupt, changes ownership (for sole proprietorships or partnerships), or has a major change in organization (for instance, it incorporates or merges).Do not rely on forms from before one of these events.

 Connect them together. Cut doors through to each connected box. This makes several rooms in the clubhouse.
 Cut small pieces of paper, draw on them, and glue them on the side of the box.


You can even use magazines or print outs from the internet.
 This part is optional but makes a nice playing surface. Place felt down on the base of each room in the clubhouse. Either glue the felt or use self-adhesive felt sheeting and peel and stick.
 You can make it from scratch using small boxes or use existing doll furniture.

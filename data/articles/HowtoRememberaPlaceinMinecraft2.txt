 Lets say that you are lost in the Desert. Observe the surroundings around you. You may be lost for a couple days away from home. In a Desert, you will find Sand, Cacti, and a little bit of water.;
, Find everything around you that you think is needed to survive. If you are lost somewhere near the mountains, it is best for you to find Pig, or Cow in order to survive. You need food to eat.
 Think to yourself, have I been here before? Like for example, have you ever traveled to a Desert? If you are lost in the Mountains, find the tallest Mountain near and climb it. Once you reach the summit, look from afar. Maybe your base or home is near or far.

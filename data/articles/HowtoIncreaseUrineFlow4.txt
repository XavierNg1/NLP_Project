 If you have low flow, you may just be dehydrated. Men should drink around 13 cups of water and other fluids daily (about 3 liters), and women should aim for 9 cups (2.2 liters).Drink more if you sweat a lot, work out, or live in a hot climate. Water, juice, and tea count towards your fluids.


If your urine is scarce and dark, you may be dehydrated.
 Eating a high-salt diet can cause you to retain water, which limits how much you urinate. Decrease salt in your diet by avoiding fast food and processed food like chips and other snack-aisle items. Flavor your meals with herbs and spices instead of table salt.
 If you have a medical condition that makes your body hold onto extra water – like heart failure, for instance – your doctor may prescribe a diuretic. That’s a medication that increases how much you urinate. Diuretics should only be used for specific conditions, so discuss your urinary trouble with your doctor and ask if a diuretic is right for you.

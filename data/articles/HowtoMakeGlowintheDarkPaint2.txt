 Using a pair of pliers, break open the end of a non-toxic highlighter. Remove the felt strip from the center and discard the plastic highlighter casing.









Make sure that your highlighter glows under black lights. Test this by writing something on a piece of paper using your highlighter. Then, turn off the lights and hold the black light over it. You should see your test scribbles.
 Place a cup or jar in your sink. Slowly run water through the felt strip so that the yellow highlighter liquid runs into your cup. Turn off the water and stop when the felt is white.









You may need to do this for several highlighters in order to create enough highlighter water.
 Use 1/2 cup of white cornstarch. This will be the basis for your homemade glow in the dark paint.









This mixture will be pretty thin. The ratio should be equal parts cornstarch and highlighter water.
 Carefully pour in 1/2 cup of highlighter water and stir until the cornstarch completely dissolves.
 If you want to change the color of your paint, add a few drops of food coloring and stir. Add more food coloring till you achieve the desired color.









Consider pouring your paint into a few smaller containers. That way, you can create different colors using different food colors.
 This paint is pretty runny, so you may want to let it dry and paint on several layers. Extra layers will make the paint glow seem brighter and last longer.
 Turn off all the lights and make sure to close any blinds or shades. Turn on your UV-A blacklight in order to see your paint glow.

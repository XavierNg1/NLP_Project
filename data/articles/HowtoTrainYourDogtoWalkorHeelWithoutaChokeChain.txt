 Pulling a dog by the neck using a choke chain is incredibly uncomfortable. Also a tugging dog will deny itself oxygen when it's pulling on the lead. The harness fits under the front legs, across the chest and over the back. It will be much more comfortable for the dog and will give you more control. The lead should clip onto a ring in the middle of the back. There are also front-clip harnesses where the leash attaches at the middle of the dog's chest that can greatly reduce pulling.;
, This will lure your dog into following you around and, it will teach him to hold his head high, since he will be looking at you and the treats.


, (excitedly), treat him, and he will keep walking.
 until the dog is moving back towards you again and is at your side. At that time start walking forward again - the dog should be at your side and you should immediately praise and reward your dog.
 He will be happier with praise and a food or toy treat than he will be with any of those alone.
, If you hold the dog close to your side with a tight leash, it will be very difficult for the dog to learn to walk without pulling.
 Heel is a command that takes being tender, loving, and having patience. If your dog doesn't follow, do step three again, and if he does, but then starts pulling again say a soft yet stern "No Max", and continue.

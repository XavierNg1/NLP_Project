 Check your remote for a "PIP" button or read the instructions; most PIP TVs have a section devoted to its operation.;
, PIP works only when more than one source is connected to the TV (i.e. cable & satellite, cable & "over the air" -- free, using set-top antenna -- channels, etc.).
 With most TVs, pressing the "Input" or "Source" button on the remote will select from the various items you have plugged into the TV (again, satellite, cable, VCR).

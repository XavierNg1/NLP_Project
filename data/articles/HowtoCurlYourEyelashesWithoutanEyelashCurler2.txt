 Use one or two coats, depending on your preference. Don't wait until the mascara is dry to continue; it needs to be wet for the curl to hold.
 Hold it horizontally along your lash line and use it to push your lashes into a tight curl. You can also use an emery board or another long, thin instrument to curl your lashes upward.
 During this time your mascara will dry, helping your lashes maintain a curled shape., Use the warm setting, and be sure to hold the hair dryer at least six inches from your face. Gently heating and drying the mascara will help the curl stay in place longer.


Don't use the hottest setting on your hair dryer. The hot air could hurt your eyes.
You can skip this step if you're happy with the curl you achieve without using a hair dryer.
 Be patient as you hold the cotton swab in place. Don't release the lashes until the mascara has fully dried and the curl is set in place.

The area of a rectangle is a measurement of the two-dimensional space within the rectangle, or the number of square units within the rectangle.The formula used to find the area of a rectangle is A = l * w.
The formula used to find the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2 * (l + w)

In the above formulas, A stands for “area,” P stands for “perimeter,” l refers to the length of the rectangle, and w refers to the width of the rectangle.
 This will allow you to find the measurement of the missing side of your rectangle, whether it is the length or the width. Finding this missing piece of information will then allow you to calculate perimeter.


Because you multiply the length and width together to find the area, dividing the area by the width will give you the length. Likewise, dividing the area by the length will give you the width.
For example, A = 112 centimeter (44.1 in) squared, l = 14 centimeter (5.5 in)

A = l * w
112 = 14 * w
112/14 = w
8 = w



, Now that you have measurements for both the length and width, you can plug them into the formula for rectangular perimeter.


In this problem, you add length and width together first because this part of the equation occurs in parentheses.
According to the order of operations, you always do the part of the equation in parentheses first., Once you’ve added the length and width of your rectangle together, you can find its perimeter by multiplying by two. This takes into account the additional two sides of your rectangle.


You are able to find the perimeter of the rectangle by adding length and width and multiplying by two because the opposite sides of a rectangle are equal in length.
Both lengths of the rectangle are the same, and both widths are the same.
For example, P = 2 * (14 + 8) = 2 * (22) = 44 centimeter (17.3 in).

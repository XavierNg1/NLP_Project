 Cut the yuzu into quarters, squeeze out and set aside the juice, then remove the seeds and wrap them in cheesecloth. Remove the pulp and membranes from the peels. Place the pulp and membranes in a saucepan, pour in enough water to cover them, simmer for 10 minutes, then strain out the water. While they're cooking, slice the peels thinly, then simmer them for 10 minutes and strain., One yuzu is typically about 2.5 ounces (71 g), so 24 yuzu would be around 60 ounces (1.7 kg). Measure enough granulated sugar to equal half the weight of your yuzu. If you have 60 ounces (1.7 kg) of yuzu, you'd use 30 ounces (850 g) of sugar., In a large saucepan, combine the prepared yuzu peel, membrane, pulp, juice, and sugar. Add just enough water to cover the ingredients and place the cheesecloth-wrapped seeds on top.Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.
When finished, you can transfer the warm marmalade to sterilized jars, seal them and store for up to a year.

 Cats can be trained, so if you are persistent, this may eventually be enough to permanently drive them away.


Be gentle when you are spraying cats with a water hose. Most cats do not like water, so a quick, gentle squirt is usually enoughâ€”there is no need for high-powered nozzles, or to thoroughly soak the intruding cats.
 When a cat walks by, the motion triggers the sprinkler, which sprays a burst of water. Most cats do not like getting wet, so this can often be an effective deterrent. Use motion-activated sprinklers to create a border around your garden.


These sprinklers can be installed either permanently or temporarily, depending on your preference and needs.
 These emit a high-frequency sound that cats detest, but which humans cannot hear.These devices are motion-activated, so that when a cat walks by, it is startled by the high-frequency sound and should leave the area. Look for ultrasonic devices at a pet supply store, and use them to create a barrier around your garden.
 Cats will not linger in areas they do not feel are safe from predators. For this reason, a dog that chases cats can effectively keep them out of your garden.

 Add 2 1/2 cups (625 ml) cold water, 1 cup (250 ml) freekeh, 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt, and 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) olive oil to a medium or large saucepan.


Mix slightly to spread the salt and olive oil and moisten all the grains of freekeh.
You can use cracked grain or whole grain. The latter takes longer to cook, but either one will work.
Make sure that the saucepan has a lid.
The contents of the saucepan should take up half to three-quarters of the total volume. If the pan is much fuller than that, the water might boil over.
Make sure that you use cool to cold water. Cool water will heat more evenly, so the grains of freekeh will cook more evenly, as well.
Note that if the instructions on your box or bag of freekeh differ, it is advisable to use the instructions provided on the container rather than these.
 Use a mixing spoon to stir the contents of the saucepan occasionally as they come up to temperature. Once the liquid starts to boil, cover the pan with its lid.


The lid is necessary because it traps the steam inside. This prevents the water from evaporating, leaving it nowhere to go but into the grains of freekeh.
 Lower the heat to low or medium-low and let the grains simmer until the grains become tender. For cracked grain freekeh, this should take about 10 to 15 minutes. For whole grain freekeh, this should take 40 to 45 minutes.


Stir the grains periodically during the process to promote even cook and limit the amount getting stuck to the pan.
Stir the grains once more at the end of the process to make sure that all of the water has been absorbed and that the grains are adequately tender.
 The freekeh should be ready to serve now. You can enjoy it as a side dish as is, or you can opt to use it in another dish that calls for pre-cooked freekeh.

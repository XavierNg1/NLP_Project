 Look for the Facebook app on your mobile device. It’s the one with the app icon with the Facebook logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 If you logged out of your previous Facebook session, you will be asked to log in. Enter your registered email address and password into the fields provided, and tap “Log in” to access your account.
 By default, you will be taken to your News Feed after logging in, but if ever you’re on a different page, head to your News Feed by tapping the icon of three horizontal bars from the header to bring out a menu.


Tap “News Feed” from the menu.
 Swipe through your News Feed and look for any post from the friend you don’t want to see status updates from.
 Tap on the down arrow on the upper right corner of the post box to select it.
 Tap “Unfollow” from the menu that will appear. You won’t see anymore posts from this particular friend.


Don’t worry, you didn’t unfriend him on Facebook. You’re still friends; his posts will just be hidden from your newsfeed.

 Find a base page that you love. It's preferred to use sheets that are 12 x 12, but it doesn't matter the texture, just make sure you love it. My choice was a baby print on a key-lime color.;
, This paper can be any color, just make sure it looks good over the base paper you picked out. This is by far the hardest part. Choosing coordinating papers can be time consuming and don't be afraid to ask for a second opinion. My choice was a plain white paper, no under-lying pattern.
 My theme was rubber duckies, so a cute stamp along with a stamp pad in blue was perfect. My goal was simple, yet elegant and it fit perfectly.
 I picked elegant brads that had colors that matched my base paper. I also considered using ribbon or ducky buttons, but found these brads were perfect.
 It is recommended that you use their footprint template and then make the footprint the same color to match the background(thus making it disappear), then fill in the information to your needs. It has a great printer setting where you can print one to four of the invitations on one page. This project uses their setting for 4 per a page.
 This will give you enough for 12 invitations. Let them dry for 5 minutes to avoid smearing.
, It's recommended that you use a rotary cutter instead of scissors. Tearing isn't recommended for vellum paper.
 12x12 paper sheets are perfect because it gives you exactly 6 invitations per sheet, so only two sheets are needed.

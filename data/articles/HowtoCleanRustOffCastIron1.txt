 The precise amount of salt you need varies depending on the size of your pan. Sprinkle salt to the point the surface of the cast iron is covered in a somewhat thick layer.For example, about half a cup of salt would be used for a 12 inch cast iron pan.;
, Cut a potato in half. The potato will be course enough to rub away rust as you rub the salt into the cast iron. Place it on the cast iron cut side down and scrub the salt in to remove rust.Use a great deal of pressure as this will help scrape off the rust.
Rub the potato in a circular motion.
If you're scrubbing something like a pot or pan, do not forget the sides and bottom.
 Once you've scraped away the rust, rinse your pan under the faucet. Get out any remaining traces of salt and potato. Immediately pat dry your pan with paper towel. Then, place your pan on the stove over low heat. This will help get rid of any lingering moisture.It's very important to dry your pan off immediately. Water causes rust with cast iron pans, and if you leave your pan wet it will just get rusty again.
 Unfortunately, removing rust removes the seasoning of a cast iron pan. After treating it with salt, apply a small amount of vegetable or olive to the pan using a paper towel. Then, take a clean paper towel and remove any excess oil. Place your pan over low heat for about 30 minutes. This should re-season the pan.Blot off any excess oil after removing your pan from the heat and storing it.

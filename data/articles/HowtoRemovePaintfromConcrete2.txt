 Assemble your materials. You will need paint stripper. If you are working in a well-ventilated area (outside or in an open, separate garage), you can use a stripper with methylene chloride. This will make the process much faster. You will need a respirator if working with this kind of paint stripper.









You will also need absorbent material. Finely ground clay is most effective. If you donâ€™t have access, you can crush up cat litter into a powder.
To finish the cleanup job, you will need a stiff brush and scouring powder.
 Create a paste with your clay or cat litter. Depending on how thick the stripper is, you may not need to add much material. The absorbent material will help draw the paint off of the concrete, making it easier to scrape off.
 Apply a layer of the absorbent paint stripper mixture to the paint spot on the concrete. Allow time for the stripper to work. Depending on the chemicals that you are using, this could take anywhere from 20 minutes to several hours.









Add more paint thinner to the applied mixture during the process to keep the ingredients active.
 The paint thinner should have done most of the work for you, allowing you to remove most of the paint by simply scraping the mixture off with a hard plastic scraper. Add a second layer of mixture if there is remaining paint, and repeat the process.
 Use the stiff brush, scouring powder, and water to scrub at the stripped surface, removing any excess paint particles. Rinse away the scouring mixture and keep scrubbing with the brush to finish the job.

 The formula states that d=(x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}}}, where d{\displaystyle d} equals the distance of the line, (x1,y1){\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})} equal the coordinates of the first endpoint of the line segment, and (x2,y2){\displaystyle (x_{2},y_{2})} equal the coordinates of the second endpoint of the line segment., These might already be given. If not, count along the x-axis and y-axis to find the coordinates.

The x-axis is the horizontal axis; the y-axis is the vertical axis.

The coordinates of a point are written as (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)}.

For example, a line segment might have an endpoint at (2,1){\displaystyle (2,1)} and another at (6,4){\displaystyle (6,4)}.
 Be careful to substitute the values for the correct variables. The two x{\displaystyle x} coordinates should be inside the first set of parentheses, and the two y{\displaystyle y} coordinates should be inside the second set of parentheses.

For example, for points (2,1){\displaystyle (2,1)} and (6,4){\displaystyle (6,4)}, your formula would look like this: d=(6−2)2+(4−1)2{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {(6-2)^{2}+(4-1)^{2}}}}


, By using the order of operations, any calculations in parentheses must be completed first.

For example:d=(6−2)2+(4−1)2{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {(6-2)^{2}+(4-1)^{2}}}}d=(4)2+(3)2{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {(4)^{2}+(3)^{2}}}}


, The order of operations states that exponents should be addressed next.

For example:d=(4)2+(3)2{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {(4)^{2}+(3)^{2}}}}d=16+9{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {16+9}}}


, You do this calculation as if you were working with whole numbers.

For example:d=16+9{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {16+9}}}d=25{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {25}}}


, To reach your final answer, find the square root of the sum under the radical sign.

Since you are finding a square root, you may have to round your answer.

Since you are working on a coordinate plane, your answer will be in generic “units,” not in centimeters, meters, or another metric unit.

For example:d=25{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {25}}}d=5{\displaystyle d=5} units

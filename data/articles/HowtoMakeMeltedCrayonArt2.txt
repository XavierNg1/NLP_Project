 Prop it up against a wall or a chair lined with a towel. Some area that you're not concerned about getting messy. Choose a size of canvas that you think you can cover with the amount of crayons you have.
 Unwrap the crayons of your choice, shave them down to size (in order to fit), and place one into the glue gun.









If you want to use multiple colors, once you've placed the first crayon into the glue gun, start pushing in the second, then third and so out - this will force crayon in front of it out .
 With this method, you have the ultimate power of color control; it'll go wherever you want. You could keep to the standard drip look or create shapes and designs. Put the gun tip close to the canvas and create away!









Once you have nothing to push in, add another crayon. You'll see the color coming out of the tip slowly lighten or darken as the next crayon gets ready to take the spotlight.
 That was a lot quicker than blow drying, huh? If you think your glue gun is salvageable, insert a regular glue stick and work through until what comes out is clear and glue-y and no longer colored and waxy.


If you aren't happy with a section of your painting, with this method it's very easy to go back and redo (or add to) an area.

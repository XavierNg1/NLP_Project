 Cornstarch is highly absorbent and should bind to the oil-based petroleum jelly.It may also be called corn flour or maize starch.


If you don't have corn starch on-hand, you can try baking powder or baby powder instead.No matter which agent you use (corn starch, baby powder, baking powder), be careful not to inhale any of the particles. It can irritate the delicate tissues in your lungs., Rubbing can damage your hair or be abrasive to your skin, but you do want the powder to reach all the vaseline in your hair. Patting it will help push the corn starch into your hair.Allow the corn starch to sit for a few minutes, giving it time to absorb the oil.


Make sure you cover all of the Vaseline-coated hair with the corn starch. You want to get as much of the Vaseline absorbed as possible--this may prevent you from having to repeat the process., Cold water may cause the Vaseline to congeal and thicken, making it even more difficult to remove.Clarifying shampoo is easy to find and is used to remove excess oil and product build-up from hair.Shampoo your hair twice with the clarifying shampoo. This may dry out your hair some, but it will help make sure you get out as much of the oil as possible., Towel-blot your hair dry and allow it to air dry., The corn starch and clarifying shampoo may have absorbed and stripped away much of your hair's natural oil. Giving your hair time to recover will decrease the likelihood of damage.

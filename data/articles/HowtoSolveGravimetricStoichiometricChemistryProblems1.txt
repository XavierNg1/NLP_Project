 You'll need to use this in a moment to write your reaction equation.


Calculate the mass of iron (III) oxide produced by the reaction of 500g of iron with oxygen from the air.;
, This can either be solid (s), gas (g), liquid (l), or aqueous (aq). Aqueous simply means dissolved in water, and is often written in problems as "solution". Aqueous does not mean liquid! If no state is given and it is an element, use the state on the periodic table. If it is a compound that is a reactant, you can write it as (aq).


Calculate the mass of iron (III) oxide produced by the reaction of 500g of iron with oxygen from the air.
 While dealing with Gravimetric stoichiometry, these will be either weights or moles of reactants or products.

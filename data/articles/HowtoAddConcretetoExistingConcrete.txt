 Aggregate is an additive - usually sand or stone - added to the cement mix to make it cheaper. For a very thin coat, you should choose a small aggregate. Larger aggregates cannot be used in thin coats.;
, To prepare the existing concrete, clean and roughen the current surface before you begin any other steps. You can use a chemical concrete product that will accomplish both of these goals at the same time.
 Soaking the existing concrete will make it unable to absorb liquid from the new concrete. Failing to follow this step can create a poor bond between the new and existing concrete.
 Make a water concrete mix that is thinner than the package directions. A viscosity similar to paint will work well. Use a stiff brush to apply it to the existing concrete. This step is not a requirement, but it will help create a tighter bond between new and existing concrete. Do not let this slurry coat dry before applying the new concrete.
 Mix the concrete according to package directions. If you are using regular concrete, add a concrete bonding additive to help the old and new concrete join. If you are using a concrete patching product, do not add the bonding additive because it is part of the patching mix.
 Pour your concrete mixture to a level slightly below what you want the final level to be. Do not use a trowel at this point. A rough surface on the first pour will help the final pour to stick better.
 You may begin the next step when the first pour is mostly hardened.
 Add a concrete bonding additive, if necessary.
 Use a trowel to evenly spread the concrete in the second pour into the concrete from the first pour. This is the point at which you need to be careful to make the surface smooth and level.
 Cover the newly poured concrete with a plastic sheet or spray it with curing compound to ensure the concrete takes a long time to cure. The longer the curing process, the stronger the finished concrete repair will be.

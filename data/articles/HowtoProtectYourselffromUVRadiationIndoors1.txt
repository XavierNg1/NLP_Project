 Ordinary glass blocks "short wave" UVB light, but only blocks 50% or less of the more common "long wave" UVA light.Add a UV-protective film to any windows that are not specially built to block UV light. This is especially important for windows near areas where you spend a lot of time, at home, at work, or in the car. The film blocks up to 99.9% of all UV radiation. You can install it yourself or hire professionals to do so.You can purchase UV-protective film at home improvement stores or online.
Note that vehicle windshields are UV resistant, but that side and rear windows are often not. Especially if you spend a lot of time in your vehicle during the day, add a UV protective film to these windows as well.;
, People who spend extensive periods of time near an open or unprotected window will experience more rapid aging of the skin on that side of their face. If you like to keep your window open, consider sitting a bit further away, and changing your location relative to the window from time to time., If you know you are exposed to sunlight despite being indoors, it may be worth wearing sunscreen. If you do, make sure youâ€™re wearing broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher.Broad spectrum sunscreen, which is necessary to block both major types of harmful UV radiation, includes some combination of the following ingredients: avobenzone (Parsol 1789), ecamsule, oxybenzone, titanium dioxide, and zinc oxide.
Alternatively, you can use a moisturizer for UV protection indoors, as long as it has broad spectrum protection and an SPF of at least 15.
 A QTemp is a small, battery-powered device that reports the amount of UV radiation in your location. It can be used to alert you when an area is especially high in UV radiation, and prompt you to take the necessary steps to protect yourself with broad spectrum sunscreen in those areas.The QTemp device works both indoors and outdoors.

 Only use jars that are approved for canning. Jars that are not specifically designed to work with canning should be avoided since the glass may not be able to withstand the heat. You can use pint (500 ml), quart (1000 ml), or half-gallon (2 liter) jars, but pint (500 ml) jars tend to preserve the juice best. After all, you will be able to go through the juice in a small jar faster than you would a large jar.
 Leave 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of empty space in between the top of the juice and the rim of the jar. Wipe off any spilled juice.
 Canning jars have a special lid made of a flat lid piece and a ring. Seat the flat lid piece over the mouth of the jar and secure the ring around the lid piece and the mouth of the jar. Screw it on as tightly as possible.
 In the absence of a canner, you may also use a large, heavy stockpot. Either way, the jars should be covered by about 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5 cm) of water.
 Cover the canner or stockpot and boil the water until the pressure can process and seal the jars. The amount of time you should boil the water depends on the size jar you use and the altitude you live at.


For pint and quart (500 and 1000 ml) jars, boil the water for 5 minutes.
For half-gallon (2 liter) jars, boil the water for 10 minutes.
Add an extra 5 minutes onto these times if you live at an altitude between 1000 and 6000 ft (305 m to 1.8 km) or an extra 10 minutes if you live at an altitude above 6000 ft (1.8 km).
 After the jars have rested in the boiling water for an appropriate amount of time, turn off the heat, remove the lid of the pot, and carefully lift the jars out of the hot water using canning tongs. Allow them to cool at room temperature in an area free from drafts. The cooling process should take several hours to overnight.
 Gently press down on the center of the lid. If it "pops," the jar is not properly sealed. If this happens, you should boil the contents of the jar and redo the canning process to create a better seal.

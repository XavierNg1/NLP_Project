 Generally speaking, having a successful relationship requires confidence in yourself and believing that you deserve to be loved. If you love yourself, you are more prepared to be in a relationship. If you shared your feelings and they were well received, after a bit of time has passed (the amount of time varies for each couple) you may begin to feel like you want to have an official relationship.


You cannot just assume that both of you are on the same page. You have to ask him whether or not he wants to be your official boyfriend.
 Sometimes when you take a step back and really think about the person and your interactions, you can tell whether or not there is a future for the relationship. In some instances, it is best not to move forward with the relationship, but instead just decide to be friends.
 If you decide to move forward with the relationship, you should be clear about your expectations and what you need from a boyfriend in order for the relationship to be successful.
 You can have a long-term, committed, and loving relationship if that is what you truly desire. As with all relationships, it will take time, mutual respect, and ongoing effort. If you both agree to be boyfriends, start having fun together and enjoying each otherâ€™s company.


It is important to clarify what type of relationship you want to have. Simply saying that you are boyfriends may not be enough. You should talk about whether or not your relationship is monogamous and whether or not you both see a future together.If you have not already, now is a good time to make sure that he is not in another relationship, especially if you decide to be exclusive.

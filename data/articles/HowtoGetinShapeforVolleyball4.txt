 Wrap your fingers behind your head with your elbows sticking out to either side. Sink into a squat until your legs form a roughly 90- degree angle. Keep your upper body as vertical as possible and your chin up so that you are looking forward, not down. From here:Use the balls of your feet to push yourself up and forward into a jump.Donâ€™t worry about jumping high. Simply aim to land a few feet in front of your starting position.
As you land on the balls of your feet, absorb the shock with your legs by sinking back into another squat.
Jump again and repeat for a total of five to ten reps per set.
 Stand within jumping distance with both feet planted hip-width apart, facing the box. From this starting position:Jump off the ground with both feet, using the balls of your feet to push yourself off the ground.Land on the box with both feet, distributing your weight evenly across them to stay balanced.
Starting small so you have as much control over your last jump as your first, work your way up until you can complete three sets of 20 jumps per workout.
As you master the height of one box or surface, challenge yourself by working with another that is even higher.
 Use two dumbbells weighing between 10 and 25 lbs (4.5 to 11.3 kg). Hold one in each hand, down along your sides. Set your feet directly below your shoulders and straighten your back. From here:Jump directly upward, not forward.
Shrug your shoulders upward as you ascend.
Relax your shoulders as you descend.
Land in your starting position with both feet at the same time.
Increase your sets and/or reps until you can do three sets of 25.

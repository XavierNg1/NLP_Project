 On a multiplayer server, the server administrators decide whether cheats are enabled. On a single-player world, the player chooses whether cheats are allowed when the world is created. However, you can enable cheats just for this game session by going to the menu and clicking Open to LAN, selecting the "Enable Cheats" option, and clicking Start LAN World., Press T on your keyboard to open the chat window. Type /tp (your username) (another player's name), without the parentheses, to teleport next to that player. This will instantly transport you with all your items. If you are in a single-player game, or do not know any players near your house or a recognizable landmark, you can only teleport to other coordinates instead, using /tp (your username) (x) (y) (z).


See the section on using coordinates for more information.
 In creative mode, your character cannot die (unless you fall into the Void or use the /kill command) and will be able to fly through the air, making it much easier to search for your house. Open the chat window and type /gamemode creative (your username), without the parentheses. Once you've found your house, fly down to the ground and type /gamemode survival (your username) or /gamemode adventure (your username) to return to your previous mode.


If you are still lost, go to the menu and select the highest render distance. This may cause your game to lag, but will let you see a great distance away.

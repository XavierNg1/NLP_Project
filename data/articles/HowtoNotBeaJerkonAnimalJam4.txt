If someone is new and wants to trade their rare, do not cheat them! A new jammer most probably won't realize they've been "fooled" and when they do, there won't be much they can do. Be fair and make a good trade, even though the jammer won't know if you under or overtrade them.
If someone would like very badly to be your friend, don't treat them as your slave! They don't have to give you anything (unless they somehow owe you), break rules for you or to talk to other people for you in order to be your friend. They shouldn't want to be friends with someone that tells them to do stuff they don't want to! If you're the person who wants to be friends with someone very badly, don't let them treat you that way! This is also relevant in real life.

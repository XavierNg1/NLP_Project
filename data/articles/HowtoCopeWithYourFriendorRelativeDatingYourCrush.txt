 Don't ask their friends but go to the source. Ask the crush or the relative. Sending an email asking them is always good. If they aren't then no sweat!;
, If your crush has already asked them to be their girlfriend or boyfriend, or they have gone out more than one time, then time to take action. If it's only a one off thing then wait a few weeks and see what happens before you do anything drastic.
 Even if you are upset, don't get depressed. Keep in mind that even if you had gone out with your crush, it probably would have been over in a few weeks. There are always more fish in the sea; you can find other people you like.
 It'll be stressful watching the pair of them together, and you have to be a strong person to do that.
 It'll bring you a lot less pain, but do not completely blank them both out. Otherwise they'll wonder what they did to you.
 However,don't tell a girl who will obviously go and tell your crush and mate.
 You can make a deal with her that she still spends equal amount of time with you as she does with her boyfriend.
 Meeting new lads will help you get over your crush, but if you seriously think it won't help, then don't try to get involved with another boy just yet.
 Hang out with him and his pals with your crew, but don't start flirting with him. You don't want to risk losing your friendship with your mate if she catches you. Friends are more important than a crush.


Start looking at people at school and hang out with them. Don't worry, everyone finds someone.

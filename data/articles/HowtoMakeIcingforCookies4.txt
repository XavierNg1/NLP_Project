 This delicious chocolate buttercream frosting will take you less than fifteen minutes to make. It works very well on chocolate cookies. You can use it with other pastries of your choice, as well. If you want regular buttercream frosting, simply omit the cocoa.
 Allow the butter to soften at room temperature for about fifteen minutes before you begin. Once it’s softened, place all of the ingredients into a large bowl. Use a mixer to combine them until the mixture looks creamy and fluffy.
 The frosting should be airy, fluffy and easy to spread. If it’s not, add a little more milk and beat it again. Continue until it reaches the desired thickness. Make sure the end result is smooth, with no lumps of butter remaining in the mixture.
 Bake the cookies of your choice ahead of time. Let them cool completely before frosting them. This fluffy cream will spread very easily, so use a spoon or spatula to apply the desired amount to cookies and other pastries.


If you have any leftovers, put them in an airtight container.
The frosting will last up to two weeks in the refrigerator. It will last up to three months in the freezer.

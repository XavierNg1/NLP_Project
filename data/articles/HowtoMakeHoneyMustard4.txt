 This is great for pouring over meat or fish.
 This is an excellent choice for parties and dinner parties. Serve with crudités and crackers.
 Make a basic honey mustard and brush over the fish as a glaze. Grill as required by the fish or meat type.
 Honey mustard will give an added taste dimension to omelets, scrambled eggs, soufflés and other egg dishes.
 Spaghetti with honey mustard added to a favorite pasta cream sauce recipe is delicious.

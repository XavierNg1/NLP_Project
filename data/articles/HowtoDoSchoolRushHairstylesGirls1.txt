 A messy bun is the classic solution to hair woes for girls with medium to long hair. Begin making a messy bun by raking through your hair with your fingers to eliminate knots, then bring back your hair into a high ponytail and hold it in your hand.

, Hold your hair in the ponytail with your dominant hand. With your non-dominant hand, take the end of the ponytail and use your fingers to twist it around until the whole length of your hair is tightly twisted.
 Once you tightly twist your hair, release the base of the ponytail with your dominant hand and loop your hair around and around the base of your hair in a doughnut shape.
 Once you have twisted the hair completely around the base of ponytail, secure the hair in place with a hair elastic. You should now have a tight, almost ballerina-style bun.
 Once you have secured the bun, you should have a small, compact bun. To make the bun more voluminous and give it a chic, messy look, pull on the sides a little to open it up and make it bigger.
 Once you have adjusted the bun to approximately the size you want, use a few bobby pins to pin the bun in place and ensure that it doesnâ€™t fall out.
 To give the bun an extra-messy look, select a few small strands of hair and let them fall from the bun. Then spritz your style with hairspray and enjoy this casual chic style!

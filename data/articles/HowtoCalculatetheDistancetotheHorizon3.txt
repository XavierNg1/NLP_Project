 This method is a simpler version of the first set of instructions presented in this article, and applies only in feet and miles.
 The formula you will be using is d = 1.2246* SQRT(h)

, (R + h)2 = R2 + d2. Solving for h (making the assumption that R>>h and expressing the radius of the earth in miles, approx. 3959) yields the expression:
d = SQRT(2*R*h)

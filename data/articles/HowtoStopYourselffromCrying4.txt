 While people around you may see through your white lie, telling it may still help to calm you down.


Say you have been having really bad allergies. This is a classic excuse for having tears in your eyes--allergies make your eyes watery and red.
Yawn and then say something like, “yawning always makes my eyes water.”
Say you think you are getting sick. Often, when people get sick their eyes become glassy. Saying you feel sick also gives you a good excuse to leave the setting you are in.
 If you can’t help but shed a few tears, wiping them away discreetly is the next best thing to keeping yourself from crying.


Pretend that you're trying to get something out of the corner of your eye, then wipe along the bottom and wipe the tears off the edge. Pressing your index finger lightly into the inside corner of your eye will also help to dab away the tears.
Pretend you’re sneezing and put your face into the inside of your elbow (so that you can wipe your tears on your arm). If you can’t fake sneeze, just say "false alarm."

, If you are caught up in a negative situation that is making you want to cry, get out of it. This does not necessarily mean storming out of the room. If something is upsetting you, make an excuse to leave the room for a few moments. Taking a step back from whatever is causing you to want to cry will help you to feel better and control your tears.By taking a step back, you are distancing yourself both physically and mentally from the problem.


As you take a step back, breathe in deeply and then exhale just as deeply. You will find that you will feel less inclined to cry.

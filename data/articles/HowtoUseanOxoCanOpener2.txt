 The OXO Snap-Lock Can Opener has broad, easy-to-hold handles and a stainless steel cutting wheel.The handles are stacked on top of one another instead of side by side. You will notice a gray button along the top handle, which keeps the handles locked together. Press the gray button to open the handles., Once the handles are open, align the stainless steel cutting wheel with the top of the can. The lip of the can’s lid should be positioned between the cutting wheel on top and the support wheel on the bottom., After the lid has been securely positioned between the stainless steel wheels, lock the can opener into place by squeezing the handles. You will hear a loud snap. This indicates that the handles have shut and the can opener has locked onto the can., Hold the handles with one hand and grip the knob with the other. Gently rotate the knob clockwise. As the knob turns, the can will rotate.Be sure to complete a full rotation to completely remove the lid.
 Once you have completed a rotation, remove the can opener by pressing the gray button on the top of the handles with your thumb. The handles will open and release the can’s lid., The lid will fall into the can once the can opener has been unlocked. Place the can opener to the side. Carefully wedge your finger or butter knife beneath the lid and lift up. Once the lid has been lifted up, pinch the edge of the lid with your fingertips and remove it from the can. Be careful not to cut yourself on the sharp edges of the lid or can.
 Clean the can opener after each use to remove any food residue and to keep the can opener working properly. Use a damp paper towel or washcloth to wipe the cutting wheels, handles, or any other section that may have come into contact with food.

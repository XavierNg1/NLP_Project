 Since tonsil stones often form after leftover food gets stuck in tonsil craters, it's prudent to gargle with mouthwash after eating. Not only will mouthwash improve the health of your teeth and gums, it will also help dislodge tiny bits of food before they become a meal for tonsil stone-creating bacteria.


Make sure to use an alcohol-free mouthwash.
 Mix one teaspoon of salt along with six ounces of water, stirring until incorporated. Gargle the salt water with your head tilted back. Salt water could dislodge bits of food from the crater while helping to soothe any discomfort caused by tonsillitis, which sometimes accompanies tonsil stones., Oxygenating mouthwashes contain chlorine dioxide and natural zinc compounds. Oxygen itself hinders bacterial growth, making oxygenating mouthwashes helpful for treating and preventing tonsil stones.Oxygenating mouthwashes are very strong, however, and therefore should only be used once or twice per week to avoid overuse. Supplement your natural mouthwash regimen with oxygenating mouthwash.

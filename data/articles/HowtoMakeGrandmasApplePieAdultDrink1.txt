 Pour the apple cider, apple juice, white sugar, and brown sugar into a large pot. Add the clove and cinnamon, then bring the mixture to a boil.;
, Once the mixture has begun to boil, reduce the heat to medium low and let simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.
 Once combined, take the mixture off heat and allow to cool completely. Don't skimp on this stepâ€”adding the alcohol while the mixture is too hot will greatly decrease the potency of the drink!

, Pour in the Everclear and vanilla vodka and stir until mixed in.


If you don't have access to 190 proof Everclear, you can use 5 cups of 150 proof instead for the same effect.
 If you're going to be drinking the mixture right away, pour into glasses and serve. Alternatively, you can bottle the drink and refrigerate for consumption at a later time.

 You can use the clip from a pen or another small, flat, thin piece of metal to do the job. It must be about as thin as a credit card, and narrow enough to fit into the locking mechanism on the cuffs. This bit of metal is called a shim.
 Slide it up into the locking mechanism so that it runs along the teeth; you're essentially sticking it into the cuff along the rim.
 With the shim in place, tighten the cuff just one notch.
 As you're tightening the cuff, push the shim. The cuff should unclick.

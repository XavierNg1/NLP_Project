 You'll want your four ingredients to be in a roughly 2:2:3:2 ratio so that they form a paste of medium consistency - smooth, but not so liquid that it will run off of your head. Add more yogurt and honey to thicken as needed.
 Spend time spreading the mixture evenly from your roots to the end of your hair. Do this for about 10 minutes. This opens up the pores on your head and promotes blood circulation. Plus, it just plain feels great.
 Try sitting under a steamer as you allow your rub to set. Or, if you don't have have a steamer, let the rub set while you take a hot bath. If you don't have a bathtub, no worries - just allow the rub to set for a little longer (30-45 minutes).
 Hop in the shower and wash your hair. Usually, you'll need to shampoo and rinse twice to get all of the rub out of your hair. Don't overdo it - this can strip the scalp of the moisture provided by the rub. Use your daily conditioner for the ends of your hair only.
 Dry heat, such as that from a hair dryer, can contribute to a flaky, dandruff-y scalp. If you typically style your hair using a blow dryer, blow dry your hair delicately, making sure not to apply too much heat directly to your scalp. Optionally, use a hair straightener to style as you normally would.
 Take four to five drops of coconut oil in the palm of your hand and rub both hands together - this will warm the oil. Run both palms through your hair, transferring the oil onto your hair and scalp. Repeat as needed to cover all of your scalp.

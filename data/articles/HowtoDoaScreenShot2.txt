 If using Windows 7 or Windows Vista, navigate to this tool by selecting Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Snipping Tool.


Note that this feature is only available in Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows 8.
To open this tool using Windows 8, hit the Window graphic key on your keyboard to return to your Start screen. Begin typing "Snipping Tool" to automatically start a search for the application. Once the result pops up, click on it to open the tool.
 You could click the New button to automatically open a new rectangular selection snip, but clicking on the arrow provides you with more snipping types.
 The available options are Free-form Snip, Rectangular Snip, Window Snip, and Full-screen Snip.


Free-form Snip will allow you to draw a free-form shape around the area you want to take a screenshot of.
Rectangular Snip is the default option and will allow you to draw a rectangle around the area you want to take a screenshot of.
Window Snip will take a screenshot of your active window.
Full-screen Snip will take a screenshot of your entire screen.
 If you selected Free-form Snip or Rectangular Snip, you will need to draw a selection box or other shape around the portion of your screen you wish to capture.


A new window containing that image will automatically pop up once your selection is complete.
 This will open the Save As dialog box, where you can save the screenshot.
 Type in a name for your file and change the file type as desired.


The available file types are png, gif, jpeg, and single file html.
Make sure to save the image to your Pictures folder or another location you will be able to navigate to later.
 This will save the screenshot and complete the process.

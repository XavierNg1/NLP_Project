 You are only responsible for your feelings, not the boy’s. If you aren’t interested in doing something, even when you like the boy, don’t do it. He may try to pressure you or tell you why you’re being unfair, but your wants are what’s important.A boy who really cares about you won’t pressure you to do something you don’t want to, so don’t be afraid to lose a guy you like. If he can’t take “no” for an answer, then he isn’t good for you.
 If you want to turn a guy down, let him know that you just aren’t interested. You don’t need an excuse or reason. Be direct and firm, then change the subject. If he brings it up again, say, “I told you I’m not interested, so don’t keep asking.”Tell him, “That isn’t something that I’m interested in right now,” or “I just want to be friends. I hope you understand.”
Don’t use another guy as an excuse. As tempting as it is to say, “I have a boyfriend,” that will make him think that he might have a chance if you were single. Plus, it takes away your power to say no just because it’s what you want.
Don’t worry about hurting his feelings or being “nice.”

, Tell your friends about the boy’s crush on you and that you aren’t interested. Your friends can help you avoid awkward encounters and unwanted advances., If you start to feel uncomfortable with a boy, it’s okay to tell him to stop, even if it’s not the first time you’ve done something with him. For example, if you’ve been kissing a friend you kind of like, that doesn’t mean you have to keep doing it.If you do something with a boy that you regret, you can still say “no” the next time.
 If a guy is pestering you, walk away and try to find someone you can rely on as a buffer, like a friend or authority figure., Sometimes the boy you want to back off is a friend. If he doesn’t respect your decision and keeps trying to initiate a relationship, then you may have to cut ties with him. While you don’t want to lose him, he’s not being a good friend to you. Additionally, he may believe that your continued friendship is a sign that you might actually like him.Distance yourself from him by saying “no” to spending one-on-one time with him. If you must cross paths with him, talk to your other friends about acting as a buffer.
If he asks you to hang out, say, “I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to spend time together anymore.”

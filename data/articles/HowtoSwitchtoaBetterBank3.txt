 For a at least a month after you stop using an old account, keep enough money in the account to cover any payments you may have forgotten about. If there is a minimum balance fee associated with your old account, keep the balance above the minimum.Before actually closing your an account, make sure direct deposits have been re-directed, automatic bill payments are being successfully deducted from your new account, any checks written against the old account have cleared, and you have new your new debit card and/or checks.
 Many financial institutions require a written letter to close an account. Provide the numbers for the accounts you wish to close, as well as an address where you would like the check with the remaining balance sent.Include the date, your phone number, your written name, and your mailing address as well.
A short, simple letter will suffice. For example, “Hello. Please close the accounts with numbers XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX. Further, please mail a check with the remaining balance to .”
Keep a copy of all of your financial records, but especially the correspondence about closing your account.
 If you forget about a source of income and an automatic payment is made to an old account, some banks will automatically reopen an account. Believe it or not, you may then be required to pay monthly maintenance fees and minimum balance fees on that account.Periodically check for zombie accounts by keeping the phone app for your old account’s online banking platform. Log in about a month after you close the account, and then again a few months after that.
Contact your old financial institution directly if a zombie account has been opened. You’ll likely be able to close the account without penalty. If your old bank pressures you to pay fees incurred because a zombie account was reopened, consider filing a report with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

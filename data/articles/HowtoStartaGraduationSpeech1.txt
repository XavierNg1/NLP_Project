 Bring note cards if you haven’t written out your whole speech. Make sure that they are easily accessible. You don’t want to be fumbling around up on the podium in front of everyone. Make sure you’re ready to start as soon as you get up there.;
, You want to speak about something that matters to you, obviously, but a big part about giving a speech is connecting to those who are listening. Try to find the balance between what matters to you and what matters to everyone else. Hopefully, if you’re the graduation speaker, there will be a big overlap.
 It’s natural to be nervous. However, part of being prepared is figuring out a way to calm your nerves. Try practicing in front of your friends or parents so that you feel comfortable with the rhythm of the words. This way you’ll be less likely to stumble.

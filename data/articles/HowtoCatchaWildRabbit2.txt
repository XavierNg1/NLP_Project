 Depending on the size of rabbit you're catching, your hole should probably be several feet deep and several feet wide. The deeper your hole, the lower the chance that any fallen rabbit could climb back out.


Place the hole either in the middle of a rabbit trail or someplace where you image rabbits to be. If you don't place the trap in the middle of a trail, you'll need to lure a rabbit over onto the pit trap using bait.
 Getting the right width is important. Too large and your pitfall trap won't trigger when a rabbit steps over it. Too small and you'll never be able to make your trap stand up. Gather three or four of these kind of sticks. Lay them across the width of the trap.
 Try to get a crosshatch pattern going â€” three or four big sticks going in one direction and lots of small twigs going in the other direction.
, If the surroundings are varied, make sure to vary the top of the dirt. Try also to harvest old dirt and place it on top, so that the dirt doesn't look freshly-dug.
 Place corn, carrots, or other vegetables on top of the trap to lure the rabbit onto the trap. Try placing the bait in the middle of the trap so that the rabbit has to step onto the center of the pit trap in order to activate it.
 Mark the trap so that you can locate it again quickly and efficiently. Remember to check the trap every day so that if you do catch a rabbit, you won't cause it to unnecessarily suffer while it's in captivity.

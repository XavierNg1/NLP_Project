 Big anniversaries are a great time to reflect on how your organization got started and how it has since developed. Think of it as an exercise in strategic thinking.Think about the big questions about your company's past: Who founded it, and why? What was the original vision of the company? Reaffirm the values that are the hallmark of what you stand for as a company, but be willing to reassess those that have not served you well.
 A major corporate anniversary is a great time to issue new vision plans or mission statements for the coming years.


Try filling in the blanks to complete this statement: "Our company was founded with a vision for _____. Our goals were ____, _____, and _____." Then think about whether your company met those goals, and whether it might be time to set new ones.
 Particularly if this is your company's centennial or other huge milestone, consider choosing an appropriate theme that builds on your company's past and current values to mark the anniversary year.For example, the year might be spent in "Innovation," "Service," "Diversity," or other value that will help to strategically situate your company for success in the coming years.
Consider launching a company-wide initiative to give form to the year's theme. For example, your departments might set benchmarks or goals to measure innovation or service projects.

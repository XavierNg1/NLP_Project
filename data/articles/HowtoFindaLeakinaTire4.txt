 Some leaks can be repaired, but leaks on the shoulder or sidewall of the tire should never be repaired. If you have a puncture in the tread area that is less than 1/4" in diameter then a repair may be your best option. If you are unsure of whether to replace or repair the tire consult a professional., Some people prefer to fix leaks on their own. To do this you can patch your tire, or for smaller leaks you can use a tire sealant such as Fix-A-Flat for a temporary fix.
 If you aren't able to fix the leak yourself you should take it to a professional tire shop. If it is a slow leak it may be safe for you to pump the tire up and drive to the shop. Otherwise, it may be necessary to have your car towed to the tire shop.

 Import the video file into the program, then drag the clip into the timeline. If you only want to speed up a specific section of the video, make sure to Split the video at the the beginning and end of the "sub-clip" to create a separately-adjustable clip.;
, Find this tab at the far-right end of the navigation bar along the top of the window: to the right of Home, Animations, Visual Effects, Project, and View.
 Find this in the central "Adjust" section of the Video Tools Edit bar: above Duration; to the right of Background Color; and to the left of Split.
 The values range down the drop-down menu relative to the original speed of the video: 1x. If you select 0.125x, you will slow the clip down to 1/8 of its the current speed. If you choose 64x, you will increasing the speed by sixty-four times the current pace. If you aren't sure which speed to use, consider why you need to speed up the video.Choose the highest values (64x, 32x, 16x) if you are speeding up a video of something incredibly slow: a sunset, or a snowman melting, or a plant growing.
Use 8x or 4x if you want to fit something fairly slow into a much shorter span of video time: a snail crossing a driveway, or a group of people building something.
Speed the video up 2x—double the original speed—if you want to speed along a regular scene without losing clarity, or if you want to minutely adjust a clip of something slow.
If you decide that you want to slow down the video, use a small value: 0.125x, 0.25x, or 0.5x.
 Watch the video through, and make sure that the new, faster speed works with your vision for the project. If not: adjust it. Don't be afraid to split the clip in question into a collection of even-smaller clips, each with its own unique speed. Be aware that when you speed up the video, you shorten its duration – so it will look shorter on the timeline.

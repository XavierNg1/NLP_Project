 Research colleges and universities with strong architecture programs. Majoring in architecture will ensure you have the prerequisites you need to enter an architecture master's program.


Some schools offer five-year programs that allow you to combine your bachelor's and master's degree without the need to apply to separate programs. Make sure the program you choose is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).
Art, math, environmental design, and other relevant majors are also appropriate choices to prepare you for a career in architecture. Just make sure you've taken the courses required to apply to graduate programs.
 If you did not enter a five-year combined bachelor's and master's program, you will need a master's in architecture after completing your undergraduate degree. Some programs focus on innovative, modern design, some on restoration, and others on environmentally-friendly design. Research programs that meet your needs and personality.
 Each state requires that potential architects complete an IDP before they are granted licensure. The programs are designed to give hands-on exposure in the areas of pre-design, design, project management and practice management.


Most IDP programs take about three years to complete.
It is possible to begin an IDP while you are still enrolled in school. Hours spent working in an architecture firm or completing school projects may count toward the IDP.
 The ARE has sections relating to may facets of the architect profession, and assesses whether the architecture candidate has the knowledge and skills needed to perform an architect's role.


The test has more components than can be completed in one day. Candidates are required to schedule a day to take each section of the test until they are all completed.
Consider taking a seminar or study course to prepare for the ARE.

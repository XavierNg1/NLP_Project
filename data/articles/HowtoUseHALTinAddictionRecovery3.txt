 Think about which feelings, places, or people make you want to relapse. Take these triggers seriously. If something was a trigger for you in the past, it will probably remain a trigger in the future.Besides HALT, a few common triggers for relapse include seeing people you used to drink or do drugs with, feeling overly confident about your recovery, and feeling scared about how sobriety will change your life.
 Don’t try to test or tempt yourself. If you know that a certain place or situation is likely to trigger you, stay away from it.Set boundaries that will help you avoid your triggers, such as not going to bars anymore.
 When you feel stressed or have a craving, pause and evaluate the feeling. Ask yourself what you’re struggling with or trying to avoid.For instance, you might discover that your urge to relapse is rooted in your feelings about a recent argument with your partner.
If you practice mindfulness regularly, you’ll find it easier to explore your feelings without acting on them.
 Know ahead of time what you’ll do when a craving hits. Think about the situations you’re likely to find yourself in, and come up with some healthy and appropriate alternatives to using drugs or alcohol.For instance, you might decide to keep some nonperishable snacks in your car, call your sponsor if you’re feeling lonely, and practice deep breathing exercises to calm down if you’re angry at someone.
Make your healthy coping strategy as easy as possible to carry out.
 Urge surfing is the practice of waiting a craving out instead of giving in to it. Instead of trying to ignore or get rid of the craving, focus on how it makes you feel. Pay attention to the sensations it creates in your body. Eventually, the craving will fade by itself.Urge surfing is essentially a form of mindfulness.

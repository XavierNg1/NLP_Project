 Turn on the oven to 350 degrees F (180 C). Take one 8-ounce (226 g) block of mozzarella cheese and use a sharp knife to cut it into 1/2-inch (12 mm) cubes. You should get about 20 small cubes of cheese.You could also use pepper jack, cheddar, or monterey jack cheese.;
, Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and set it aside. Get out a large mixing bowl and place all of the meatball ingredients in it. Use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture well. You'll need:1 pound (454 g) of ground beef
3/4 cup (70 g) of plain bread crumbs
1/2 cup (50 g) of grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup (120 ml) of water
2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons of garlic powder
1 teaspoon of salt
3/4 teaspoon of black pepper

, Gather a few tablespoons of meatball mixture into a ball and press one cheese cube in the center of it. Spread the meatball mixture around the cheese, so it is encased in meat. Continue to form the stuffed meatballs until you use up the meat mixture. You should have about 20 stuffed meatballs. Place them on the prepared baking sheet.You can use spoons or a small cookie scoop to portion out the meatballs.
 Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the stuffed meatballs for 15 to 20 minutes. The meat shouldn't be pink and should be at least 160 degrees F (70 C). Serve the stuffed meatballs right away.Don't worry if some of the cheese cooks out of the meatballs, just try to remove them from the pan immediately, so they don't stick.

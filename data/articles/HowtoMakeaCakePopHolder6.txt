 Wrap around the carton using pretty gift paper. Pierce holes with the metal skewer in through the paper, as described in the egg carton method above. This can be used as it is or slipped into a neat box or on a serving tray with the completed cake pops inserted. Add a ribbon for a final touch.
 Cut the foam to size to fit inside the container. Cover up the foam with paper grass, cellophane strips, ribbons, or anything else that looks great. Alternatively, simply cover with pretty paper or tissue/crepe paper balls. Insert the cake pops into the container in a fan or flower shape.
 Make sure that they're packed tight, then insert the cake pops at the top. Add a ribbon around the jar.
 Insert the cake pops directly into the sugar, which will hold the sticks in place.
, Double the amount of cake, if you align this carefully, you can slice the cake and each diner gets a slice of cake with a cake pop decoration!

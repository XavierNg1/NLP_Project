 Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 C). Place 1/2 cup (55 g) of hazelnuts onto a rimmed baking sheet. Bake the hazelnuts for 20 minutes. The skins will crack and the hazelnuts will smell toasted. Remove the hazelnuts and set them on a clean towel. Rub the towel over the hazelnuts to remove the skins. Chop the hazelnuts and set them aside.You can discard the hazelnut skins.
Chop the hazelnuts as coarse or as fine as you like. Keep in mind that larger pieces will give a bigger crunch to the fudge.
 Lay a large sheet of foil into an 8-inch (20 cm) square pan. Rub butter over the foil and set the pan aside while you melt the fudge. Place all of the ingredients in a small saucepan and turn the heat on to medium. Stir the mixture until it melts. You'll need:1 (14 ounces or 396 g) can of sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon vanilla (or 1 tablespoon of coffee-flavored liqueur)
8 ounces (175 g) of bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
1 cup (296 g) of chocolate hazelnut spread (like Nutella)
3 tablespoons of unsalted butter, softened
1/2 teaspoon of coarse sea salt flakes, plus more for sprinkling

, Once the fudge mixture has completely melted, turn off the heat and remove the pan. Stir in the chopped, toasted hazelnuts and 1/2 cup (80 g) of chopped dried cherries. Transfer the fudge to your prepared pan and spread it evenly.For a tangier taste, consider using dried cranberries instead of the dried cherries.
 Sprinkle a little extra sea salt over the top of the fudge, if you like and cover the fudge with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the fudge for 3 to 4 hours. The fudge should be firm. Lift the fudge up and out of the pan using the foil. Cut the fudge into 64 1-inch (20 cm) pieces.Refrigerate the fudge in an airtight container until you're ready to serve it.

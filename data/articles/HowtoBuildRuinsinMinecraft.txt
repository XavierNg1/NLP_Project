 Go look for a tree or create a tree by placing a sapling on the grass and then clicking on the sapling while holding a bone meal.;
, While holding a bucket filled with lava, go to the top and then pour it on.


If you are not in creative mode, be careful to not let the lava touch you.
Wait for the lava to flow all over the tree.
 In Minecraft, cobblestone is made when lava and water are mixed. That’s why to make our quick-and-easy ruins we need to pour water on the lava-covered tree.


Once you have poured water, just let it flow all over the tree. You will start to see a natural ruin form.
Get rid of the excess lava by putting cobblestone or any other type of stones above them.
 You can get rid of the water by putting a stone on the same place where you’ve poured the water, which was on top of the tree. Let the water drain out from your ruins.
 Destroy the remaining parts of the tree like its trunk and its leaves by clicking on it while having an axe equipped.
 Add in and replace some of the cobblestone with mossy cobblestone, mossy bricks, and cracked bricks to make the building look older. Randomly place the blocks.
 To make your ruins look even older, add in some shrubs, vines, and cobwebs.
 This will make the structure look older and destroyed.

Email authentication. Apple will send an email that gives you a link to reset your password. Do not choose this option if you can no longer access the email account associated with your Apple ID.

Answer security questions. If the email on file for that Apple ID is no longer valid, Apple provides a second method: answering the security questions you entered when you originally set up your Apple ID.

Enter the Recovery Key Apple gave you when you enabled two-step verification, and respond to the verification message sent to one of your "trusted devices" (typically a phone).


If you have lost your recovery key or access to your trusted devices, you will not be able to regain your password.Make a new Apple ID, or contact Apple's support number for ID security or general-purpose Apple Support.
 Enter a secure password, re-enter to confirm it, then click "Reset Password."

If you couldn't remember the answers to your security questions, use this management screen to change the questions to something more memorable.

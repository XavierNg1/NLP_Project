 Some staircases are plagued by too much awkward negative space. Turn a negative into a positive by filling these spaces with freestanding cabinets, trunks or cubbies that can house clutter. Every corner presents a possibility.Tall, vertical cabinets can be just the right size to position around cramped stairways.Go shopping for attractive storage containers that suit your home’s design sensibilities.
 Place a bench at the top or foot of the stairs to give weary house guests somewhere to sit. Reserve enough room beneath the bench to slide in a few separate containers for boots, jackets, scarves and other items that people tend to discard when they first come in. Alternatively, you could accompany smaller seats with end tables that provide a place to lay wallets, keys, papers and other paraphernalia.Look for settees, ottomans and similar pieces that double as storage compartments.
Combining your seating and storage will also help you keep up with everyone’s individual belongings.
 There’s no need to make extensive renovations to your home in order to seize on smart storage opportunities. Footwear can be tucked away in a minimalistic shoe rack or cubby right in the foyer, where they’ll remain neat and orderly rather than accumulating in the living room or muddying up the kitchen.Establish a new house rule that dirty shoes must be removed and put away upon entry.
If you have pets, put the rack above floor level to keep shoes out of reach.
 Imagine waking up in the morning and having your coat, purse, umbrella and car keys all held out to you on your way down the stairs. You can make it a reality by putting up a series of hooks and hangers at various heights on the wall alongside the main staircase. Mounted racks are inexpensive, unobtrusive and allow you to keep all your most frequently reached-for items together in plain sight.Hang a separate rack for each member of the household so that everyone has a place to put their things.

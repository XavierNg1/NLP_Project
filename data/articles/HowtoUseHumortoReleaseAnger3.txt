 Humor can be a powerful tool to help you gain perspective on a situation.Whether you are by yourself or with others, making a joke at your own expense is one way you can use humor to release anger. It can help relieve the tension of others and actually reduce your stress level, too.It’s always a good idea not to take yourself too seriously. Being able to laugh at yourself will help you avoid anxiety and anger.
For example, if you accidentally bump into a co-worker and make them spill their coffee, you could use humor to keep them from getting angry.
You might say something like, “If I was any clumsier I would be one of the Seven Dwarfs!”

, Don’t try to use humor to release anger by making fun of someone else.It’s okay to find humor in the situation. It’s not okay to say things that can hurt someone’s feelings, even if it is true or funny. Joking about someone can make the situation worse.


If the other person is already angry (or getting there), then making fun of them will probably make them angrier.
For example, calling your cousin “Dumbo ears” when she’s already getting upset will most likely start an argument.
Joking about the situation can help you (and other people) see the situation from a different perspective.
For instance, try helping your colleagues see the humor in your three hour ‘efficiency’ meeting at work.
 Some jokes or forms of humor may be funny to you, but inappropriate to others. Before you use humor to release anger, make sure that what you are saying won’t offend anyone.You should also consider the context of the situation. It may be okay to use humor in the situation, but make sure it is tasteful.


Avoid jokes about race, sexuality, religion, and politics. These areas can be very sensitive for some people.
Joking about death, tragedy, or trauma should be done with caution.
For example, making a joke about the grim reaper when your siblings are arguing at your dad’s funeral, isn’t very sensitive.

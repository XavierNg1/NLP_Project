 The fingerless wolf whistle is achieved through lip and tongue placement. Push your lower jaw forward slightly. Pull your bottom lip up over your teeth. Your bottom teeth should not be visible, but your upper teeth can be.


Your bottom lip should be snug against your lower teeth; if you need help with this movement, press your index and middle fingertip on either side of the mouth to draw your lip slightly out at the corners and over your lips., Draw back your tongue so that it is even with your lower front teeth and flat against the bottom of your mouth. This action also broadens and flattens the front edge of the tongue, yet there is still a space between the tongue and the lower front teeth. The sound of the whistle comes from air that is blown over the bevel, or a sharply angled edge, you create with your tongue and lips.As an alternative, flatten out your tongue so that the sides of your tongue are pressed against the edges of your back teeth. Roll the tip of your tongue down slightly, making a "U" shaped dip in the middle where air can pass out from behind your tongue., Using your upper lip and teeth, direct the air downwards and towards your lower teeth. The focus of the air is crucial for this technique. You should be able to feel the air on the underside of your tongue. And if your hold your finger below your lower lip, you should feel the downward thrust of air when you exhale., Your whistle may start out sounding breathy in a lower-volume that fades in and out, but don't worry. You just need to find the area of maximum efficiency, where the air is blown directly over the sharpest part of the bevel you've made in your mouth. Keep practicing to increase the volume of your whistle.Make sure you don't breath too much or too fast while you practice. You don't want to hyperventilate. If you take your time, you will have more breath to practice with.

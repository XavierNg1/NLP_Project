 Firefox is the most popular browser for adding extensions, and it can be downloaded for free from the Mozilla website. One of the highest-rated download extensions is the free DownloadHelper.


DownloadHelper will give you the option to download media files on any website you visit. This includes Flash movies and games. You can also use this extension for YouTube videos.
You can download standalone download managers that function similarly if you prefer to not use Firefox.
 Once the animation begins playing, the DownloadHelper icon will start rotating in the top-right corner of the window. A small arrow will appear next to it. Click the arrow to open a choice of download options.
 When you click the arrow, you will see a list of all of the media files on the page. If the animation had an advertisement, both will be listed. The animation may have a filename that doesn't match the title.
 Once you have selected the file, the download will begin. You can check the progress in the Downloads window in Firefox. This window can be accessed by clicking the Firefox menu and clicking Downloads.

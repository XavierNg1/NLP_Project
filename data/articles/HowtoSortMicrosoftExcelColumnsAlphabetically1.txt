 The header row is the top row of your spreadsheet, with the names of your columns. Excel will sometimes sort this row thinking it is part of your data, especially if your spreadsheet is entirely text. Here are a few ways to prevent this:


Format your header row differently. For example, bold the text or make it a different color.Make sure there are no blank cells in your header row.If Excel still screws up the sort, select the header row and use the top ribbon menu to click Home → Editing → Sort & Filter → Custom Sort → My data has headers.;
, You can click the header cell for that column, or the letter above it (A, B, C, D, etc.).
 Click Data in the top menu to view Data options in the ribbon menu above your spreadsheet.
 The ribbon menu is divided into related areas, with the name under each one. Look for the area labeled Sort & Filter.


If you don't see it on the Data menu, try returning to the Home tab and looking for a Sort & Filter button in the Editing section.
 To sort the spreadsheet in alphabetical order, just click the A → Z symbol in the Sort and Filter section. This will rearrange the spreadsheet in alphabetical order of the selected column. On most versions of Excel, this button is in the top left corner of the Sort and Filter section.


To sort it in reverse alphabetical order instead, click the Z → A symbol instead.

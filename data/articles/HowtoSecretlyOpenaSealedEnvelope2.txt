 Protecting the envelope from ice and moisture is essential, since these elements can cause it to warp. When an envelope gets wrinkled, it's a dead giveaway that it was tampered with.
 The very cold temperature in the freezer will cause the glue to lose its stick. You can keep it in the freezer for as long as you need to. Make sure it's in there for at least a few hours, or the glue might hold fast when you try to open the envelope.In order for this method to work, you must use the freezer, not the refrigerator. The refrigerator's temperature isn't cold enough to make the glue unstick.
If you don't have a freezer available, try placing the envelope in a plastic bag, then submerging it in a bowl full of ice water. This is quite risky, since a leak in the bag could cause water to flow inside and ruin the envelope and its contents.
 After a few hours in the freezer, you might be able to simply open the envelop with your fingers. If it doesn't easily pop open, use an envelope opener or a knife to gently open the flap. If the flap still won't budge, put the envelope back in the freezer overnight and try again., When you use the freezer method, the frozen glue loses its stick, but it gets tacky again when it thaws. To reseal the envelope, simply wait a few minutes for the envelope to warm up to room temperature, then press the flap shut. The envelope should now be sealed with no sign that it was ever opened.


If the flap won't stick when you try to reseal it, use a gluestick to keep it shut.
If you don't have a gluestick, use a very light application of white school glue or superglue to close it.

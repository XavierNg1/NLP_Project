 Instead of pictures in frames, do something slightly different. Print your photos on canvases. Photo canvases pop from the wall and give a modern look to your photographs.You can print photo canvases in different sizes or orientations.
 You can combine photos of you and your fiance with decorations to make a beautiful display. Place votive candles and flowers in vases next to your pictures, and add oversized letters of the two people’s initials.Match the decorations and frames. You can go for classic black and white, or you can do them in the wedding colors.
 For a unique decoration, leave a deck of photo playing cards on each table. Choose photographs of you and your partner from all ages, from babies to now, as the photographs on the cards.This will give the guests something fun to look and talk about at their tables.
Photo printing websites like Shutterfly offer this option.
 If your reception is outdoors near trees, use the trees to create a photo family tree. Hang the frames with photos of you and your fiance, along with wedding photos of family members, on the tree.You can mix the photos, or have one tree for your family and one for your partner’s family.
You can also circle the trees with twine and clip photos around the trees.

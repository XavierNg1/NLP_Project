 This is where the natural light shows. Imagine that there is a sun on the upper right corner of your sketch pad. You can put it any area on the upper part of your sketchpad so long as you know how to draw the shadows. Create a flat surface on your drawing pad. Draw a straight line that will serve as a ground surface. This also adds up to the train to see like an artist’ eyes that we have discussed earlier.
 We will use buildings as subject in drawing shadows.
, In here you will start to notice the difference between the artificial shadow and natural shadow. Natural shadows show when the light source comes from either the sun or the moon which are natural sources of light. Natural shadows have the same direction no matter how large the area is. It will only change if you go into the area where the natural light source’s light is directly facing the point of view of the artist. Examples are sunrise or sunset drawings where the sun is placed at the upper middle part of the landscape. That also applies on full moon drawings where the moon is placed at the middle of the landscape. On the other hand, artificial shadows are created with artificial lights like light bulbs, night lamps, spotlights, streetlights and so on.

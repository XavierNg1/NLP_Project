 The heat from the boiling water makes it easier to clean the kettle's exterior quickly. Use caution to avoid burning yourself. Metal transfers heat to the surface very quickly.
 Dip a sponge or cleaning cloth into the buttermilk or sour milk.Make sure that the sponge or cloth has a smooth texture that will not scratch the surface of the kettle.
 Rub the cloth or sponge gently over the surface. It is best to run in a circular motion with the grain of the metal.This will clean away blemishes and return the shine to the kettle.

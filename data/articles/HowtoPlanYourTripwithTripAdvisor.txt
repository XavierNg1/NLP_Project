, Part of planning a trip is deciding what hotel you want to stay at. Just click on the "Hotels" option under "Plan the perfect trip," and write the city you're traveling to/name of the hotel you're thinking of staying at, and the dates you're trying to plan, in the search boxes. Click on "Find Hotels" when you're done.


Find your planned hotel's pricing for the dates you're planning. To do this, click on "Price Your Stay" for whatever hotel you're looking at, then "Show Prices." This will direct you to booking.com to look at the booking prices.






You want to choose a hotel deal that's not too expensive, but is good quality and provides a relaxing environment.
 Type in the airport you're departing from, and the airport that you plan to arrive in, in the search box. Select the number of travelers that are going on the flight, and your planned trip dates. Click "Find Flights" to look at the flight deals and pricing.


Select "Prefer nonstop" if you prefer a flight without stops.
 You might prefer staying at a vacation rental rather than a hotel. Just click on the "Vacation Rentals" tab, write the city or region you plan to travel to, your check-in and check-out dates, and select the number of bedrooms you need. Click "Search" to browse the various vacation rental options.
 You can do this by clicking on "Restaurants," typing the city you're planning to travel to, selecting a restaurant cuisine, and selecting your price range.

 Don’t panic, it’s easier than it sounds. Every 3-4 hours from the time you wake up, eat a little something. Your digestive system is far more efficient at handling a series of small meals than it is at tackling one large meal. For example, you could eat at 7am, 10 am, 1pm, 4pm, 7pm and 10 pm. Limit your mini meals to 250-300 calories per meal.
, Here is a sample daily meal plan to get you started:

Meal one: Protein shake with 1% milk (whey protein drinks are also good)
Meal two: Half an apple and cottage cheese or yogurt
Meal three: Piece of chicken (no skin) and a small salad
Meal four: Cheese and the balance of the apple
Meal five: Piece of lean meat, rice or potatoes, vegetables
Meal six: Low fat chocolate pudding mixed with protein powder

, Whether you like pasta, cookies, ice cream, or chocolate. Don’t worry, you won’t gain fat if you do this because for the past six days your body has been used to eating "clean" food. On the seventh day your body thinks you are going to do the same and when you don't, it gets fooled and eliminates the effects of the "junk" food. In essence, you are tricking your body on your reward day but you must eat cleanly on the following day.

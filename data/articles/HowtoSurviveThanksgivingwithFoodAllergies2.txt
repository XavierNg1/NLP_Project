Raw vegetables and dip are always a hit. In addition to being healthy and typically allergy free, providing raw veggies as a snack will satiate the palate without filling the stomach.
If you have a dairy allergy and don’t want to have a ranch or milk-based dip, try hummus. You can create a sesame-free recipe (if that’s an issue) by simply omitting tahini.
 This is also a “free” starter as many green salads are safe for those with food allergies. Be sure that you select a dressing that does not contain any allergens. If you can have lemon, simply squeeze an entire lemon and 1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil into a dish. Whisk together, add sea salt and pepper for a refreshing, delicious dressing.
 Many turkeys offer broth/dressing that contain wheat, which may be dangerous to some.


If you have purchased a regular turkey from your grocer, omit the gravy packet (which typically includes wheat) and make your own gravy from scratch using “safe” ingredients.
 Part of what makes this dish especially delicious, heavy cream and butter will wreak havoc on someone with a dairy allergy.


Substitute dairy ingredients with chicken broth, rice milk, olive oil and salt and pepper. You can also add butter flavored grapeseed oil to give the potatoes that traditional butter flavor.
 In many cases, the pre-seasoned stuffing is often created from white bread cubes, but read the back of the package to ensure none of the seasonings will pose a danger to you.
 While it may be tempting to reach for the store-made cupcakes with unnatural flavoring and coloring, consider serving fresh fruit or a pie that contains no wheat, eggs, dairy or nuts.

 Tell your friend that you won't need any special props. You'll just ask him to add together numbers in his head.;
, Tell him to hold the answer in his head. He does not need to say it out loud.
 At this point, your friend should be thinking of 2040.
 Give your commands slowly. Allow your friend plenty of time to do the addition.
 We're up to 3070 now, assuming your friend hasn't made a mistake.
 Tell your friend to add 20, still keeping the number to himself.
 Say that you'll add 1000 one last time, and that you're nearly done. Your friend should now be thinking of 4090.
 Say "Now add 10 and tell me the answer." If your friend hesitates, encourage him by saying, "you know the answer, what is it?"

, Most people will answer "5000" but this is not the right answer! 4090 + 10 actually equals 4100. It's an easy mistake to make when speaking aloud, since the trick makes you think you're counting up to a big even number. You might need to write it on a piece of paper for your friend to believe it.

 glasses with cool water and set them on a table in front of you. The second glass is for just in case you finish the first one, if you really need it.
 Confidence and positive thinking are important here, so chill out and loosen up.
 Just after it hits, begin drinking slowly, steadily and continuously until the glass is empty.
 Hopefully you will have interrupted the rhythm of the hiccups, but if not then you will have to go to the second glass and repeat the process.
 By the time you've finished, the hiccups should be gone.

 When you use coffee or tea, it is most effective with items that can be placed in hot water.  It takes longer to dye items in cold coffee or tea.
  Pour the coffee or tea into the container.  For tea place the tea bags in hot water in the container and stir. Place the item in the dye bath.  Stir until completely saturated.  Check in 5 minute intervals until the item is slightly darker than the picture.  Remove and rinse and then hang to dry.

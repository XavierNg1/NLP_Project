 Look for the red circular icon named “Opera Mini” on the home screen or app drawer of your device. Tap it to open the Opera Mini browser.
 You’ll find the address bar at the top of the browser. When you’ve entered the keywords, tap “Go” on the keypad.
 There will be many web pages resulting from the keywords you entered; search through the list to find the web page you’re looking for.
 The link will be in blue. Tapping it will redirect you to the web page.


The loading time of the page will depend on your Internet speed and connectivity.
Wait until the web page loads completely before browsing the page.
 If you know the web address, or URL, of the website you would like to browse, tap the address bar and enter the address of the website (e.g., www.wikihow.com). Tap “Go” on the keypad to be redirected to the address you entered.
 If you want to visit different web pages simultaneously, just add browser tabs.


To add more tabs, tap the double-square icon with a number on it (which represents the number of tabs currently opened), and then tap the plus (+) icon. You can use the newly opened tab to search for other web pages or visit a web page directly, as described in Steps 2 to 5.
To switch between tabs, tap the double-rectangle icon to view a list of all the tabs opened in the browser. Select the tab you want to browse from the list.

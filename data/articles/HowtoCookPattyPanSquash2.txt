 Rinse the squash under running water and pat dry with clean paper towels. Use a sharp knife to cut each squash in half.


Note that you do not need to peel away the rind of the patty pan squash. The rind is thin and easy to eat, especially when working with small, immature squash.
 Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a large sauté pan. Add the shallots and cook until soft and clear.


Stir the shallots periodically using a spatula to prevent them from burning. It should only take 2 to 4 minutes for the shallots to cook.
 Add the squash to the shallots in the Sauté pan and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. The squash halves should be tender enough to pierce with a fork when ready.


Turn, rotate, and flip the squash every so often during the cooking process to ensure that each side cooks evenly.
 Sprinkle the squash with salt and pepper, to taste, before serving warm.

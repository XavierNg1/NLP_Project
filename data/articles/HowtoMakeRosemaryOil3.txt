 Fresh rosemary can be harvested from your own rosemary bush or purchased at the grocery store. Wash the sprigs of fresh rosemary under running water to remove dirt and debris. Pat the rosemary with a paper towel to remove excess water or use a salad spinner.


You will need three to four sprigs of rosemary to make one canning jar’s worth of rosemary oil.
Dried rosemary has a very long shelf life. Dry as much as you want, even if you don’t plan on using it all for rosemary oil.
 Line a large baking sheet with a large piece of parchment paper. Next, place the rosemary on the baking sheet in a single layer. If you overcrowd the rosemary, it won’t dry properly in the oven.
 Preheat your oven on the lowest setting for ten minutes. Next, place the baking sheet of rosemary in the oven. Let the rosemary bake for two to four hours.When the rosemary is done drying, it will crumble easily between your fingers.
Let the sprigs cool completely before making rosemary oil.

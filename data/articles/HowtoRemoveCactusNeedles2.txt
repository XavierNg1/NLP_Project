 Even though the big cactus spines might appear easy enough to grab out with your fingers, they often contain small hair-like needles known as glochids. Touching these even very lightly will get them stuck in your skin, and theyâ€™re much more difficult to remove than spines. Leave the spine, and stick to using tools to pull it out.
 Carefully pinch the base of the spine with the tweezers as close to the skin as you can get. Slowly pull out to remove the spine, pulling in the same direction as the spine.
 Because cactus spines are rather large, they often leave small puncture wounds that may or may not bleed. Regardless of any blood present, you should clean the wound so that it does not become infected. Use witch hazel or hydrogen peroxide to clean the cut; pour some onto a cotton pad, and dab it onto the cut. Use a bandaid or gauze pad to bandage the wound, if necessary.

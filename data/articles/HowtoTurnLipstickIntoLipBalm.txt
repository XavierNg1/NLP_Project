 Place all ingredients in a heat-proof bowl.
 Sit it in a steamer basket or steamer pan on top of the saucepan of boiling water. Stir while the ingredients melt over the heat., Being very careful, pour the hot liquid into lip balm pods and old lipstick pods.

This will make around 2 lipstick pods and 1 lip balm pod.
 Once cool, it will set hard and is ready for use.

The containers can be kept upright inside a cup or egg-carton.

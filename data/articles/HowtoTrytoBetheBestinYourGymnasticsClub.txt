 So if you are a level 4, try to focus on the fours. You can be the best in the club, but try it by level. If you are good enough, you will eventually improve to the top. Your coach will be proud of you no matter what level, because they will know you try hard to be the best.;
, As they say, practice makes perfect! Stretch at home, using the apparatus from class, but practice over-splits on stacks of books or benches. Practice the moves your learning on a trampoline, but be careful! Try nothing any harder then a double back. Try dance moves from your floor routine at home. Everything counts.
 Balance your diet and watch portions. You don't want to be the most unhealthiest gymnast, now do you?

, Ask questions, because questions will let them know you understand, and that you want to know more. However, there is a fine line between curiosity and not paying attention. Try to be alert and attentive, and raise your voice at the end of your question to sound curious and knowledgeable. Avoid words like "um" "uh" and "yeah".
 Waiting in a gym can be hard, especially if a friend or somebody you know is there. Avoid talking while the coach is speaking, do not look bored, and pay attention! The person your talking to may tell on you by the classic, "Excuse me, I didn't hear because 'so and so' was talking".
 If you ever feel something is wrong with your body, tell a coach or parent. Injuries must be reported to your coach and parents. Work hard, stay determined, and never give up, even if you are not the best.
 You need to work on certain skills, but do not push yourself too hard! You do not want to hurt yourself, because if you hurt yourself too badly, you might end up never doing gymnastics again.

 Only the bulbs of the kohlrabi should be stored in the freezer.
 Like storing kohlrabi in the fridge, it is important to wash the bulb before storing it for later use.


The peel of the kohlrabi bulb must be removed before the bulb can be eaten. If storing in the freezer, you must remove the peel before you freeze the bulb.
 Depending on your preference and intended use, you may leave your kohlrabi bulb whole or cut it into ½” cubes., By doing this, you stop the growth of enzymes in the kohlrabi bulb which would cause the bulb to lose color, flavor and nutrients.For whole kohlrabi bulbs, leave in the boiling water for 3 ½ minutes.
For ½” cubes, leave in the boiling water for 1 ½ minutes.
 Remove the bulb from the boiling water and immediately place it in ice water.
 Remove excess liquid from your bulb or cubes. Place them into an airtight, freezer-safe bag. Freeze immediately.Kohlrabi bulbs stored in this fashion in the freezer can keep for 10-12 months.

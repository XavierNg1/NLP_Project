 Figure out what you really need and what you won’t compromise on. These are your most valued priorities and non-negotiable things, such as your health, your children and so on. Once you establish what you absolutely need to live peacefully, then you can start to establish boundaries.The flipside is to determine where you’re flexible. What are you willing to compromise on, reduce or give up?

, When you need to get some space in order to process your own feelings and decompress, tell your loved ones. Communicating your own needs will help your partner, for example, understand why you are pulling away briefly. When this person understands your motivations, your relationship can strengthen while you get the space you need., When you are confronted with a difficult situation, you may find yourself relaxing your boundaries too much. If you plan out your response in advance, you’ll be able to hold the line better.


For example, how will you respond when a friend needs an ear to listen to complaints about work?You might say, “I am happy to hear about your work situation, but I only have 10 minutes to talk today.” Then stick to that 10 minutes.
In another example, say you have a coworker who always leaves projects to the last minute, and you pick up the slack to minimize their stress. You might establish a boundary by saying, “I have my own work to complete at this time. I’m sorry, but I can’t help you right now.”

, Knowing how much you can stand and obeying that limit is vital to ensure your mental well-being. Set kind but meaningful boundaries with others who overwhelm you.


For example, don't stand around listening to someone talk for two hours when you can only cope with 30 minutes. Make your excuses and leave the situation.

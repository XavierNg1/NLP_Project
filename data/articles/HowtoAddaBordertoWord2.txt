 Normally, a page border will apply to every page in the document. If you want the border to just apply to specific pages, or want different borders for different pages, you'll need to split your document into "Sections."Place your cursor at the end of the page before the page you want your new section to start on.
Open the Layout tab and click the Breaks button. You'll find this in the Page Setup group.
Select "Next Page" in the Section Breaks section. This will start the next section on the next page.
 The Page Borders tool can be found on this ribbon.
 This is on the far-right end of the Design tab, in the Page Background section. The Page Borders window will appear.
 Use the Style selector to find the line style that you want to use. The Color menu allows you to change the color of the line. The Width line allows you to change the thickness of the line. The Art menu allows you to select from a variety of clip art pieces that will repeat as a border.
 By default, the page border will go around all of the sides of the page. Click the buttons around the preview to toggle sides off or on.
 The "Apply to" menu allows you to select between "Whole document" or "This section." If you broke your document into separate sections in the first step, you can use this to apply different borders to different sections.
 You'll see your border appear immediately.

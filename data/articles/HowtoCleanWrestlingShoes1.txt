 For as long as there have been wrestlers, they have had to deal with various communicable skin conditions like ringworm and impetigo, as well as other viral, fungal, and bacterial illnesses. Unfortunately, contaminated shoe bottoms are one of the major culprits for spreading germs and disease.Whether you’re a wrestler, coach, official, or parent, make it the rule that wrestling shoes must be disinfected properly before a wrestler can set foot on the mat.;
, To disinfect wrestling shoes, use a low level disinfectant spray or cleaner with virucidal, fungicidal, and bactericidal properties. Lysol Brand IC is a popular choice, but brand names are less important than the ingredients and disinfecting properties.Follow the product instructions precisely for mixing and using the solution, and regarding how much and how long it takes to properly disinfect a surface.
 While you can wipe down the entire pair of shoes, the main problem area tends to be the soles on the bottom. Wrestling shoes that are regularly washed and properly maintained don’t necessarily need to be disinfected from top to bottom every time. But treat the soles of even the cleanest, newest shoes as contaminated until they have been properly disinfected on the spot., While spraying or wiping down the shoes at the mat’s edge and then putting them on will work, it’s not always the most convenient option. Instead, place towels that have been saturated in the disinfecting solution at the edge of the mat, and have each wrestler thoroughly clean their shoe soles on this makeshift doormat.You can also purchase doormat-type products made to clean the bottoms of wrestling shoes and apply disinfectant.

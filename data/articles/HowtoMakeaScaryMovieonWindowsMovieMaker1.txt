 Since you are making this on Windows Movie Maker, it's best to know not to film the whole movie in one scene (duh). Instead, film it into different scenes and give each scene a specific name you can remember. Make sure they are short and simple so you can carefully arrange them to your liking. Example: Make one scene of someone just screaming or a scene where your just walking through the graveyard. Also, if you have a sound recorder, record some creepy music or hissing sounds. This way, you can add sound to a regular scene.

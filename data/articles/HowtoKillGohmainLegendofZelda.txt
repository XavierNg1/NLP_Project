 Go inside the Boss Room of these levels by unlocking it using the Boss Keys you got while playing through the dungeons. Gohma can be found in the Boss Rooms of the following levels of these game versions only:


The Legend of Zelda (first version) – “Dragon Labyrinth” (level 6 dungeon).
Link’s Awakening – “Catfish’s Maw” (level 5 dungeon).
Ocarina of time – “Great Deku Tree” (level 1).
Oracle of Seasons – “Dancing Dragon Dungeon” (level 4 dungeon).
Four Swords – Inside Mini Boss Rooms of various dungeons.
Twilight Princess – “Temple of Time” level.;
, The moment you enter the Boss Room, Gohma will begin attacking you using its two front legs. Avoid this attack by simply running around the Boss Room.
 After three or more consecutive claw leg attacks, the giant spider will then blow a breath of fire at you. This fire breath will last around 3 seconds and will trail you wherever you go. Keep running around the room like what you’ve been doing in step 2 until the fire breath stops to avoid getting damaged.
 After attacking you with its fire breath, it will pause for at least three seconds and letting its guard down. Quickly turn around and shoot at the spider’s singular eye using your bow and arrow.


After damaging its eye, Gohma will resume attacking you again. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you get the chance to shoot its eye again. Keep doing this for at least five times or more until you defeat the monster.

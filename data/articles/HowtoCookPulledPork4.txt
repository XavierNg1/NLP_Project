 It's easiest to use a big, wide, shallow pan for this job.
 Use two forks to shred the pork meat into bite-sized pieces. Continue shredding the pork until the entire pork shoulder has been reduced to a pile of shredded pork. Mix the crust and the inside of the roast together as you go.
 Pulled pork is classically served with barbecue sauce either as a main dish or as a sandwich on a bun. Serve with a side of coleslaw and baked beans.

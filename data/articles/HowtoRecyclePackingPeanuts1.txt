 If you receive a package with packing peanuts, inquire as to whether the company will take them back. They are likely to agree as they will be able to reuse them for another customer, saving the company money.;
, Though you likely cannot recycle packing peanuts in your bins at home or at the local drop-off center, there are places you can drop them off for recycle.


The Alliance of Foam Packaging Recyclers has a list of places to drop-off packing peanuts by state (U.S. only) on the AFPR website: http://www.epspackaging.org/images/stories/Drop_Off_Recycling_Locations_512.pdf.
The Plastic Loose Fill Council also lists drop-off locations by state (U.S. only). See their website for more information: http://www.loosefillpackaging.com/search/default.asp


, Though you may have to pay for shipping, many companies, such as the EPS Industrial Alliance, will take your packing peanuts for free.

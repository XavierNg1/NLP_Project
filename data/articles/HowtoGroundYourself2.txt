 Dry, cold environments with low humidity levels generate a higher level of static electricity. Consider using a humidifier in your home or office to achieve between 35 and 50 percent humidity.
 Wool and synthetic fabrics such as polyester, rayon, and spandex are more prone to rub together and create friction and static electricity.
 Dry skin causes static buildup, and can even cause your clothing to rub against your skin repeatedly. Drink plenty of water, and apply lotion or moisturizer to your skin as needed to prevent and treat dryness.
 This allows sparks from the discharge to affect the metal object, and not your skin. For example, touch a doorknob using a key instead of your hand at first to lower the risk for electric shock.

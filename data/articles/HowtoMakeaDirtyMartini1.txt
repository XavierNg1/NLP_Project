 The shaker should be filled about half to three-quarters full, which will briefly chill the drink as it's mixed.;

 Like most drinks, many bartenders have differing opinions on how long to shake a dirty martini. The longer your shake, the colder the drink will be, but coldness also dampens flavor, making this a delicate balancing act. At least five seconds is a must,and 10-15 is a good middle ground, but some bartenders shake for up to thirty seconds., Make sure you strain out the ice, as a dirty martini is never served on the rocks. This is why pre-chilling the glasses is such a big part of a successful drink.
 Stab 3-4 olives onto a toothpick and let them soak in the martini. They'll soak up some alcohol and provide a delicious treat when your drink is done.

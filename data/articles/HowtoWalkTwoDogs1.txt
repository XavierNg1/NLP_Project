 You want to train each dog to obey the leash pull signal first before getting them together.Remember to carry necessary supplies with you as you would for any dog walk such as the leash, water, poop scoop, and disposal bag.
Typically, you should walk up front with your dog. This won't be as easy when walking two dogs at once, but will be better for the training phase.
Think about using a shorter leash during this phase if you need more handling control of each dog.
Allow for 30 minutes to one hour for the walk.;
, You want to do this for one dog at a time.As you proceed with the walk, if the dog shows signs of pulling, you need to stop walking.
Resume the walk when the leash goes slack again.
 If you keep doing this during the session then the dog should learn that it can only move when the leash is loose.Make sure anyone who walks the dog knows to use this technique so the lesson is reinforced.
 This training method should be used even in situations other than the daily walk--whenever the leash is on.This will allow both dogs to continually absorb the lesson and get comfortable with walking calmly with the leash without pulling.
 This is positive reinforcement to the leash lesson, but should not be excessively long in duration.Allow the dog to relieve themselves, and sniff in safe areas during the walk. But don't let this go on too long.
Set a meal and water for the dog as a reward when returning home.

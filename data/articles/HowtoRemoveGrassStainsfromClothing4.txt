 If you’ve got a particularly stubborn grass stain, try using a homemade stain remover. Mix ¼ cup bleach, ¼ cup peroxide and ¾ cups cold water into a container. The combination of hydrogen peroxide with bleach will work as an incredible stain remover.When working with bleach and peroxide, mix in a well-ventilated area to prevent inhalation of fumes.
Never substitute bleach with ammonia. Ammonia is known to immediately set a stain.Bleach is known to change the color of a garment. Always spot test on an inconspicuous location before applying the mixture to the stain., Place your homemade solution onto the stained area. Allow it to saturate the stain. Next, massage it in gently. Once you’ve massaged for several minutes, put the garment somewhere safe and allow it to sit. Ideally your solution can sit on your clothing for 30-60 minutes, but longer is better., Once your item has finished sitting, give it a thorough rinse. Check to see if the stain has disappeared. If there is still traces, feel free to apply your DIY-remover again. If it is gone, you can launder the clothing as normal.

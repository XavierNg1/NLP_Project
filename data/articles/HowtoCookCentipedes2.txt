 If you decide to grill the centipede, you'll need to start with a few things. You need a skewer about the length of the centipede, or more. Also, other assorted meats go well with the unique texture of the centipede. Conventional Western meats work, like chicken or turkey. It's not recommended to pair red meats with centipedes as the taste of the red meat will overpower the centipede taste.
 Prepare a sauce for the end of the grilling process to add flavor. Consider popular grilling sauces such as barbecue sauce, Sriracha, or fish sauce. You can make barbecue sauce too!
, A low temperature, around 90Â°C is optimal for grilling. It's important to have a steady heat so that the centipede is cooked thoroughly., Depending on your preferences, you can choose to sear one side or you can cook it evenly. If cooking evenly, make sure one side is not facing the heat for more than 30 seconds. It's best to rotate it twice a minute. If you choose to sear it, 1 minute on one side should be enough., Wait until the last few seconds of grilling to brush on sweet sauces. Otherwise it's possible that the sugar in the sauce will burn up before the centipede is done.

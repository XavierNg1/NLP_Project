 This is a great gift to give your teacher at the end of the year. Write about how much your teacher taught you in the last year and how much they mean to you. Describe one or two of your favorite class memories. If it’s a teacher you especially loved, you could add a few lines about something they did that helped you grow and become a better person in the last year.Put your letter in a nice envelope.
Wait until one of the last days of the school year and leave the letter on your teacher’s desk.
 This is a project that the whole class can participate in. Get a sheet of nice card stock and start a list of reasons why you and your classmates are thankful for your teacher. Encourage everyone to list 1 or 2 reasons they feel that way on the nice paper.Once it’s done, put the list in an attractive frame.
Leave it on your teacher’s desk or hang it on the wall.
 This is another activity that the whole class should participate in. Come up with 3 basic questions about your teacher and pass them out to everyone in the class. Encourage everyone to answer the questions in their best handwriting and be sure to give everyone a few days to finish it. Once everyone has finished, collect all of the answers and get your classmates to help you arrange them in a book, along with any photos or drawings that anyone would like to submit.Decorate the book and present it to your teacher as a class.

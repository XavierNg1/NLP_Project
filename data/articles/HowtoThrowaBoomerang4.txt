 The type of boomerang you buy will have a significant impact on whether you will get it to come back to you or not. Boomerangs are made from regular pieces of wood or plastic, so it takes some skilled workmanship to imbue such everyday materials with the aerodynamic qualities that make boomerangs so unique.


There are loads of boomerangs on the market, but not all of them are true returning boomerangs, so do your research before you buy.
 Pick one that is made from lightweight materials. These boomerangs do not require a strong throw, which allows beginners to focus more on technique. They will usually travel between 10 to 25 meters (32.8 to 82.0 ft) before returning., Once you have mastered the throwing technique and your boomerang is consistently returning, you can move on to intermediate and, later, advanced boomerangs. These boomerangs tend to be heavier, come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and can travel distances of up to 50 meters (164.0 ft) before returning., Be aware that you will need either a left-handed or right-handed boomerang depending on your dominant hand. If you're left-handed, you will have considerable difficulty in throwing a right-handed boomerang with any success.

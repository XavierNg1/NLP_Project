 Acetaminophen is recommended for the first two days after you tear a muscle because it is less likely to increase bleeding.Then, you can switch to an NSAID, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, after the first two days.
 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, can help to rehabilitate your torn muscle. Take recommended doses of Ibuprofen or Aspirin for 3-7 days after the injury. Don’t take NSAIDs for a longer time period than this or you may suffer from long term side effects such as upset stomach.NSAID medications stop pain, but also may stop a phase of chemical reactions that are important in long-term healing.Many doctors recommend their use starting 48 hours after the injury.
Take ibuprofen or naproxen with food and a glass of water to avoid gastric complications such as ulcers. Be careful if you have asthma, as anti-inflammatory drugs can make an asthma attack more likely., You can get prescription NSAID creams to rub onto the skin over the torn muscle. These creams work locally to reduce pain and swelling in the muscle.Apply the cream to the affected area only and use the medicine as directed by your physician.
Make sure that you wash your hands immediately after applying the cream to the affected area.
 If your injury is severe, then you may experience severe pain as well. In this case, your doctor may prescribe a pain reliever, such as codeine.Keep in mind that these medications can be habit-forming and they are much stronger than over-the-counter medicines. Follow your doctor’s instructions for dosage carefully.

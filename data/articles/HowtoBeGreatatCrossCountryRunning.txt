 Stay in good physical fitness during the winter (possibly by running indoor track) and the spring (possibly by running outdoor track).;
, Build a good cardiovascular base.


Starting in August, during a regular training week, you should be running at least 5 miles a day at a decent fast pace, a hills workout on Saturday (8-10 miles in the hills is a good workout), and at least 2 tempo runs (20-40 minutes).
 If you feel yourself burning out or getting injured, rest is your friend. During the season, every week you should be taking at least 1 day of rest.
 Learn how to take deep breaths to get the most oxygen to your lungs.
 To prevent soreness and injuries, remember to warm up and stretch before you begin training or a meet. Cool-down by jogging slowly for at least 7 minutes, then stretch.
 Be sure to eat a healthy, balanced diet, and consume an adequate amount of protein within an hour of working out. The night before a race it is traditional to have pasta, as has lots of energy for your body to use during the race.
 Usually meets start in September and run through October and November.
 Be sure to have a fast enough start that you won't be slowed by the pack, but not so fast that you run out of energy. As you run pace yourself don't speed off too fast at the start so your out of breath by time you're halfway. Go at the same pace through out your race until you see the finish line, then go into an all out sprint (if you can't go any faster near the finish line keep your pace).
 It's fine to push yourself in a race, but listen to your body during training.
 Have fun running and don't get all "I need to beat you!" This will get people annoyed and it's not a very healthy mindset to be in, anyway.

 Sun damage is a primary cause of aging. It can speed the development of wrinkles, cause inflammation in your skin, induce the development of skin cancer, and spread unsightly and painful burns over your body.The best way to protect against sun damage is to wear sunscreen every day. Apply at least SPF 30 sunscreen to your body and on your face before you apply makeup.


Many BB creams, foundations, and concealers contain SPF 15 sunscreen. Consider your complexion carefully. If you have a pale complexion, SPF 15 may not be sufficient to protect your skin, and you should still apply a layer of sunscreen beneath your makeup.
 Before you apply your foundation or concealer, use a matte primer on clean, moisturized skin. With either a sponge or clean fingers, gently spread the primer over your face. Primer will smooth over lines, and it will keep your makeup looking fresh all day.You can apply your normal foundation and concealer after the primer.
 One trick for glowing makeup is to mix a small amount of bronzer with your normal foundation or BB cream before application. Pour your foundation on the back of your clean hand and apply a dab of bronzer. Mix with your makeup brush before application., Another way to add some shine to your face without looking greasy is to use a liquid shimmer highlighter. With your ring finger, gently dab the highlighter over the crest of your cheeks and top of your nose. Use a very small amount. Blend into your normal makeup with a powder brush.
 If left on, makeup can clog your pores and cause outbreaks of acne. It can also make your skin look duller overnight. Remove your makeup every night, either with a makeup remover wipe, cream, or cleanser. After you wipe off your makeup, wash your face.

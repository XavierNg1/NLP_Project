 Add the par-cooked ramen noodles, green onion, pickled ginger, fried shiitake mushrooms, carrot, peas, soy sauce, sesame seed oil, vegetable bouillon cube, and spicy chili oil to a heatproof glass jar that holds at least 4 cups (1 liter) and has a lid. Make to sure to place the ingredients in the jar in the proper order.Par cooking the noodles means slightly undercooking them.
You can substitute spaghetti for the ramen noodles if you prefer.
If you don’t want spicy noodles, you can omit the spicy chili oil.
 After you’ve added all of the ingredients to the jar, seal it closed with the lid. Place the jar in the refrigerator until you are ready to eat the noodles.The noodles will keep in your refrigerator for 3 to 4 days.
If you’re packing the noodles for lunch, make sure to include a cold pack.
 When you’re ready to eat the noodles, remove the lid from the jar. Add boiling water to it to just cover all of the noodles and vegetables. Cover the jar, and let the noodles sit for 2 to 3 minutes.Make sure to let the noodles steep for at least 2 minutes, so the vegetable bouillon cube has time to dissolve.
 After the noodles have sat in the boiling water for a few minutes, remove the lid. Use a spoon to stir the mixture well, and enjoy.

 Legally, even if you are on contract, your employer cannot force you to stay.You are a free person and you can make the choice to leave.
 If your boss refuses to let you leave, you may have to assume that the bridge between you is already burned. There may be no way for you to walk away from this with a good reference, but that is not a good reason to stay.Your skills and experience will come with you, even if a good reference does not.


There are laws that govern what a former employer can disclose to a future one. These laws vary by state., The way your boss is acting should solidify the fact that itâ€™s time to quit.In a good working relationship, an employer would not use guilt, coercion, or simple refusal to listen. This must not be a positive work relationship, so let it go.
 Before you actually walk out the door, it is a good idea to let your clients and other work contacts know.It may not be possible (or even ethical) for you take clients with you, but it is courteous to give them a heads up. Again, this will help you preserve your reputation, no matter what your boss says about you later.
 If all else fails, just walk right out the door. You are free to leave already! Even providing two-weeks notice is really just a courtesy. Pick up your things, and move on with your life.

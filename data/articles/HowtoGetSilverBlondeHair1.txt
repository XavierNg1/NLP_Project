 Virgin hair is best for achieving the platinum blonde look – this means all dye should be grown out of your hair. It might take a while. Hair grows about ½ inch per month, so you’ll have about 3 inches of virgin roots in 6 months and 6 inches in a year. If you’ve dyed your hair recently or still have dark ends, you may find it has an orange tinge after bleaching., For best results, you should get a professional deep conditioning treatment. If this is out of your price range, use a couple deep conditioning hair masks in the weeks leading up to bleaching., Your body’s natural oils will help protect it from the bleach. Your hair will inevitably be damaged by the bleaching process, but going into it with freshly washed hair can make it a lot worse.

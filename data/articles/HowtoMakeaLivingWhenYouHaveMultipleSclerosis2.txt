 Each state has a vocational rehabilitation office. The purpose of this office is to aid people with disabilities so they can continue working. When you contact the office, you can work with a vocational rehabilitation counselor, who can help you come up with a plan to find a way to continue working in a productive way.The plan you will develop with your vocational rehabilitation counselor is called an Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP). This plan outlines goals, accommodations, and ways you can continue working with your MS.
The vocational rehabilitation office can help you find any government funding or grants that may cover the cost of accommodations, such as computerized voice software or motorized scooters.
 Due to your MS, you may be eligible for Social Security Disability benefits. To receive benefits, you must meet certain criteria set by the Social Security Administration that demonstrate you are unable to work. These criteria include:Functional disorganization in two or more of your arms and legs
Loss of manual dexterity which prohibits repetitive actions
Visual impairment
Conditions that limit physical mobility
If you have been denied Social Security Disability or you are unsure how to go about seeking aid, you can talk to a SSD attorney or advocate who can help you.
 If you are finding it difficult to perform your job duties because of your MS, you may consider going to see an occupational health doctor or an occupational therapist. These professionals work with a person to understand how their health affects their work, and vice versa.An occupational professional may be able to help you work on your physical functions so you can continue working for as long as possible.

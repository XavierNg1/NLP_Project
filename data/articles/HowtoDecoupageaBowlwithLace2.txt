 The lace or eyelet fabric will need to fit the bowl exactly, so take precise measurements of the diameter or area you're planning to cover.


To make sure that the template will fit properly on the bowl/item, hold it up to compare.
 You may want to measure and re-measure to ensure the perfect fit. Once the lace or eyelet fabric has been cut out, hold it up to the bowl to see how it will look before you decoupage it.
 Cover the surface evenly so the fabric can be applied smoothly.
 Since the Mod Podge is still pliable, you will be able to move the fabric into place to achieve the desired look.
 Allow it to dry. Depending upon the humidity levels, drying time can take up to several hours.
 The lace decoupaged bowl or item will make an excellent display item. These can also be made to give away as gifts or to sell at school fundraisers.

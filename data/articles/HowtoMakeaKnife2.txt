 There are many different kinds and grades of steel. Do not use stainless steel, as the metal is difficult to work with and the blade will not be as fine. 01 is a popular carbon steel for blade making because it is easy to douse when hot.


Try to get a slab or bar between 1/8 to Â¼ inch thick.
 Wood is an easy one to work with, though you can make a handle out of anything you would like. Since this guide is for a full tang knife, pick a material that you can attach with rivets. G10, micarta, and kirinite all are good choices and are waterproof.
 Using a permanent marker, trace your blade onto the slab. This will be the guide you use when you cut the steel. Be sure to trace the tang as well, because the blade and tang are one connected piece.


Make adjustments to the size as necessary once you see the outline on the metal.
 You will need a hacksaw, an angle grinder with a hard wheel and flap wheel, a vise, a drill, and protective wear also a few other tools you could have are bandsaw and a grizzly or KMG grinder. You will need several replacement blades for the saw.

 If you are not confident with kicking the ball long distances, look for a patch of grass that's slightly higher and smoother to place the ball. If you choose the damaged part of the ground which is lower, it will make it harder to kick the bottom of the ball and get the lift you need, you also risk kicking the ground and injuring yourself.;
, Some people prefer longer run ups for longer distances but do what feels comfortable and right, really you only need to take a couple of steps.

Take odd number (3, 5 or 7) of steps back and move right/left (1 or 2 steps) according to your shooting foot.
Just relax and don't rush. If you panic, your ball will be low or wide.
 Move at a steady pace so you can add power to your kick whilst still being in control.

First look where is your team player standing.
Then keep your eye on lower part of ball until the last moment.
Plant your non-kicking foot to the side of the ball, still giving yourself enough room to swing your other foot.
 Kick using the inside of your foot. Actually you use the part of your thumb bone. Lean backwards to get the ball to go higher. Use your foot as a wedge. To kick more precisely, kick slightly below the middle of the ball (to get that flying like result). Remember to kick the ball straight forward like a golfer's wedge swing.


If you want to curve the ball, kick the ball at the same part like above, but your foot should be approaching with a round like motion.

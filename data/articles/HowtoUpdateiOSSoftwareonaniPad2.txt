 In order to download update software for your iPad, iTunes must be running the latest version available.
 In most cases, updating will not cause you to lose any data and settings. Things go wrong occasionally however, so you should make sure you have a backup made before you begin updating.
 Use the USB cable that came with your iPad. iTunes should open automatically when you connect your iPad. If it does not, open iTunes.
 This is located in the upper-right corner of the iTunes window. If your iPad does not appear in the Devices section, try restarting the iPad.
 Scroll down to your iPad and click Check for Update. If there is an update available, iTunes will ask you if you want to download and install it.
 Click Download and Update. iTunes will automatically begin downloading the update and will install it after the download is complete. Leave your iPad plugged in the entire time during the download and install process.iTunes must stay connected to the internet during the entire process.

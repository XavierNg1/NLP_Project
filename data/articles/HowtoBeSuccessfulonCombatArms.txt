 That means for you to watch your front, sides, and back. There could already be somebody behind you ready to slit your neck with their knife.;
, Just pressing "Enter" to bring up to the chat line and saying a quick "lol" or "omg" can get you killed. Try it when you're alive only if your under deep-deep-deep cover or you have a teammate to guard you.
 If you are on Combat Arms a lot, you know how frustrating it is to have some guy on the other team that kills everyone on your team at once...with a knife! Hacking will most certainly get you banned, and they won't give you a second chance! Besides, if you hack you will be kicked out of the game room and you won't get any EXP or GP. There is no point in hacking.
 If you accidentally shoot a random spot in a wall and all of your opponents die at once, report the bug to Nexon IMMEDIATELY. Exploiting a bug/glitch on purpose for your own gain is as serious as hacking.
 You still get XP and GP, no matter what!

, If you are kinda bad with grenades, don't buy a load of grenades! Buy a few grenades and experiment with them.

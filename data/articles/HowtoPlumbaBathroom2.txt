Once the plumbing in your bathroom is complete, you may still run into problems in the future.
To unclog a toilet, press a plunger against the hole and push the plunger up and down.
If that does not work, you can use a closet auger, which has a coil at the end that goes into the toilet, and a handle at the other end which makes the coil go deeper into the pipes.



If your sink clogs, you can use the plunger or with an auger.
You can also clean out the trap under the sink by removing the cover to the trap. It will be located at the bottom of the pipe right before it enters the wall.
Stick a hanger or a wire through the trap to see if you can pull anything out. If that does not work, disconnect the pipe using a wrench and clean it out using detergent.



Remove the strainer for the floor drain and push the hose into it as far down as it will go.
Stuff rags around the hose at the drain entrance to close up the hole.
Turn the water on at full force and then turn it off again.
Continue turning it on and off until the water flows freely through it.



For the bathtub drain, unscrew the overflow plate and lift it out. Run the coil for the auger through the pipe to unclog the drain.

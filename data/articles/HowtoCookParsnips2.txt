 Trim the root and leaf ends of 6 parsnips. Scrub them with a vegetable brush as you rinse them under cool water. Then, peel them and use a knife to quarter them lengthwise., Cover the saucepan.
 Boil them until they are tender. After 7 minutes, you can check them by poking them with a fork. When they are boiled, drain them to remove the water.
 Place 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour and 1/2 tsp. of seasoning salt in a sealable plastic bag and shake it to combine the ingredients.
 To coat the parsnips, shake the bag to toss them with the seasoned flour.
 It should take about one minute for the butter to be heated enough to sizzle.
 After 2-3 minutes, turn them over with a spatula to cook both sides evenly. If they still need more time to be tender and golden brown, keep flipping them over or gently turning them with a fork until they are ready.
 Enjoy these fried parsnips while they are hot. You can use them as a replacement to French fries and pair them with a sandwich.

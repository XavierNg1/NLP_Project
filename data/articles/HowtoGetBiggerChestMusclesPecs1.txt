 This often-neglected exercise focuses on building up your shoulder and upper chest muscles.

Push your body up from the floor with your hands until your elbows are straight, then lower yourself until your arms reach a 90 degree bend.

, This is the most popular chest building exercise of all time, and for good reason. Load a barbell with weights appropriate for your strength level.

Lower the barbell down to chest until you reach about 1" from your chest, then lift it straight above your chest.









To build muscle mass and hypertrophy it is best to do between 8-12 reps of 1-3 sets.

 If you notice that the area where the horn bud was is bleeding, apply pressure to the area using folded gauze pads. After several minutes of applying pressure, the bleeding should subside.


If the bleeding does not subside, you can use a hot iron to cauterize the area, or you can call a veterinarian.
 It is important to try to keep the dehorned area from becoming infected. It is particularly important to keep flies from landing on the area, as they can carry diseases and bacteria. Use fly repellents to keep the pests away.


Two different kinds of fly repellents that can be used in this instance are gusanex and negasunt.
 To keep the wound from getting infected, you can place gauze pads over the wound. However, these pads must be changed daily for ten days.


You can use an antibacterial dressing along with the gauze pads to give the cow extra protection against infection.

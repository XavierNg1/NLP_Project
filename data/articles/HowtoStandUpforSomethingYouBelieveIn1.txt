 Part of standing up for what you believe in is learning to be courageous. Courage doesn't mean you're not afraid. Many courageous people are afraid, but they act anyway because they know it's important. If you really believe in your cause, you need to act on it despite your fear.Part of being courageous is picking a side. It's hard to act in the moment if you don't know what you stand for. For instance, if you don't know whether you're for or against an issue, such as spending taxpayer money on animal welfare, you may find yourself not wanting to speak up in conversation because you're on the fence. However, if you know where you stand, you'll be more inclined to speak about it.
Other people may disagree with you, so be prepared to stand your ground no matter what others think.
Don't be afraid to ask for help. Sometimes, you'll lean on others to find your courage, and that's okay. The more people you have behind you, the braver you'll feel.
Focus on who you'll be helping. Often, when you're standing up for what you believe in, you're doing so to help others. Focusing on how they will benefit can help you feel more courageous.;
, If you're like most people, you likely commit small acts of bravery throughout your day without even realizing it, especially if you are a bit reserved. For instance, maybe you've been dreading a phone call you need to make, and you finally pluck up the courage and do it. Take a moment to acknowledge that you've shown a small act of courage. These small acts can inspire you to be braver in other areas, such as when you need to stand up for a belief., Putting your beliefs into action often means standing up for others who can't stand up for themselves. Sometimes people are unwilling or unable to speak up for themselves, and you need to step in. If you are going to say you believe in compassion, for instance, you must put it into practice when you see people in trouble.


For instance, you may need to step in when you see someone being bullied. Try to stop the bullying in its tracks by interrupting what the person is saying or by trying to separate the bully from the victim. If you're a kid, don't be afraid to ask an adult to help. Also, make sure the person is okay, mentally and physically. Get the person help if they need it., Conviction is a feeling of certainty in your beliefs.Knowing that you're on the right side of an issue makes it easier to stand up in the face of opposition. Challenges will come, but you can withstand them if you are firm in your belief.

Standing up for someone may make you a target. If you stop a bully, the bully may turn their attention to you.
When people challenge your belief, they are testing it. If you back down, then they will see it as a weakness in your position.
 Part of putting your beliefs into action is speaking when you see something that goes against your core values. Now is the time you start standing up, when something is going on near you that you have the power to change. Take a deep breath, and speak up.Suppose you are out with some male friends and one of them makes a derogatory comment about an attractive woman nearby. You can ignore it or choose to take a stand. Ask your friend, “Is that how you try to get dates?” or “How would you like if I talked to your sister like that?”
By not ignoring behavior you find troubling, you can help spark conversation and possibly accelerate change.
Remember that silence is its own position. When you are silent, you give your approval for what's happening. When there is a conflict around you, if you stay silent, people will think you agree with the status quo., When you speak up, how you say things matters. That is, if you get angry, other people tend to just hear the anger, not what you're saying. Plus, you're giving others permission to get angry, too. If you stay calm, you may be able to actually convince people to hear what you're saying, instead of just tuning you out.
 If you're going to stand up for what you believe in, you may need to make some sacrifices at times. You may lose some "coolness" points because people don't think the same way you do. You may even lose some friends or acquaintances. That doesn't mean you should beat people over the head with your values. Rather, sometimes when you stand up for a value, acquaintances may decide they don't share the same values.It can be hard, but putting your beliefs first will help you become a moral person.


If you go against your beliefs, eventually your self-worth will suffer because you aren't being true to yourself. You'll have higher self-esteem if you live according to your own values.Don't let situations compromise your values. For instance, if you are in a job that asks you to do things that go against your personal values, you may need to find a new job.
 When it comes to standing up for your beliefs with friends and family members, you may find it harder to do. You value those relationships, and so you may not want to disagree with the people you care about. However, you can still disagree in a calm and reasonable manner without it blowing up into a huge argument.First of all, it's fine to state your beliefs. You have a right to believe what you want to believe, even if it conflicts with what people near you believe. When you do state what you believe, make sure you do so calmly and have facts to back up what you say. That way, you can answer questions. In addition, try not to go into the discussion with the mindset of "winning." It should be a conversation, with both of you giving and taking.
When discussing your beliefs, your goal should be to have your voice heard rather than to "win" an argument or change the other person's beliefs or actions.
If the person is willing to discuss it with you, particularly if the person is on the fence, present your case for your side in a clear, logical way. Also, be willing to listen to what the other person has to say. That means actually hearing their side and concerns, not just preparing a counterargument. As you discuss, make it a point to try to find things that you both agree on. Often, you'll find common ground somewhere.
If the discussion gets heated, decide if you want to get in a fight over it. You've stated what you believe, so getting in an argument will likely not resolve anything or change the person's mind. You may just want to back out of the discussion by saying, "Let's agree to disagree." You don't have to permanently damage a relationship just because you disagree with someone. On the other hand, if you disagree with someone on many core values, you may find you want to spend less time with them.

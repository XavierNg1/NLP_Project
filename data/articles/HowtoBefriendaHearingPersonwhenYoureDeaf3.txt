 As your friendship develops, your friend may want to learn to communicate with you more easily. If you speak sign language, you could teach them to sign the alphabet and basic words like “hello” and “thank you.” You could also help them find books and websites that teach sign language., Even if you and your friend are both busy, do your best to prioritize face-to-face time. Meet up for lunch every couple of weeks, or set aside a weekend afternoon to go to a movie together. You don’t have to do anything elaborate – just doing ordinary things together helps to keep a friendship strong.Online tools like Facebook and Snapchat can also help you stay connected to your friend, but they can’t replace spending time together in person.
Consider scheduling regular meetups with your friend. For instance, you could go to the gym together or join the same book club.
 Be sensitive to your friend’s feelings, and provide support and encouragement when they need it. If your friend is especially busy or stressed out, offer to lend a hand with errands or chores., Try to touch base with your friend at least once every two weeks, even if that just means sending them an email or text to say hello. If you fall out of contact, it will be harder to revive the friendship later.

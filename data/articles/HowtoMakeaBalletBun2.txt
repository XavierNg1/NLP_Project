 This can make the hair a bit easier to manage, and keep loose strands from flying off. Use water and a comb to really straighten out your hair, combing out any bumps or fly-away hairs causing problems. If you have thicker or unruly hair, a little gel may be helpful, too.
 If you've recently washed your hair, and everything is silky smooth, you might try a texturizing spray to give the strands some hold. Like most up-dos, this look is a bit easier to pull off with "day old" hair. But, if you're fresh and clean, some texturizer should do the trick.
 With one hand around your tight coil of hair, use the other hand to keep to press and hold the bun around your ponytail as you wrap it. The curl between your thumb and first finger, for example, is a great tool to help mold a perfectly rounded bun.
 For girl's with thinner hair, or for a more "classic" look, you just twist the entire ponytail. But for girls with thick or uneven length hair, or for a slightly more secure hold, you can go with the "two-part" method. Simply pull the ponytail in half, then twist and wrap both halves around the base of the ponytail for a "figure eight" bun.








If you're doing the bun in two parts, simply repeat the exact same steps above for both parts. However, when you get to the wrapping and pinning, just make sure the two strands are wrapped in opposite directions (one clockwise, one counter-clockwise)., If you have blonde hair, don't use the gray hair net because then your bun looks purple. If you're a brunette, don't use the blonde hair net because then you have a lighter bun than the rest of your hair.

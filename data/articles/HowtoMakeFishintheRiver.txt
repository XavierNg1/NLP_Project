 Rip the celery into individual stalks from the root.


It's very easy if you use one hand holding the celery and the other tearing a stalk away from the root.;
, Under running water, rinse the celery stalk, making sure that no dirt is present along it.
 Chop off about an inch (2.54 cm) from the bottom (so that no white is shown).
 The size of the pieces is up to you.
, Drop only one or two drops of food coloring onto the cream cheese.
 Use a wooden spoon to incorporate the food coloring into the cream cheese until well blended.
 Use a butter knife to carefully add the cream cheese into the "log" part of the stalks.
 Insert the crackers, standing upright, into the cream cheese. Keep each one of them slightly apart from another.

 To start off tell yourself: "I can and am going to use my mind to manipulate the cold." Believing in yourself is a major step in cryokinesis.



Hold your hands in front of you in a shape so a sphere could form in it. (Do not let your fingers touch!)
Visualize cold energy flowing into you and out of your hands forming a ball.
Push your hands closer and out again to compress it. (You should feel like pushing two magnets together.)
Tell the psi ball to give a chill to someone, then release it and ask them if it worked. (Its ok if it doesn't work the first time, practice makes perfect!)

, However, if you have finally reached this point you can do crazy things such as:and much more! However this requires huge amounts of energy and is far more advanced than a simple psi ball. To perform a masterÂ cryokinetic skill, you must know that you are ready. (With most people it takes at least 1-2 years of training) When you are ready, you shall have the experience to know how much energy you will need and what it will take.


Creating a blizzard
Freezing something to the touch
Withstand extreme temperatures

Alternatively, you could separate a room into winter and spring decorations to represent Punxsutawney Phil's big moment., Your guests don't necessarily have to come dressed up as groundhogs.

You could make traditional Groundhog Day cookies (popularized on the official Punxsutawney website), or you could make a festive cake.Because groundhogs eat vegetation, you could also leave out a veggie tray or fruit bowl.

To complete the woodland theme, make a trail mix for your guests to enjoy.

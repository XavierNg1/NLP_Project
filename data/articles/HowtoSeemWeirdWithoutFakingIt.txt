 If you're looking up how to be weird, you're a faker. This will just bring out the inner weird.;
, If you want to be 'weird', you don't care about being stylish.
 Buy a few total plain skirts that you like. Don't think about how others will see it. Then get a pair of Tripp jeans. (hot topic has cool ones) and buy some wacky shirts. Remember not to second guess anything. Also buy some over the top jewelry.
 Your style isn't all you. Look around the web for shows, songs, and models that you think are cool. And steal stuff from them. You like a chick's hair style go get it. Found a love for classic rock, go buy a poster. Its all up to you.
 Don't be friends with anyone who gives you a once over and doesn't smile or make a funny joke. Because they suck big time. And no one wants to be friends with a girl who likes snobs.
 And color it differently. (platinum blonde and red are cool.) if you can't dye your hair then buy hair extensions from hot topic. And have someone there or your mom show you how to put them in.
 Use as much as needed! And then some.
 Stay clean. You don't want to be weird smelling or pizza face. Buy good face wash, shampoo, and perfume or lotion. It helps people feel more attached to you when you smell good.
 It helps you expand yourself in the real world. And helps you decide what kind of things to wear and stuff to like when your introduced to it.
 Don't try to be mean. And try not to curse. If you already do, then don't do it when you're mad just as a joke or be like yeah whatever.
 Be relaxed being weird doesn't mean randomly yelling or shouting soup. You can be calm and odd too. Add some zen to yourself.

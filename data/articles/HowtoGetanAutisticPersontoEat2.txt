 If food is easy to get, they are more likely to be able to take the initiative to eat. Here are some snacks that take very little effort to grab:


String cheese
Bowls of nuts or chopped fruit
Granola bars
Pudding, applesauce, or yogurt
Trail mix

, Many autistic people experience alexithymia, and have trouble understanding how they feel. Help them label their emotions, and connect physical and behavioral symptoms to feelings. For example:


"Your forehead is all crinkled and you look stressed. Are you hungry, or is it something else?"
"You're holding your stomach. Usually that means you're hungry. Do you want something to eat?"

, It may take them several seconds to consciously evaluate what is going on with their stomach. Use patience while they think, and let them change their answers if their automatic answer is different from how they're actually feeling.


Try asking them to rate their hunger to encourage them to think about it.
 When you notice that your loved one has successfully fed themselves, remark on it. Tell them what a good job they did, and how happy you are for them. They're more likely to do it again if they think it makes you proud.

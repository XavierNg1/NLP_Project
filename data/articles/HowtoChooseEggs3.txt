 Farms selling eggs that have earned the certified organic label are visited annually by an Organic Program Food Inspector, which ensures their quality. Also, certified organic eggs must come from chickens that have been fed organic feed, kept in humane living conditions and kept free from antibiotics or hormones. Many farmers may call their eggs “organic,” but certification is the only way to know for sure.
 These eggs tend to have thicker shells than large eggs and are less likely to become contaminated by bacteria.
 If hens are allowed to nest anywhere they choose, then farmers will have no idea how old the eggs are or with what they have been in contact. Also, nest litter should be kept clean and dry and changed frequently.
 The longer an egg remains in the nest, the more likely the egg will become dirty, broken or lose interior quality.
 The relative humidity in the room should be about 75 percent.
 Recycling a previously used egg carton is not recommended, and it is illegal in many places for farmers to sell eggs in a carton bearing the name of another farm.

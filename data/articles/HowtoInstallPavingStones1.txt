 Call a local utility company to ask about the location of cables and pipes. If there are any present underneath the planned paving stone area, you may need to change your design.;
, Draw a plan of the area and measure it to determine the amount of paving stone supplies you need. For drainage purposes, plan to install the paving stones with a slight slope away from the house, between 1/4" (6mm) per foot (0.3m) and 1/2" (12mm) per foot (0.3 m).Purchase 5 percent more paving stones than you need to allow for cutting, or 10 percent more if your plan includes many curves or irregular shapes., Plan your desired layout before you purchase the stones, so you're sure you'll be able to build a pattern you like. In general, the more "interlocking" there is, the stronger the pattern will be, making the herringbone pattern a good option for vehicle traffic. Mostly, however, this is an aesthetic decision. Choices for layout include:

"Bricklaying": Lay out the paving stones in an offset grid, so the bottom of each paving stone touches two paving stones underneath it. This tends to look better than a simple grid, and may reduce sliding.
Herringbone: Form an arrow shape by placing two rectangular paving stones at right angles to each other. "Nest" more of these arrows in a long diagonal line under each other, and use similar lines of arrows to fill the remaining space.
Even if your basic pattern only involves one shape of paving stone, you could purchase a second, smaller shape to create a border.
 Remove plants, fallen leaves, and other surface cover from the area so you can clearly see the area you'll be working with. If more intensive preparation is required, such as breaking up concrete, make sure you follow safe practices, and consider hiring a professional.
 Stake the corners of the area you want paved, and tie string taut between the strings to mark the border.

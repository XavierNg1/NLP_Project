 For an easy breakfast or meal on-the-go, try adding some frozen fruit to your favorite yogurt or oatmeal. Frozen strawberries or blueberries are a great addition to plain or vanilla greek yogurt. You can also use them to mix flavors.

For example, put some strawberries into banana yogurt or frozen pineapple into mango yogurt. Similarly, throw a little bit of everything into a batch of steel cut or rolled oats while they’re cooking for added flavor.
 Whether it’s waffle, pancake, or muffin, any batter can be improved by adding frozen fruit. Simply put the fruit into the mix once you’ve completed blending it. Or, if you are making pancakes, feel free to place a few blueberries, blackberries, or other frozen fruit into the batter while it’s cooking.

For muffins, try putting some frozen blackberries or bananas into your blueberry muffin batter.
 Make your own flavored water by adding fruit to it. All you need to do is get a large pitcher or container, fill it with water, add a half a cup of fruit, and let it sit for an hour or so. You can also pop a few pieces into your glass if you only want one drink. Similarly, mix frozen fruit into your lemonade or alcoholic beverages.

For example, you can make a sparkling berry mojito with frozen strawberries, blackberries, lime, rum, ginger ale, and mint leaves.

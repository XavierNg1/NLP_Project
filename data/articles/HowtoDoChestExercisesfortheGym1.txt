 This is the perfect warm-up for a chest-oriented workout. Reach as far as you can above your head, and don't forget to breathe evenly.;
, During this exercise you'll be kneeling on an object and stretching downward towards the floor. The main idea is to improve your upper back's fitness (but that, of course, goes in conjunction with the chest).
 Try to form clean angles with your hips and knees, and don't worry if you lose your balance at any point.
 This plank-like pose will both straighten your back and open up your chest.

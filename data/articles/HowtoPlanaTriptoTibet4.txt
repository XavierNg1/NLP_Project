It is also the place in which Tibetan Buddhism was founded. In addition, the views there are spectacular; the monastery is in a valley with sand dunes and infertile mountains around it. Note that it takes 1 hour and 30 minutes to get there from Tsetang, and the location is in Shannan Prefecture., It is a palace that very well represents Tibet, with the complex building being magnificently "red and white", and the setting is against blue sky and mountains that are green and grey.

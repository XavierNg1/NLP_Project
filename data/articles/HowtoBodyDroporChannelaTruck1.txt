 Front seats are usually held in by four bolts on each corner of the runner (the bar at the bottom of the seat that contacts the floor). Once you remove the bolts you can tilt the seat forward or backward, whichever is easiest, and unplug any wiring connected to the seat. Once the seat is loose you can simply lift it out of the vehicle., This can be tricky depending on what kind of vehicle you are working on. You will need a flat head and Philips screwdriver. It is also ideal to invest in a clip puller, a tool designed to remove plastic clips without damage (prices start at around $10.00), and to work carefully so that you do not scratch any of the textured plastic. This texture cannot be repaired.
 Disconnect the pedal assembly from the linkage on the other side of the firewall or underneath the vehicle. This will need to be done for the accelerator, parking brake, regular brakes, and if you drive a standard the clutch pedal will need to be removed as well.
 Once you have the seats and dash out of the way,replacing your carpet should be easy. The carpet should be held in by plastic clips or twist tabs. Remove these fasteners and pull the carpet up away from the floor.

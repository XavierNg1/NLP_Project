 You can also use a cup, mug, or teacup. You will be working in small amounts, so any small container will do.;
, You will need 1 tablespoon of plain yogurt, 1 tablespoon of honey, and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice.
 You want to end up with a smooth, creamy consistency. Make sure that everything is blended in together and that there are no streaks.
 Scoop some of the mask up using your fingers, and spread it onto your face. Use your fingers to spread it over your cheeks, forehead, and jaw. Avoid getting too close to sensitive areas, such as the mouth and eyes.
 The mask may start to run a little bit. If this happens, lay down on your back, or sit in a chair with your head tilted back.
 Lean over a sink and splash your face with warm water. Gently rub your skin to get the mask off. If your face feels a little bit sticky, use some face wash.
 Honey and yogurt are great at moisturizing skin, but those with sensitive skin may find the lemon juice a little drying. If you happen to have sensitive or dry skin, consider applying some moisturizer.


Avoid going out into the sun after wearing this mask. Lemon juice makes your skin extra sensitive to sunlight, and makes it easier for you to get sunburned.
You can use this mask three to four times a week.

 The top bunk can get warm sometimes, especially in the summer. A small fan can help with circulation and improve your comfort. You may want to choose a plug-in fan to save on batteries and cut down on the inconvenience of changing them.


Some fans clip onto surfaces. One of these might be perfect for your bunk, and might help save space, too.
 Because the top bunk is so close to the ceiling, you might not have great reading light. Also, getting out of your bunk to turn on the lights can be a pain. A plug-in reading light that clips onto your bed frame or sits on an accessible shelf can be a big help.Many reading lights have a long battery life. One of these might be most convenient for you, as a battery powered light will be more portable, allowing you to move it around your bed where you need it most.
 Not only will this be comfy, but you can also use the pillows to make a fort. Stack pillows along the sides of your bed and hang a sheet from the top of the pillow walls to create a roof. Add a pillow to the ladder area for a door, and you've got a castle all your own.Pillows can be expensive. Save money while building up your pillow horde by purchasing these from secondhand stores.
 Some trays can clip onto a narrow surface, like the side or rail of your bunk. These can be super useful if you like to have a glass of water at your bedside at night, or if you enjoy a snack in bed.Search for these kinds of shelves at home centers, hardware stores, and furniture stores. If you're having no luck, online might be the best place to find this kind of shelf.

 Going out together provides a fun way to spend time together outside of school, and an added bonus is that you may be seen by classmates. Go to the park and walk, play sports, or play on the playground like you did as kids. Go to museums and learn new things together.Whether or not you can drive and if you have any money to spend will determine the range of dates you can go on together. Going to a fancy dinner can be fun but may not be practical.;
, Working out or playing sports together gives you a new way to be together besides hanging out at home or school. If your school has a fitness center, work out as a couple after school. Play co-ed intramurals or on club sports teams outside of school.Being active together can be as simple as walking or shooting baskets at the park.
When people see that you care about your health and you enjoy exercising together, they will see your cuteness in a new way.
 When you show up to a bonfire or weekly social event, stick together and mingle with the other guests as a couple. Rather than separating to find your own friends, sticking together shows you can still be a couple in a group of people.Visit groups of each person’s friends so that you both still get to talk to who you want to.
It’s okay to split up and get a little alone time, but when you stay together it is easier for people to see how cute you are.
 Hobbies give you a chance to do something fun and bond through that activity. Your communication will improve because talking during an activity is easier than sitting face to face. Telling people you took a dance class together or hiked the local national park will impress them.Do winter sports like skiing, snowboarding or snowmobiling. Take an art class at the community center. Go to a martial arts studio and practice self defense together.
You don’t necessarily have to start a new hobby. Find something that you both like doing and do it together instead of separately.

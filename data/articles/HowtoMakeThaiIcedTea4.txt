 Put 1 tablespoon (2 grams) of loose-leaf black tea into a mug. Pour 1 cup (240 milliliters) of hot, boiling water over it. Let the tea steep for 2 to 3 minutes.


For best results, use filtered water.
Use Thai black tea for the most authentic taste. If you can't get any, ordinary black tea will do.
 Discard the tea leaves when you are done. If you put your tea leaves into a tea strainer, simply lift the strainer out instead.
 Add the sugar first, then give the tea a good stir until everything is dissolved. Stir in the sweetened condensed milk next. , Make sure that you leave some room in the glass for the evaporated milk!

, If you don't have any evaporated milk, you can also use coconut milk or half-and-half instead.

 Aiming involves Sight Alignment and Sight Placement.;
, Sight Alignment is the centering of the front blade in the rear sight notch, and the raising or lowering the top of the front sight so it is level with the top of the rear sight.
, A Correct Sight Picture consists of correct Sight Alignment, with the front sight placed center mass of the target.


Sight Alignment is the more important of the two, because if the Sight Alignment is correct, then even if the sight picture is partly off center, the target will be hit.
Here is that same picture showing the sights without highlighting.
And here is that same picture indicating the likely combat condition of bad light, or where the sights and target are black, or hard to distinguish from one another.

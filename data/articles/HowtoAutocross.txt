 You can usually do this by contacting a local car club or racetrack and asking for information. Registration fees are often small, usually around fifty dollars.;
, At the same time, you must get your car "teched". This only means it must be examined by the an attending technician. This is an overall, visual inspection, and it checks for basic integrity of vehicle parts. As long as your vehicle is generally well maintained and there is no significant structural issues, this inspection should not be a problem.
 There is no set layout for an autocross course, however, they are often tight and very curvy, to downplay the advantages of horsepower and speed and emphasize the advantages of experienced technical driving. Walk the course over and over. The best autocrossers learn the course so well, they actually memorize the whole course and every turn.
 For example, if you drive a powerful, front engine rear wheel drive (FR) car, the car may have a natural tendency to oversteer. Controlled oversteer can help you set faster times, but it can also be very difficult to control. If you drive a front wheel drive front engine (FF) car, it probably exhibits the natural tendency to understeer. While safer, and less scary, than oversteer, understeer can often slow your times rough curves. If you drive an all wheel drive car, these effects can be mixed and more neutral. There are other layouts, such as rear engine rear wheel drive (RR) and mid-engine rear wheel drive, which also have their own unique handling characteristics.
 Keeping that in mind, almost every autocross event allows you to run multiple times. Line up as directed, and complete your first run slowly. You should always run slowly on your first lap. This is to allow your cars tires and brakes to warm, and because the course feels different from behind the wheel.
 Enjoy.

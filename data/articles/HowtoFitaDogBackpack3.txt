 Your dog may initially resist wearing a pack and try to avoid letting you put it on. You risk traumatizing your dog by forcing the pack on the first time your dog sees it - it can cause stress for your dog., Allow your dog to smell and walk around the backpack at first.Wait a few days after introducing it before trying to put the backpack on your dog.
 The first time you successfully get your dog in the pack, donâ€™t add any additional weight. Rather, once the pack is on, reward your dog with treats and go for a fun walk or hike. Your dog will soon associate wearing the pack with treats and fun times together., Once your dog is ready to carry some items in the pack, it is important to remember not to load it down too much. Dogs should never carry more than 25 percent of their body weight in a backpack.Stronger healthier dogs with a high energy level may be able to carry a bit heavier load, and smaller weaker dogs may not be able to carry more than 10 percent of their body weight.
Too much weight in a backpack can lead to curvature of the spine, so always weigh your pack before placing it on your dog., You want to be sure that one side of the pack is not heavier than another. Make sure the weight is evenly distributed on each side so that your dog does not lose its balance., Your dog will need to build its muscles to handle the extra weight in a pack. A 15-minute walk with a weighted pack is equivalent to a 30-minute walk without, for example.So, slowly increase the amount of weight or gear your dog will carry in the pack.

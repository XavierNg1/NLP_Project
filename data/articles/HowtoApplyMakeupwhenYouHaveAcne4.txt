 Look for products with the following in the first seven items on their list of ingredients:


Benzoyl peroxide: kills the bacteria that cause acne, helps remove oil from the skin and removes dead skin cells that can clog pores.
Salicylic acid: helps prevent pores from becoming plugged.
Alpha hydroxy acids: help to remove dead skin cells and reduce inflammation, and stimulate the growth of newer smoother skin. Two types of alpha hydroxy acids that are used in nonprescription acne products are glycolic acid and lactic acid.
Sulfur: helps removes dead skin cells and excess oil. Some products have an unpleasant smell.If you have a mild reaction to the product, switch to something new. Some products can cause dryness, redness, mild stinging or irritation, especially when you first start using them. Be aware of skin changes with new products and try a different product if you donâ€™t react well.
 If home care remedies and over-the-counter products don't work to clear up your acne, see your family doctor. He or she can prescribe stronger medications and discuss the risks and benefits with you.
 Request a referral from your family doctor to see a dermatologist, a doctor who specializes in skin problems.

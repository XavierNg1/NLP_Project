 Once you’re done writing it, make sure that what you wrote really answers the question or prompt and that your answer covered everything you wanted to cover. Rereading is a really useful step and can make a huge difference in the quality of any writing.


A useful trick is to wait a day or two before rereading your essay for the first time. This will help your brain to recognize mistakes because it won’t remember what you intended to write and fill in the blanks.
 As you reread, you will almost certainly find things that you could have explained better or mistakes that you made. Copy edit your paper and look for grammar and spelling mistakes, tense problems, or even sentences which are correct but sound weird. Rewrite as much or as little as you feel is appropriate and don’t be afraid to rewrite again.


One trick to making sure that your text sounds perfect is to read it out loud to yourself. This will make it easier to spot problems and awkward sentences. Try to replace awkward sections with text that mirrors how you actually speak.
 Editing is very important. You can be an excellent editor with a fantastic knowledge of grammar and spelling and still make mistakes. If you give the essay to someone with good editing skills, they can only help you improve it by catching things that you might not. You can give your essay to a parent, a teacher, or a guidance counselor.
 While you shouldn’t wait until the last minute, you should give it a little time before sending it in. This will give you time to think more about the answer and how you feel about what you wrote. If you still like it after waiting for a bit, send it in.

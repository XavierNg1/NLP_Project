If the color doesn’t bleed off when you rub it, you can safely apply the spray to your stain.
 Use enough product to completely saturate the stained area of fabric — be generous!

, Either buy a cheap toothbrush or use an old one that needs to be replaced anyway to gently scrub at the stain to loosen it from the garment.
 You don’t want to spread the stain around, but dab it to pick the nail polish up onto the cotton ball. When one cotton ball becomes covered with nail polish, replace it with a fresh one to prevent transferring the nail polish back onto your garment.
 Hold the stained part of your garment under running water in the sink or bathtub to rinse the fabric of both polish and bug or hair spray.


Repeat the process of spraying with bug/hair spray, scrubbing with toothbrush, and rinsing in warm water until the stain has been completely removed from your garment.
Run the garment through the laundry when you’ve finished.

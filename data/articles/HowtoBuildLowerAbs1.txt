 After a set of 8-10 of these light crunches, your abs should be warmed up for these lower abdominal exercises.


This exercise should work the rectus abdomens or the vertical band of muscles stretching across your stomach from the middle of ribcage to the pelvic region. It includes both upper and lower abdominals and, because it has three horizontal creases, forms the part of the abs called the washboard. While the upper and lower abdominals cannot be worked independently, you can position your body to target one area more than the other.

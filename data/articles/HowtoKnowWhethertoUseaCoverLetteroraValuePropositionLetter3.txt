 If you want to demonstrate your past work, and thus your abilities, while also proving how you can be beneficial to the company, you can create a hybrid of both the cover and proposition letter.


In essence, you would write a cover letter, with the details of a proposition letter included in the bulk of the letter.
 This combination letter can work well if you are currently employed and want to show how you can transfer your current skills to the company that you are applying to.


Build upon your current behavior and achieved goals to reinforce how you can benefit this new company.
 When you can easily describe the benefits you can bring the company in a few words or sentences, consider using a cover letter than resembles a proposition letter.


Consider adding bullet points emphasizing your accomplishments and unique qualifications that can set you apart from the other candidates.
 If you have numerical figures that can demonstrate your abilities, use them. Employers enjoy seeing the results you have gotten for your current company, so that they can hypothesize the results you could get for their own company.

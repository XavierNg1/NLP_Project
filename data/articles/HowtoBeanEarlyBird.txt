, Whether it is at night or in the morning plan ahead. If you are taking a shower in the morning you might want to wake up a little bit earlier.
 Make sure you can hear it still, but make sure you have to get up. The closer to the door (or bathroom) the better.
 Especially if you are taking a shower the night before. Brush your hair and your teeth.
 Do you know where your shoes are? What kind of clothes are you going to wear?

 Something soothing and relaxing will calm you down before sleeping.
 try using a fan. It can drown out the noise. Listening to an iPod with soft music will also help.
 It may really help.
 You might oversleep and wake up way later than expected.

 Look around for an opening in the ground that looks quite deep. If you are looking to find emerald, make sure the cave is in a savannah biome.;
, Bring a stack of torches, food, water bucket, and your choice of pickaxe. Enter the cave and follow the cave downward. Pick up any ores that you may want. Place torches as the area begins to darken to allow you to see and deter hostile mobs.
 Using a stair system or a two block dig down, head to lower ground, where larger caves can be found. Do not dig straight down, as you will surely land in deadly lava.
 Using torches to illuminate the cave, walk around and pick up any ores you need. Look for ways down or ways to larger cave systems.
 Use the natural underground Minecraft openings to your benefit. Look around for all opening and explore. Mining is now a matter of patience and luck!

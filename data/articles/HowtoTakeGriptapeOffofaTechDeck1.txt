, Put it on "high" and wait about five seconds for it to heat up.
 Keep it here for about twenty seconds. This will melt the glue making the grip looser and easier to remove.
 Don't rip it off, just gently peel it back. The slower you do this, and the more care you take, the less griptape and glue will be left behind. If the griptape gets stuck, heat it again for about ten seconds and then try peeling it.

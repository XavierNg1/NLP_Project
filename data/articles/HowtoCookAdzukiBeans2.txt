 Place the adzuki beans in a medium to large saucepan or bowl and fill the container with enough water to cover the beans. Let the beans soak overnight at room temperature.


Strictly speaking, it is not essential to soak adzuki beans. You can cook them in a pressure cooker without pre-soaking them, but pre-soaking will reduce the cooking time and can also help strip away any water-soluble components responsible for digestive upset.
If you want the beans to keep their color, shape, and aroma, do not soak them before cooking them.
 Pour the beans and water through a colander to drain them. Rinse the beans under running water several times.


Rinsing the beans after draining them will remove more of the water-soluble fibers still clinging to the outer skin of the beans.
 Transfer the drained beans to a pressure cooker and add 2 cups (500 ml) of cool water. Cover the pressure cooker and set it to cook on high pressure.
 If you soaked the beans, this should only take 5 to 9 minutes. If you did not soak the beans, this can take 15 to 20 minutes.Drain any excess water when done by pouring the contents of the pressure cooker through a colander again. Note that there should not be much water left after the beans finish cooking, though.
When ready, the beans should be tender enough to pierce with a fork.
 Serve the adzuki beans alone while still hot or add them to your favorite bean dish recipe.


If serving the beans warm, you can serve them with tortilla shells, cornbread, or rice. You can also add them to casseroles, bakes, chili, and stew.
If you decide to let them cool, you can enjoy the beans mixed into a green mixed salad.
If you have leftovers, you can store the cooked adzuki beans in an airtight container for five days in the refrigerator or six months in the freezer.

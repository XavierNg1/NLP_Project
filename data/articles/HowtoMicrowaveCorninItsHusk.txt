 Make sure it's still in the husk and all the kernels are still intact. If any are loose and you can see them through the husk, pull the husk over a little to cover it up, or you may want to pull that kernel out, so it doesn't burn.;
, If your microwave is higher or lower than regular ones, check it every few minutes. Apart from that, put your feet up and let the microwave do the work!

, Be sure to wear oven mitts while doing this, because the husk is a good heat conductor and stores heat like sponge stores water!

, Make sure you cut the bottom and if you have anything hanging out, like a stringed piece of husk or a kernel, pull/cut it off. Make sure you have a perfect cut, and don't remove too much of the actual sweet corn!

, You don't need to pull each individual piece of husk off, just place your thumb and index finger at the top, making sure you're close to a tabletop, and a tea towel is underneath, to prevent the corn from being crushed, bruised or juiced, and squeeze lightly, and working your index finger and thumb down along with the corn. Don't force it, though. Make sure it comes out of the end you cut!

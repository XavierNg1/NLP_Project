 Depending on the dish and your own preferences, you can improve on the flavor of naan beyond the plain version. Here are some suggested flavoring changes:Peppered naan bread: Brush the rolled-out naan dough with butter, oil or ghee and sprinkle with plenty of freshly ground coarse black pepper.
Spicy naan: Add 1 teaspoon of ground coriander and 1 teaspoon of ground cumin to the flour in the step adding flour. Mix well. For a very spicy naan, also add 1/2 teaspoon of hot chili powder.
Onion naan: Add 1/2 cup very finely chopped or grated onion to the dough before kneading. Mix in well. This can make the dough soggy, so either press liquid from the onion or reduce the amount of egg added.
Wholemeal naan: Substitute wholemeal bread flour for the standard bread flour.

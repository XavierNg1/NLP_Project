 It's considered inhumane to kill sand dollars for the express purpose of drying them out and using them as decoration. If everyone did this, the population could suffer dramatically, and eventually no one would be able to collect sand dollar shells at all.


Don't collect sand dollars straight from the ocean. Sand dollars, which are related to starfish and sea urchins, burrow beneath the sand of the seafloor to protect themselves from predators and debris. If you dig up a sand dollar underwater, there's a good chance that it's alive.
Turn the sand dollar over and look for tiny, centipede-like feet or hairs on its bottom side. Gently brush the feet with your finger. If they move, the sand dollar is alive, and you should gently place it back into the water. If not, then feel free to take the sand dollar home.
If a sand dollar is moist or solid in your hand, there's a good chance that it's alive or recently deceased, even if you found it washed up on the beach. Exercise your best judgement, and consider returning a sand dollar to the sea if you aren't sure.;
, The relative rarity of washed-up sand dollars can make their discovery even more meaningful--and you will know that you aren't capturing and killing a live animal.


In many states, it's illegal to collect living sand dollars, and you may face a fine if you're caught in the act.If you're not sure about the law--or if you care about preserving fragile littoral ecosystems--don't take sand dollars directly from the ocean.
Many beaches and coastal authorities restrict the number of sand dollars that you can harvest in one go. Research local beach-combing rules and restrictions before you set out for the day.

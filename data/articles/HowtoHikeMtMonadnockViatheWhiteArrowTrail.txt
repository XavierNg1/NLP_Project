, One option is to walk up the wide, gravel Old Tollhouse Road pictured here. Another option is to take the Halfway House Trail. Both routes are of approximately equal distance, over parallel areas, but the trail offers a more "wilderness feel" and is the more recommended route.
 You will pass a variety of deciduous trees and will see beautiful foliage if you do the hike in October.
 While the house is no longer there, the historical marker will remind you that you are about halfway in distance to the summit. That said, at this point the trail becomes much steeper and the real work is still ahead of you.
 At times it will be a staircase like series of rocks. As you climb, the trees will change from deciduous trees to evergreens till the point you eventually pass the timberline.
 The evergreen trees will give way to series of bushes and allow a view of the summit. While the summit looks tantalizingly close at this point, some relatively slow climbing over steep rock remains ahead.


At this point the trail becomes a bit less obvious and it helps to follow the white paint trail markings found on the rocks every 30 feet (9.1Â m) or so.
 Enjoy the fantastic view.

 Start by boiling 3 cups (710 ml) of water in a kettle or in a pot over the stove. Bring the water to boiling temperature (212 degrees Fahrenheit, 100 degrees Celsius)., Do this slowly and carefully, making sure not to spill any of the water on you. Pour all of the water down the drain to flush it out.
 Once you have poured the hot water down the drain, let it work through the drain for five minutes. Then, pour 3 cups (710 ml) of cold water down the drain to help congeal and remove any remaining debris or grease in the drain.
 Do a final flush of the drain with 3 cups (710 ml) of boiling hot water. This should remove any remaining grime or debris in the drain.You can flush the drain with hot water on a weekly basis to keep it clean.

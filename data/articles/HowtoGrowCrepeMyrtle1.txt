, Crepe myrtle needs full sun to thrive, so the location you choose should receive six to eight hours of direct sunlight per day on average.
 These trees grow best in loose, well-drained soil. Clear a spot that is about 3 feet by 3 feet (1 yard by 1 yard). Loosen the soil in that spot by chopping it up with a rake or shovel.
 If you have heavy soil, you may need to mix a little peat moss or garden sand into the soil to improve its drainage properties. You can also mix in compost or a slow-release fertilizer, but if you do, you should make sure to mix the additive thoroughly to the entire plant bed. Uneven pockets of nutrients in the soil can cause the roots to develop poorly.
 Crepe myrtle thrive in soil that is neutral to slightly acidic, about 6.0 to 7.3. If you need to decrease the pH, mix in additional organic matter like compost or manure. If you need to increase the pH, mix in agricultural lime.
 The hole should be twice as wide as the root ball, but it should be about the same depth as the nursery pot holding the plant. Avoid planting the root ball any deeper than that since the soil around the root ball needs to stay oxygenated. For best results, the root ball should be about level with the soil.
 Lightly pack the soil around the base of the tree. The soil should be heavy and packed enough to help hold the young tree in place, but it should still be fairly loose to allow the roots room to grow.

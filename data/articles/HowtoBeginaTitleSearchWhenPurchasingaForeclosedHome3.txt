 If you have purchased a home before and had a good experience with a title search company, your best course of action would be to call them again.
 Most likely, if you have contacted an attorney for help on this particular purchase, they will perform the title search themselves (or a paralegal in their office). Alternatively, the attorney is likely to have some good referrals for you, for reasonably priced, and experienced title search companies that you could call.
 In a foreclosure, the bank that holds the mortgage is interested in getting the property sold and making their money back. Their primary objective is to get back the amount of their mortgage. They may or may not represent any lower-position mortgages that are recorded against the property.But if you can get in touch with a representative of the bank, they may be willing to share with you whatever information they have about liens against the property. They may also be able to refer you to a reliable title search agency.

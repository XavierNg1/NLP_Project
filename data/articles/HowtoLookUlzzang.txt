 ~ The desired (but not absolutely necessary) key features among Ulzzangs are pale, flawless skin, big eyes, and a small, round face, somewhat reminiscent of anime characters. This, of course, is not how most Ulzzangs look naturally, because many use large amounts of makeup and sometimes Photoshop, but if you can achieve this look only using makeup and not Photoshop, thus getting a more natural look, that's great. (Ulzzangs in general doesn't look very natural but you can at least try!);
, and even out skin tone. You may need primer/specialized lotion/pore refining cream or concealer if you have spotty skin, large pores, or dark circles/eye bags. Apply setting powder to keep the makeup on. If you like, add a hint of pink/apricot shimmer (blush) to the cheeks for a little glow, but don't use much. Ulzzangs also like to have a small, kind of pointy nose, so if your nose isn't small or a "button nose," you can contour it, but be careful to make it look as natural as possible.
 White eyeliner, black eyeliner, mascara/fake lashes and circle lenses (lenses that enlarge the iris, which makes the eyes look bigger and rounder) are used by most Ulzzangs. Also, since the style is from Korea, many people think that you have to have the Asian eye shape for this. It may make some people think you look more Ulzzang, but it is not absolutely crucial.
 Maybe some lipgloss if you like, but keep it looking simple, light, and bright.
 The hair is very different among Ulzzangs, and there is no specific hairstyle you must have. Just make sure it looks neat, clean and natural. Hair colour isn't crucial either. Popular styles include long hair (curled or straightened) with bangs (square or sideswept). Try to mix it up with hair ties and accessories, or even wigs if you desire a new colour or hair length.

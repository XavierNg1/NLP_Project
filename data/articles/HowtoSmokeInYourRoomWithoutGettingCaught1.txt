 A sploof is a tube capped with a dryer sheet that will turn the smell of your smoke into the smell of fresh laundry. The first step in building your sploof will require you to gather the necessary materials. Collect the following items to build your sploof:Find a cardboard tube or PVC tube. A cardboard tube from a toilet paper roll works fine.
Dryer sheets will be used to absorb and cover up the smell of the smoke.
Grab something to attach the dryer sheets or a sock to the end of the tube. Rubber bands will work great for this.
Some recommend adding activated carbon to your sploof. This can be found at pet stores.;
, After you have gathered the materials needed to build your sploof it's time to assemble it. Building your sploof in a certain way will allow you to exhale the smoke through it and cover up the smell of the smoke. Follow these simple steps to build your sploof.Grab about three dryer sheets and cover one end of the cardboard tube with them.
Secure the dryer sheets in place by putting a rubber band around them.
Fill the length of the tube with the rest of the dryer sheets you have.
You can also add the activated carbon to your tube at this point.
 Now that your sploof has been created it's time to put it to use. Whenever you want to smoke exhale through the sploof. Whatever smoke passes through the dryer sheets will come out smelling fresh, covering up the smell of your smoking.Always exhale through the sploof, pushing the smoke through the dryer sheets.
Change your dryer sheets if you notice their scent fading.
It's likely that some smoke will not pass through the sploof so take care to cover up the smoke in other ways as well.

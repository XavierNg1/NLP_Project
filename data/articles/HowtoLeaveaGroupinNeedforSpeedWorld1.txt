After logging in, NFSW will initiate an update. As soon as NFSW has finished downloading and installing all the required updates from the Internet, a dialog box with a “Play” button will appear.
 Click on the “Play” button, and press “Enter” or any other key to start. This will load and display your NFSW profile details.


Click “Enter World” to enter the NFS World in Free Roam mode.
Free Roam is a mode in the game (and most other modern NFS titles) that allows you to tour the racing world to find races or other drivers.
 This will launch NFS World’s Social screen.
 It is the third icon from the left at the top of the screen; if you hover your mouse over the icon, it will say “Group List.” This will open the Group tab, which lists all the members in the group.
 Click the “Leave Group” button at the bottom of the screen. This is the button next to the “+” icon.


Click “Yes” on the dialog box that appears to confirm the action. This will immediately remove you from the group.
 This is optional, but if you really want to check that you’ve been removed from the group, open the Social screen again and access the Group List tab. If you are not in a group, a notification will appear on Group List tab indicating so; otherwise, the other Drivers that are in the group will be listed.

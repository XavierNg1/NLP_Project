, It will be easier for these anti-adware programs to scan when your computer is running in Safe Mode.


Reboot your computer.
Repeatedly hit F8 before the Windows logo appears.
Select "Safe Mode with Networking" from the Advanced Startup menu.

Click here for more detailed instructions on entering Safe Mode.
 Start up AdwCleaner and click the "Search" button. Allow the program to scan your computer (this could take a few minutes).
 When AdwCleaner has finished scanning, it will return a list of results. By default, all of these should be checked already.
 AdwCleaner will eliminate all of the checked entries.
 Both of these operate similarly to AdwCleaner. Allow them to scan your computer, and then clean or quarantine the results of the scan.


Only run one scan at a time.
 Once you have run a scan with all three programs and removed any results, you can reboot your computer to exit Safe Mode and move on to the next section.
 Even if you don't use Internet Explorer, you should still go through these steps, since it is used in some system tasks.
,,, You will be prompted to restart your computer.

 Start AdwareMedic and click "Scan for Adware". AdwareMedic scans are usually fairly quick.
 If AdwareMedic finds any adware files on your computer, it will list them along with the name of the adware program. Any files which AdwareMedic deems dangerous will automatically be marked for deletion.


You may want to check the items that are left unchecked. These are usually browser settings files that have been modified. Removing them will help guarantee that the adware is removed, but will also revert some of your browser settings in the process.
 All of the checked results will be removed and placed in a folder in your Trash.


You may be prompted for the administrator password when removing certain adware.
You may also be prompted to reboot your computer in order to complete the process.
 Sometimes, adware can make changes to the actual Firefox program. This isn't something that can be fixed by AdwareMedic, but it will notify you if it finds evidence. If this happens to you, it is highly recommended that you delete Firefox and redownload it from Mozilla., Safari doesn't have a browser reset option that removes extensions for you, so you'll have to do it all manually.
,, The location varies depending on the version of Safari you are using.


Set the default search engine back to your preferred search engine.
 Look for any unknown extensions and click Uninstall.

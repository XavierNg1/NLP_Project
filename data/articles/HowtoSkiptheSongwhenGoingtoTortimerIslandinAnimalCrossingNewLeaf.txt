 First, you need to initiate your trip to the island. Kapp’n is located at the end of the docks along the south edge of your town. Talk to him by pressing “A.”;
, Kapp’n will ask if you want to go to the island and inform you that the trip costs 1,000 bells round-trip. As long as you have the bells on hand, choose yes in order to start heading to the island.
 Once you’re in the boat, Kapp’n will start to sing his song. Skip the song by pressing “B” repeatedly while he is singing. After pressing “B” enough times, Kapp’n will talk a little bit about how you’re in such a rush, but it will cause you to immediately land at the island and exit into the shop.


If you do nothing, Kapp’n will continue to sing, and you will simply have to wait for him to finish.

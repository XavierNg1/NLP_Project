 The London Eye has an important list of restricted items. Many of these will be taken from you at a security check before entry, and returned to you once you disembark. This list includes, but is not limited to:

Sharp objects, from knives to nail files.
Replica or toy guns.
Large bags or rucksacks.
Skateboards and rollerblades., It can take at least 45 minutes to board the London Eye, with wait times increasing during peak times, especially on weekends and holidays.

It’s suggested that you arrive at least 30 minutes before your booked time; this will allow you sufficient time to collect your tickets and join the queue.
If you have a standard entry, you’ll enter the capsule through the standard queue. The Fast Track queue can only be accessed if you have a Fast Track ticket and allows for shorter queue times., The London Eye capsules offer a full 360 degree view, and it moves slowly enough to guarantee a you’ll catch all of London’s sights. While the capsule can hold up to 28 people, you should still be able to move around and get a good view. The ride takes about 30 minutes, so make sure to keep your eyes open.

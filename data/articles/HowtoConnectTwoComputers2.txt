 At least one of the computers being connected should be using Windows Vista, 7, or 8.
 If you're connecting a Windows 7 and Windows Vista computer together, use Windows 7 to perform these tasks.


Click the Start button, and then click Control Panel. In the search box, type "network," and then click on Network and Sharing Center.
 In the network map, shown at the top of the Network and Sharing Center, double click on the Unidentified network icon.


If you have more than a single network, the icon will be named Multiple networks.
 If network discovery and file sharing are turned off, in Network, click the info bar containing this message: Network discovery and file sharing are turned off. Network computers and devices are not visible. Click to change..., and then click Turn on network discovery and file sharing. If you're asked for an admin password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation, as required.


Note: if one of the computers is running Windows XP, it may take a while for it to appear in the Network window. You may need to configure the XP computer as described below.

Craigslist or eBay is a good place to start selling your games, as you have control over the price. Keep your old Nintendo DS cartridges, as the 3DS can play those.
Trading in your games may not be a good idea, since you get a really low price for your games.;
, Do some chores, or wait until your birthday, Christmas, or any other gift-giving events (ex. Chinese New Year).

. If you are a teenager, you could get a job to help raise money for it., Some stores may drop the price by $20 or so on a sale.

. If Nintendo chooses to release a new handheld in the future, you can also choose to buy it at a lower price.

If you look around, there will be some great deals. Checking your local Craigslist under "Video Games" is a good idea.
Ask your friends. If they have a 3DS but bought a 3DS XL or simply don't want it anymore, you could ask them if they can sell you their old 3DS.

If you got an iPhone, download the Red Laser app, and scan the 3DS's barcode, to bring up a list of deals and offers.

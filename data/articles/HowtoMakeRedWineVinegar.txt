Fill an earthenware crock full of water to test for leaks. Then drain the crock. Do this prior to making each batch of red wine vinegar to be sure that the spigot isn't leaking or cracks haven't developed. Drain the water.;

Add 2 cups (240 ml) of a good quality red wine and 1 cup (120 ml) of water that has been filtered, to the crock and add a "mother." The mother is a live starter that allows the chemical reaction of turning wine into vinegar to take place.



Fold cheesecloth into thirds and cover the crock with the cloth. Tightly secure it to the lid of the crock with elastic bands. Set the crock in a warm dark corner of the kitchen and let it stand undisturbed for 10 days.



On the 11th day add 2 1/2 cups (360 ml) of red wine. On the 16th day add another 2 1/2 cups (360 ml) of red wine and on the 21st day add a final 2 1/2 cups (360 ml) of red wine to the crock. The crock should be about 2/3 full. If a thin layer has formed over the surface of the wine, add the wine through a turkey baster that you insert between the thin layer and the side of the crock. Try not to disturb the thin layer.



Once the final portion of red wine has been added to the crock, leave it covered and undisturbed for 10 weeks.



If the vinegar smells tart and vinegary after the culmination of 10 weeks, then it is ready to bottle. Strain the vinegar through a coffee filter into sterilized bottles. The vinegar will keep for 4 months.



If you plan on storing the vinegar for longer than 4 months then you need to pasteurize it first. Pour the vinegar into a stainless steel pot and heat it to 155 degrees F (68 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Allow it to cool and bottle as before.

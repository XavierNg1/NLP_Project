 From the pantry cabinet to the dinner plate or drink glass shelf, identify a cabinet door that is often used.


Consider the amount of space you will need. Do you simply want an area to write down phone messages or do you need more room so you can post everyone’s schedule or calendar?;
, If you’d like to include a pouch or box area to hold paperwork or pens, take into consideration the depth you have between the door and the inner shelving. If a pocket is must and space is tight you may need to consider another area.


Plan how much material you’ll need for the entire board, especially if you plan to create something with two (or three) different types of material. For example, if you are doing a dry erase and cork board, measure the amount of space you’ll need for the dry erase portion as compared to the cork portion.






Pencil sketch the board on the back of the cabinet so you can see how it will look. This will give you a better idea if you should make one area of the board bigger than the other (perhaps you’ll need more room for the dry erase as compared to the cork).
 The way you plan to use the message board will dictate the type of material you’ll need. For simple message posting, cork or metal might work (for magnets and or thumbtacks) or if you think you may need to create pockets to hold piece of information you may want to consider creating a board that has wooden or canvas pouches to hold items.

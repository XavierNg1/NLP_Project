 You have a personal bank that you can use to store items. This offers space for 60 items, and can be upgraded just like your regular storage space. However, after joining a guild, you will also get access to the guild’s storage bank, which offers 500 inventory spaces!


Warning: keep in mind that all guild members can use the guild storage bank, so you will not get to use all the inventory spaces provided, or you may discover that some of your items disappear.
 After all, that’s why you joined the guild! Making friends in the guild will also have a direct impact on your inventory space. However, first get to know players in the guild, and make some friends that you get to trust in the game. You’ll be able to use the mail system to its full value once you do, and decrease the number of items stored in your inventory.
 You can send mails to other players in the game, and the mails are saved for 30 days, along with the items attached. This means that you can use mails to empty most of your inventory while you’re out questing. Simply mail items you don’t need at the time to a friend, and then ask him to send it back when you’re in town or when you need them. Warning: only do this with friends or persons you know well! There’s no way of forcing them to give the items back, so you don’t want to send items to someone who may not want to send them back.

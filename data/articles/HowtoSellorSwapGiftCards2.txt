 If you’d prefer to swap the gift cards among people you know, you can arrange a gift card swap. This could be an informal gathering at your home where you invite friends and family over to swap gift cards they no longer want or have not yet used. Have everyone write down the dollar amount of their gift cards and swap amongst themselves.


Another option is to set up the gift card swap like an auction, where people bid on different gift cards or offer to swap their gift cards for someone else’s gift cards.
You can have people offer several gift cards for the price of one card as part of the swapping rules. This may be important if the gift card someone wants is to a more desirable place than the cards they have and want to swap up.
 You can also work as your own private seller and speak to family or friends about selling your gift cards to them. Create a list of gift cards you are selling and circulate the list to family or friends via email. Or visit family and friends to try to sell gift cards you think they might want.


For example, perhaps you have a friend who loves to online shop on Amazon. You can then try to sell any Amazon gift cards you may have to them.
 When you sell the gift cards on your own, you will need to determine how much you want to charge for them. Perhaps you give buyers a discounted rate as an incentive to buy them from you, such as 10% off the amount on the card as the selling price. Or maybe you offer buyers a deal if they buy more than one gift card from you.


If you received the gift cards for free as a gift, you can offer to charge buyers the amount on the gift card as the selling price. This way, you do not lose out on any money and still get cash for the gift card.

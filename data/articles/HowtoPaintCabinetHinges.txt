Many nice vintage, even antique and ornate hinges have been found under layers of paint.
 Once the hinges have been cleaned, rub them with a medium-grit sandpaper to prepare them for the paint. This is termed "priming" and will ensure that old paint, grime build-up and rough surfaces are removed. Wipe with a tack cloth after sanding to clean off the sanding dust.
 Decide on the color––do you want to use a metallic paint that mimics the original metal or do you want to paint the hinge the same color as the cabinet or a complementary one?


Do not use latex paint as it will affect the movement of the hinge.
Spray paint is easier and faster than using a paintbrush and paint, but the choice is up to you.
Get some clear metal primer. Placing this on the hinges first will help ensure that the paint stays intact.
 Line a work surface with newspaper or another cover.
 Paint at least two layers to ensure an even coating. If spraying, keep moving the spray nozzle to ensure that it does not layer too thickly in any one spot.


Allow to fully dry between layers.
If the hinges have evident nails, paint the nail ends as well, to ensure a whole look.

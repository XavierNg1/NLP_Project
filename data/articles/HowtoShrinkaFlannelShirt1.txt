 Before trying to shrink your shirt, double check to make sure it can be washed. Make sure the flannel is made from either wool or cotton.You’ll have more luck shrinking loose natural fibers, like wool or cotton. Synthetic fibers will be more difficult to shrink.
If the care label says the garment is pre-washed, you might have to take it down a size instead of shrinking it by washing and drying.;
, Fill the largest pot you have on hand with water. Add a cup of vinegar, and bring it to a rolling boil.Adding vinegar will help retain your shirt’s color by minimizing the amount of dye that bleeds out from the heat.
 When the water and vinegar begins to vigorously boil, remove the pot from heat. Place your shirt into the pot, and use a wooden spoon to soak and agitate it. Keep the shirt in the pot for five minutes.Be careful not to burn yourself.
 If you can pick up the heavy pot of water, drain the water carefully into the sink. When the shirt is cool enough to touch, pick it up and put it in the dryer for 45 to 60 minutes on a medium setting.If the pot is too heavy for you to pick up, just let the water cool until it’s safe to lift the shirt. Use the spoon to help get the shirt of out the water.

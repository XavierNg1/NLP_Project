 Art is very personal and it is not always meant to make you feel good. As a result, you may offend people by giving harsh criticism. Instead, you can comment on the art itself, without saying whether or not you like it. This allows you to comment on the work without giving your personal feelings.Avoid saying things like "I could make that." This type of comment is insulting to the artist and does not promote artistic conversation.
If you do dislike a piece, you can explain that it's due to your personal taste. For instance, you can say, "I can see this is well composed. I have trouble looking at this image, though, because it's so dynamic it almost feels violent.‚Äù

, A great way to assess a piece of art is by asking questions. If you're going to talk about art, questions are a great way to learn from your companions and promote conversation.Ask if your companion knows much about the artist or the art movement in question.
Get the opinion of your companion about a piece.
 If you are visiting an art gallery with a group of friends or colleagues and you do not know much about the kind of art you're viewing, feel free to admit to confusion at any point. Some people in your group may actually be relieved to discover that they are not the only person outside of their comfort zone.Pretending to know a lot will be awkward, and isn't necessary.
You might say, "Wow, I can tell a lot is going on here, but I don't know where to start."

, The most important thing when you are thinking and talking about art is that it makes you feel something, even if that feeling is unpleasant. Comment on how the piece makes you feel and why. Sometimes the artist will intentionally want the audience to feel uncomfortable. This does not mean you need to judge the quality of work, just the impression that the piece has left on you.For example, you may feel inspired, sad, happy, confused, uncomfortable, angry, etc.

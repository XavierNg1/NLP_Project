 This technique involves using a door, mirror, or anything else as a gateway to a different location, planet, or universe.Concentrate on the place you want to reach. Your dream is technically a land in your imagination, so imagine it as well as you can. Then simply open the door or walk through the mirror.
If you don't find yourself in the right place, try again or just explore where you are. The place you wanted might be right around the corner.
 Imagine in as much detail as possible, the place you want to go. Then, will your surroundings to blur and fade, and your new location to fill in the blanks.


You can also try spinning in place, knowing that when you stop, you will be in your desired location.
 Close your eyes and decide that when you open them you will be in the right place (be wary of closing your eyes all the way because sometimes the dream will fade away and you will wake up).


If you can't teleport without a gateway, don't worry. It takes more time and practice without a gateway but you'll get it in time.

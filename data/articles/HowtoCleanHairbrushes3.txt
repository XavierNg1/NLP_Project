 If you have an expensive hairbrush made of wood, you don't want to completely soak it in water, or the wood could warp. Use a small amount of water as you scrub the brush, then wet a towel with water and wipe off the soap instead of running it under water.









If your hairbrush is wooden, don't take it in the shower with you.
If you do end up getting the brush wet with water, try to dry it off right away.
 You can clean the brush by wiping it off with a damp towel, then conditioning it with a few drops of tea tree oil, which is a natural antiseptic. Rub the drops of oil into the wooden part of the brush, then set it on a towel to dry before you use it.

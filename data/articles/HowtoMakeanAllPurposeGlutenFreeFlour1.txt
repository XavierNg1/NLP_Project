 Brown rice flour is a whole-grain flour, which is less processed than other types of flour.


You can find rice flour in the baking aisle of most health food stores or large supermarkets. If you are looking to save money, opt for white rice flour. You can find it for a low price at ethnic grocery stores.;
, Do not use potato flour. Potato starch thickens and adds moisture to baked goods.


You can substitute the potato starch with corn starch. The potato starch handles higher temperatures, so it is better for making baked goods, roux and breading. If you do substitute corn starch, you will need to add 1/3 cup (64 g) more of corn starch because it is lighter than the potato starch.
 This is also useful as a thickener in the recipe.
 This is a binding agent that is commonly used in gluten-free baking. You will not need to add the xanthan or guar gum to recipes, if it is in your all-purpose flour.
 Pour it into a sifter to mix it more fully and break up clumps. This gluten-free flour mixture makes a very large batch. It can be made using the same ratios of 6 to 2 to 1, but in smaller amounts, with just a dash of xanthan gum.
 The ingredients can settle, creating pockets of 1 ingredient or another.
 If you think you have made more than you think you can use, store the extra in a sealed container in the fridge. Bring it to room temperature before using.

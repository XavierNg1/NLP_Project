 Before deciding on a course of treatment, the vet needs to diagnose the precise type of cancer and how far advanced it is. This is so you can make an informed decision about what is in your dog's best interest.For example, if your dog had a bone cancer affecting a leg but the cancer has already spread to the liver and lungs, then it would be unfair to put the dog through major surgery to amputate the affected leg.
On the other hand, if it's proven the cancer is localized to that one limb, then surgery becomes a good option to prevent spread and alleviate the pain.;
, This will cost you more but it is important. The vet needs to run a number of tests to reach a diagnosis and assess how advanced the cancer is. This involves biopsying the cancer and imaging, such as chest radiographs, abdominal ultrasounds, or an MRI or CT scan.This gives a visual picture of if there are any suspicious lumps that need to be further biopsied to see if they are cancerous.
 Different cancers respond to different therapies, so once your vet has assessed the cancer fully, they can decide which option is going to be most effective. The options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, cryosurgery, or heat therapy.


Some of these procedures require special safety equipment or specialist knowledge, and so referral to a veterinary oncologist may be necessary.

 Accept the fact that you are improving and there will always be a learning curve. Stop beating yourself up over your idea of failure so much that you ignore the learning process. Give yourself the time to learn the game and recognize the growth process.Make trial and error a fun part of learning instead of something you dread. If you approach it more like a science experiment, it becomes fun to try something to see what happens. You may find some of your biggest discoveries start out as a failure.
 There are several sites including YouTube that are great resources for tips and hacks. Online communities are also a great way to see other people like yourself who are out there struggling and beating the very same game you are struggling with. It can be done and you will figure it out., If you normally would blow up or get really angry at the thought of not winning, even the fact that you are able to control that impulse is a win.


Tracking your performance in a journal can help you to see the progress and may even show you patterns that you need to beat the game. Write down each trial and error, you never know which move will be the winning one.
 The only sure fire way you will lose the game is to give up. Instead of focusing on “never” winning a certain level, learn to tell yourself you haven’t won the level “yet”. Simply changing your view of the challenge and future success will change the way you look at the progress you have made.

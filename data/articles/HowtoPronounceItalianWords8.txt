 In contrast to elisione in certain places Italians add a letter 'd' to make music of the speech easier. They are also used in writing.
 This, normally, is used when the beginning letter of the next word is a similar vowel or when it is more convenient keeping the flow of speech. They are used in these places


Italian "e" meaning "and" becomes "ed"

Italian "o" meaning "or" becomes "ed"
Italian "a" meaning "at, to" becomes "ad"

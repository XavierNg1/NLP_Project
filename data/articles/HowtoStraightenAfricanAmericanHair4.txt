 Hair relaxers work by treating your hair with an alkaline agent that breaks down the hair follicle to straighten it. This treatment is effective and permanent. The downside is that it can also be pricey, and the chemicals can cause long-term damage to your hair and even your skin.


Do research to make sure you go to a good salon to get your hair relaxed. Strong chemicals in the wrong hands can wreak havoc on your hair.
Don't get a straightening treatment done on freshly washed hair. Go several days without washing first so your hair has some natural protection from the chemicals.
You can also get a texturizing treatment, which is similar to a relaxing treatment but with less severe chemicals and a softer, wavier effect.
 Keratin treatments last about 6 weeks, after which they wash out. They leave the hair looking straight and sleek, but some treatments contain formaldehyde. If you're worried about using chemicals on your hair and skin, skip this one.
 In recent years this technique has become more popular. It's a sulfer-based treatment that is said to be less harsh on the hair, with permanent effects. If you're interested in this treatment, be sure to go to an experienced beautician.

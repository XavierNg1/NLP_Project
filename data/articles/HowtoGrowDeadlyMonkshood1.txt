 The spot should also be exposed to four to six hours of direct sunlight each day.


Monkshood will grow in a sunny area with six to eight hours of direct sunlight but thrives in partial shade.;
, Monkshood is not especially particular about what type of soil it grows in as long as it drains quickly. Prior to planting the monkshood, spread a 3- to 6-inch depth of organic matter like well-aged cow manure, compost, composted shredded bark mulch and leaf mold over the soil.Mix the organic matter into the soil thoroughly to a depth of 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm).
 Plant the seeds 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) deep and 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart.Keep the soil moist but not soggy. Monkshood seedlings do not like to have soggy feet.
 Thin the seedlings to 1 or 1 ½ feet apart. It can take up to three years for the plants to bloom when they are grown from seed.
 They usually will not bloom the first year after being transplanted into the garden. Plant them 1 to 1 ½ feet apart.

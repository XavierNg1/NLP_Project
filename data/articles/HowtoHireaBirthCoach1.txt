 Hiring a birth coach can be an expensive process and some birth coaches can charge up to a couple thousand dollars for their services. It will be easier to narrow down the list of potential providers if you know exactly how much you have set aside to spend on their services and stay within that budget.;
, The amount of money that birthing coaches charge can vary greatly and can depend on a lot of factors, such as the coaches popularity among pregnant women in the area and the level of experience. Negotiation is always encouraged and some birthing coaches will work with you.


Check to see if the birth coach offers a sliding fee scale. This is a fee that you will determine together with your birthing coach based on your current income. This can be a very helpful option and is definitely worth inquiring about.
 Sometimes you can find a birth coach who is finishing up a training program and is serving under an experienced birth coach to learn the trade. This can help you save a lot of money and will also give the coach-in-training some real labor experience.


This may seem like a scary option at first because you will be entrusting your emotional and physical well-being during your pregnancy, labor and birth to someone who has little to no active experience. However, you should keep in mind that the coach who is in training will be accompanied by the licensed birth coach during the labor and delivery process, so there will always be someone there who has the experience needed to help you through the process.

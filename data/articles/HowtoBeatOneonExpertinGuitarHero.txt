 This is considered the 4th hardest song in the game and you won't beat it the first time trying!;
, You should be able to hit as good as everything before the fast strum. If not, there is a good chance you aren't good enough to beat it yet.
 this will help later on in the song during the solo.
 The more the better, and a full bar might help a lot.
 You don't want your performance meter to be down on the red when the triplets of death solo hits you. Listen for the amount of drum hits on the slowest speed (there are about six to ten per line of green notes) if you struggle to find the tempo: the guitar and snare drum follows the same tempo.
 Keep it anchored there while trying to hit the rest of the note with your other fingers.
 If the triplet goes Green-Red-Yellow, strum the Green note and then slide your fingers upwards the neck to try to hit the other notes. This requires practice and possibly sweaty fingers to make them glide easier. You might find not holding in the lowest button easier in some cases.
 Be sure you can handle it. Finger-gliding works pretty well on it, as long as you do not anchor (permanently press down a button) any notes and uses all fingers in the process.

 Once dry, tap the soles together to clear the treads. Use an old toothbrush to scrape off the larger pieces of dirt and debris.








This prep work will make for easier stain removal and washing.
 Make a solution of equal parts water and baking soda in a small bowl. Dip the toothbrush in and gently massage the paste into the soles Then, wipe the soles clean.
 Run a gentle cycle with cold water., Use about half of what you normally would for a load of laundry. Add the detergent when the machine is about halfway filled with water.
 Let the cycle run its course and then take out the shoes when it's finished., Do not place them in the dryer or over a vent. This will result in shrunken and distorted shoes. Place the shoes in a well ventilated area and let them air dry., They should be as white as new!

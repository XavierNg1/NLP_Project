 Of course, it's not possible to stay inside all the time. However, when you know seasonal allergens are in the air, try staying away from the great outdoors. The less you expose yourself, the better your allergies will be.If you're allergic to ragweed, try to avoid mornings outside, while it's best to avoid being outside in the afternoon and evening if you're allergic to grass pollen.
If you're not sure when your allergies will be bad, check local pollen, mold, and grass counts.
 Another way to help your allergies is to seal the allergens outside as much as possible. That is, don't keep your windows or doors open, as that just lets allergens in. Instead, use your air conditioner to cool down your house., You pick up allergens on your skin and clothes when you go outdoors. It can help to shower before you go to sleep, so you're not taking those allergens to bed with you. You'll be giving yourself a break, and therefore, you're more likely to wake up looking refreshed., Even if you do shower before bed, dust and other allergens can build up. Make sure you are washing your sheets regularly, at least once a week. Use hot, soapy water to clean them, and dry them on hot.If washing your sheets regularly doesn't seem to help, try switching to a soap meant for sensitive skin, which should have fewer allergens in it.
 If you are allergic to your cat or dog, make sure to get them bathed often to cut down on allergens. Once a week is ideal. Also, make sure to vacuum or dust often to help remove animal dander from your home.

 If your child is not totally satisfied with the story, let her rewrite the story as she sees fit. She make the story go in an entirely different, and even more exciting direction.
 If your child has written her story, but feels that it could use some details, help her to replace boring words with more flowery or engaging language. Help her to look over her descriptions and come up with ways to make the description more engaging.


Brainstorm adjectives, epithets, and descriptions for characters, places, and events.
 Editing the story is very important. Help your child to read through the story and find any sections that don’t really make sense, or that don’t seem to fit with the rest of the story.


Proofread the story together with your child, correct the errors , suggest details, and look for awkward sections together.

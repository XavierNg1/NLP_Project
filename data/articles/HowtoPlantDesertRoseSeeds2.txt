 If the containers you use do not have drainage holes, you should poke one hole into the bottom of the container before proceeding. In the case of plastic seedling trays, this can be done by poking the tip of a pen or large needle into the bottom of each compartment. The hole does not need to be large.
 Vermiculite works well, as does a mix of soil and sand or soil and perlite.
 If using seedling trays or containers with a diameter of four inches (ten centimeters) or less, only plant one seed per compartment. If using a larger pot, spread several seeds evenly over the soil.
 Only use enough soil to just barely cover the seeds, preventing them from blowing away. The seeds should not be buried deeply.
 The stones should completely cover the bottom of the tray, and the water should not rise above the level of the stones.
 Refresh the water daily to provide the seeds with sufficient water from below.
 Use a spray bottle until the surface of the soil feels moist to the touch.
 During germination, the soil and its seeds should be kept at a temperature between the range of 80 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (27 to 29 degrees Celsius). Periodically test the soil with a thermometer to monitor the temperature accurately.
 This should occur within the first week or two. You should still water the seedlings from below for the first month.
 Each seedling should have about six “true leaves” at the time of transplant.

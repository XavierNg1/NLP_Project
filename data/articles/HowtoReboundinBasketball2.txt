 As soon as you see the ball come off the glass or the rim of the basket, spring up with your arms outstretched. You want to grab the ball as quickly as you can to secure a rebound.








Be aggressive in moving towards the ball. If you are afraid to jump because someone else is jumping as well, you will have a lesser chance of getting the rebound. Even if another player is going for the ball, take the risk and jump. You may be the first one to get the rebound.
Keep your arms stretched toward the ball as you jump. Keep your eye on the ball, following its movements so you can best aim your grasp.
 Always try to grab the ball with both hands. Rebounding with one hand will give your opponents an opportunity to swat the ball away easily and take possession for themselves.








Hug the ball to your body as you come down. This protects the ball from being intercepted from other players as you come down from your jump.
Extend your elbows outward in a defensive position. This also discourages other players from grabbing the ball from your arms.
As you reach the ground, pull the ball up to your chin. This prepares you to pass the ball to a teammate.
 As soon as you grasp the ball, scan the court. Look for an open teammate moving down court to pass the ball. Give a quick pass out to send the ball towards your basket.









If you got an offensive rebound, try to put the ball back up for a basket. If you donâ€™t have an open shot, pass or dribble the ball out to get a better position on the net.
If you're rebounding your own shot, try to immediately throw the ball towards the basket again if you have an open shot.

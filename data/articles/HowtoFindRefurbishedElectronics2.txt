 For instance, North American electronics retailer Best Buy still deals in some refurbished electronics.
 Locate stores in your area, and ask if they offer deals on refurbished products. For example, the Frye’s chain in the southwest United States carries some refurbished products.
 Often, shoppers can get factory-direct refurbished goods from the electronics manufacturers’ factory outlet stores. For example, Sony operates a small number of factory outlets across the U.S. that provide a lot of deals on refurbished Sony TVs, phones, laptops, and much more. These factory outlets are a prime place for cashing in on the deals that manufacturers provide for their entire product line. Look into your country’s factory outlet locations to see if Sony or another major electronics vendor is represented.

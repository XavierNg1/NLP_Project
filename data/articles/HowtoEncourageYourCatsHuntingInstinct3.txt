 Food is an essential part of encouraging your cat’s hunting instincts. In the wild, eating comes after a successful hunt. Schedule your playtimes before meals to simulate the natural conclusion of a successful hunt.If you free-feed your cat, offer it a treat after playing with it. Just make sure treats don’t exceed 10 to 15 percent of its caloric intake.
 Watch your cat play with a food dispenser to make sure it can figure out the puzzle. Help your cat figure the toy out if it gets bored or gives up.Avoid using dispenser toys to exclusively feed your cat, especially if it’s home alone most of the day. It won’t be able to eat if it can’t get into the dispenser, and cats can’t handle going long periods of time without food.
 Look online, at a garden center, or at a pet store for wheat or oat grass meant for cats. Make sure it’s specifically marked for cats, as some plants can be toxic to cats.Grow it in a pot or planter, and hide treats for your cat to hunt.

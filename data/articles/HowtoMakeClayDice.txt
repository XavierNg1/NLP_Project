 The piece of clay must be equivalent to the size that you want your dice to be.;
,, Discard any pieces that are not equal in size.
 Make one ball for each die. The ball does not need to be perfect.
 Squeeze the top and bottom, then left and right sides, then front and back sides. Repeat this squeezing process until the piece of clay resembles a perfect cube.







"2" and "5" are placed opposite one other.






"3" and "4" are placed opposite one other.






Simply remember the number placement like this: the numbers opposite each other equal 7. (1+6=7; 2+5=7, etc.)







, Bake in a low-temperature oven; 250ºF or 121ºC is a good, low temperature. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until properly baked.
 The die will still seem a little soft while hot; just leave them to harden on a cooling rack and only touch when they've cooled off completely. Once cooled, they're ready to use.

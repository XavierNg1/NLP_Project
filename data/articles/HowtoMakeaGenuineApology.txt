 Whether it was on purpose or an accident, admit that you did it. People like honesty.;
, Stick to the idea of re-establishing a good relationship. This is not the time to work out and dissect events.
 Be prepared for it to take some time for your apology to be processed. This may be a long moment, a few minutes, or even days or weeks. Be patient and hopeful. Sometimes apologies have to be repeated. Don't let pride keep you from calling or writing again. The injured party may have trouble calming down, they may remain hurt or angry, and you must persist within reason. It is important to keep follow up messages light and casual. One must understand when to stop the effort as well.
, An apology will be better accepted if it is sincere.
 For instance, "I am sorry I forgot your birthday after all these years. Your friendship means so much to me I hope you will forgive me."

, Smiling generally expresses happiness but you should be serious. If you want to smile, try to have an apologetic smile.
 Often people use flowers, or pay for lunch if they are eating together. You might say, "Let me get this check, it's my pleasure." If you know a person's favorite things this can be more personal. Wrap a small gift in attractive paper or bag and bring it with you for your apology; it will serve as a little sweetener to the situation. Or say, let's go to lunch, it would be my treat.
 Refer to the person, talk about what you have done, and why it won't happen again. Don't say, "I hope." It should NEVER happen again.
 An apology is saying sorry. Sorry means not doing it again. It's supposed to be genuine.
 I see that it is creating problems for everyone."

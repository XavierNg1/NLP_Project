 These also contain calcium, although it is far less than the amount found in dairy. You would need to eat 5 cups of broccoli to get as much calcium as you can get in one glass of milk. However, these vegetables are low in calories and full of vitamins so if you enjoy them, you can eat just about as much as you want.;

The cheapest available are antacids, such as Tums. For most people, these are generally sufficient. There are also calcium chews available that taste like chocolate or caramel. Both of these forms must be chewed very thoroughly and taken with water.
There are also big calcium pills that you can take. You should take these with plenty of water. It is also important to note that your body will only absorb about 500mg in a sitting. So if you choose to take supplements, take one in the morning and one in the evening. Do not take two doses at the same time.
If you take a multivitamin, check the label. Most popular multivitamins do not contain a lot of calcium.

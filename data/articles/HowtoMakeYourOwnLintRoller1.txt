 You will need:A cylindrical object. A cardboard tube may be the best option, but a thick wooden dowel would work as well. The circumference should be several inches in length; if the cylinder is too small it will not work as a roller.
Tape. Nearly type of tape will do. Masking tape is probably closest to the sticky paper used on most lint rollers. Wide rolls of tape are the easiest to use, but any can be made to work.
Scissors (if the tape does not come with a cutting tool).;
, Just pull 5–6 inches (12.7–15.2 cm) of tape loose at once. Do not cut it yet.
 Use a portion of the sticky side of the tape to attach it to the cylinder. After it is secure, gently wrap the tape around the cylinder in the opposite direction (glue side out). You may need to hold the tape in place with your finger for the first few moments after you change directions.









Leave the ends of the cylinder exposed. You can hold onto it at these ends.
If you are using narrow strips of tape, start by attaching the tape near one end of the cylinder, and then with each wrap move the tape further down toward the other end. After you approach the end of the side opposite to the one you started on, you can reverse the process. It will work best if you make sure there is a slight overlap as you wrap the tape around in order to stick the tape to itself.
 You may find it most efficient to wrap an entire roll of tape at one time, enabling you to use the roller for quite some time before you will have to repeat this process again.
 Run the roller over the fabrics that need cleaning. As the exterior layers of tape become covered in lint, you can peel them off and expose the fresh layers below.

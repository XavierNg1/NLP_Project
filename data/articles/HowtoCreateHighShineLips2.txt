 Dampen this pile with hot water and scrunch it into a small ball. Wet it again, this time with hotter water and squeeze out the excess water. Gently rub the paper ball against and around your lips, to lift of the dead skin cells and make them smooth and soft.


The toilet paper is usually better, as it's softer than paper towel.
 Smoothly apply the lip balm.


Try not to lick the flavor off all day.
 Use your fingertips to apply over the lips.
 You can even skip the balm and just use the petroleum jelly.

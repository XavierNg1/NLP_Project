 The worst thing you can be is stubborn. Understand that she is her own person and that you can’t push anything on her. Let her make her own decisions without constantly disagreeing with them.


For example, if she wants to get a tattoo and you really don’t like tattoos try to be open about it. Maybe you’ll end up thinking it is very attractive.
 When you’re in a very intimate relationship it can be easy to find yourself getting frustrated or being less patient than you normally would be. Never snap at the person.


For example, if you find yourself getting in a fight make sure you stay calm and civil to make it more of a debate than a fight. Don’t yell at her.
 You can always find a middle ground. You don’t have to be a pushover, but be willing to bend your stance if it helps the relationship. If you really care about her this shouldn't be difficult. Try to be easy going. For example if she really wants to see one movie and you want to see a different one, ask her if she might be willing to see the movie you want to see next weekend if you watch hers this weekend.
 Even if you disagree about one topic, don’t be afraid to ask her opinions about different topics. Not only will you get to know her better, but you’ll also show that you still really value her opinion even if you don’t agree about that one subject.
 If you are going to stick to your guns and continue to disagree with your girlfriend, make sure you do it in a respectful and nice way.


Say something like, “well I don’t know, I still think what I think – but you have made some really good points that I’ll have to consider.”

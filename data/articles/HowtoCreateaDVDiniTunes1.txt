Launch iTunes on your computer.
Point to "File," then point to "Library," and select "Back up to disc."
Select your preferred backup option and verify that your disc burner is shown next to "Disc Burner." You can choose to back up your iTunes library and playlists, or just your purchases from the iTunes store.
Click on the "Next" button to proceed to the backup process.



Insert the blank DVD into the drive of your burner. ITunes will then scan your disc to determine if enough space exists to efficiently back up the files you indicated.
If your blank DVD does not contain enough space for your files, iTunes will notify you and provide you with the option to use multiple discs for the backup procedure.
Click on the "Continue" button to begin the burning process. ITunes will notify you when the backup procedure has been completed.

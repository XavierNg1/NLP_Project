 If you have boy relatives (everybody does), buy some mini flashlights and small gadgets and put them along with the girl stuff. Other things to buy are lip gloss, iTunes cards, nail polish, etc. Make sure you have colored tissue paper and small gift bags to wrap it! Be sure to remember where you placed them, because nothing is worse then forgetting a present!;
, Neatly place the item(s) inside. Make it look professional! Take the tops of the tissue paper at the bottom, and bring them to the top, hiding the spot where you can see the gift with extra tissue paper!

, Forgot gifts? Make a card! Place a couple dollars inside the card, to make up for no gift! Make sure you also include a card with the gift, present or not. It's always friendly when you give a merry, bright card!

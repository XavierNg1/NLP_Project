 For many newly out or closeted lesbians, online dating is their first opportunity to feel accepted, flirt, and overcome introversion about their sexuality. Maybe that's all your looking for, maybe you're looking for casual sex, or maybe you're interested in long-term romantic relationships. Think about your comfort level and what your goals are before you enter the digital dating world.
 The LGBT online dating scene has grown tremendously in the past ten years. Here are a few of the more popular sites and apps:LGBT-specific: Her (lesbian-only dating and social networking), Chemistry.com, Compatible Partners (for serious relationships only), Brenda
All-purpose dating: OK Cupid, Match.com, and eHarmony all have lesbian options. Hinge seems to tailor results for LGBT people better than other "swipe" apps.
 Online dating has its perils, so don't take chances. Keep your personal information private, use a free email without your real name, and meet up with strangers in public locations. In addition, if you are not out to everyone in your life, take extra steps to prevent nosy employers or family members from finding you. Most sites allow you to hide your profile until you've agreed to accept communications from someone, but this option makes it harder to make connections.


Ok Cupid has an "I don't want to be seen by straight people" checkbox in the privacy settings.Chances are good that your straight friends won't be browsing an LGBT-only dating site. Just make sure the profile doesn't show up when you google your name.
 Unfortunately, there is a minor plague of straight women contacting lesbians for a threesome with their boyfriend. Forestall some of this — and make your intentions clear to other lesbians — with a clear, direct description in your bio. "Lesbian seeking same" is a simple example.

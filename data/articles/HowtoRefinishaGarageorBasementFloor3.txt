 You must use epoxy within 2 hours for it to work, so make sure everything you need is ready to go and work quickly.
 Concrete epoxy coating will come in 2 cans: an epoxy paint and a hardener. Stir the paint until it is completely mixed and let it sit for the amount of time the manufacturer recommends -- usually 30 minutes. As it sits, the chemicals in the mixture will warm up, making the can feel warm.
 Use a paint brush to paint the trim area around the entire garage or basement surface.
 Use extension handle so you can easily stand.


Start at the farthest corner and work in the same 10-by-10 foot (3-by-3 m) sections you used to apply the etching solution. Roll the paint on one direction, then go back and paint the same area in a perpendicular direction before moving on to the next section. Let the floor dry completely.
If you are adding any color flakes to the paint, do this in the sections as you paint. Sprinkle the flakes on sparingly at first, then add more layers until you get to the consistency you desire. Color flakes cover up flaws in the concrete.

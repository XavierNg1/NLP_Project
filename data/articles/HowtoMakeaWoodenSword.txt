 Keep your spine straight and your shoulders back. Your arms should hang loosely at your sides. Your hands and fingers should also be loose and pointing down at the floor., The term "dominant hand" refers to the hand you are most comfortable with for precision tasks. This generally equates to the hand you use to write, handle tools, or throw a ball.In some cases, your sword hand may not be the same as the hand you use for writing or using tools.
To verify your sword hand, hold a straight piece of wood or a household item. This should be roughly the length of your forearm. The hand in which this is most comfortable is your sword hand.
 When you spread your fingers out, the space between your thumb and forefinger will form a V-shape. With your hand still loose at your side and your fingers pointing toward the ground, use a tape measure to determine the distance between the same side eye as your dominant hand and the base of this V-shape in your dominant hand.This measurement can be difficult to take accurately without help. You may want a friend or family member to assist you in this.
 Generally, when you are within a ½ in (1.2 cm) of the next full inch mark, round up to the next inch. When you are over a ½ in from the next full inch, round down to the next full inch mark.Depending on the kind of sword you are using, sizing conventions can vary. These measurements are for a modern, straight bladed military saber.
Most mass produced bladed weapons, like swords, are broken down into sizes. These sizes are generally in standardized increments, like 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm).
As an example of a sword with a different size expectation, a traditional broadsword ranges from 30 to 45 inches (76.2 to 114.3 cm)., Use a piece of wood that's slightly larger than your ideal size. This will allow you to some room for error when you use a knife to shave away excess wood with a knife to shape your sword.

To check your wood for rottenness, strike it against a hard surface. If it breaks or cracks, select another piece of wood., Use a pencil to draw the approximate shape of your sword on the 2x4. This shape can be curved, like a traditional katana or scimitar, or straight edged on both sides with an angled or triangular point.

When drawing your outline, remember the cross guard of the sword. This is located at the base of the blade, between the blade and handle of the sword.The tip of swords are generally angled or pointed. Be sure to include this in your outline. A 45° angle from the tip to one side of the sword will provide a suitable angled point.
 Measure the ideal length of your sword on your wood and mark it with a pencil. Use a hand saw to cut free excess length from the wood. Remember to cut along the angle or point you've drawn on the wood for the point., A sharp woodworking knife will work best for this, but any sharp, sturdy knife can be used. Carve away wood to create the blade of your sword./images/thumb/c/c0/Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-4-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-4-preview-Version-3.jpg

For one-sided blades, the blade should narrow on its "sharp" side, creating a triangular shape. The wood should thicken toward the opposite, non-bladed side.
For double sided swords, the shape of the blade will be roughly that of a diamond. The thickest part of this blade will be at the center of the blade, with both "edged" sides thin.
 A somewhat elliptical (oval) shape will work best for your handle, which should be thinner than the blade. The cross guard should also be thin and form the crossing part of a t-shape between the blade and handle./images/thumb/7/7b/Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg

An oval shape will be more comfortable to hold onto when using your sword than a purely circular one.To make a distinct cross guard, a file will work best. Use your knife to form the general outline at this point. Later, you'll use sandpaper to smooth it, and a file to make it distinct.
 Hold your sword in your hand. If it feels heavy, continue using your knife to shave away wood from the thickness of the blade and handle.

Some wood is heavier than others. Heavier woods may require very thin blades and handles for them to be of comfortable weight.
Making the blade and handle of your sword too thin can compromise your sword's sturdiness.
 Use medium grit sandpaper (60 to 100 rating) to take off rough, irregular edges and burrs from the wood. Use firm pressure and to rub the wood with the sandpaper.

Be patient with this process. Sanding can take a while, but a well sanded sword will look more professional made.
To speed up this process, you could clamp your sword to a work bench and use a hand sander., This will make your sword look stylish, but will also provide you a better grip on the handle when using your sword. Wind electrical tape around the handle of your sword to make a grip./images/thumb/d/d3/Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-9-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-9-preview-Version-3.jpg

Sweat from your hand along with the force of hitting something with your sword can jostle it from your grasp if you don't have a grip.
Alternatively, you can use duct tape for the grip of your sword. Different patterns/colors of tape can be used to suit your preference.
 A file will allow you to make more precise, deeper notches in the top of the handle and bottom of the blade. Take your file and remove wood directly above and below the cross guard.

Using a file in this fashion will better separate your cross guard from the handle and blade the sword.
 Cut a piece of wood, plastic, or metal in a circular shape that is roughly 2 in (5 cm) thicker than your sword handle. Cut a hole directly in the center of this that is just barely larger than your sword handle.

Slide the separate cross guard piece up the handle. The guard should catch where the blade thickens and go no farther.
To hold your cross guard in place, wrap twine or string around the guard. Alternate between the top and bottom of the guard so the string winds along the base of the blade and top of the handle. Tie the string off in a simple knot.
 Tie tassels to the base of the handle of your sword.Use a marker to draw designs on the blade. Etch designs in your sword with a knife./images/thumb/a/ae/Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-13-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-13-preview-Version-3.jpg

To make a sheath, cut one long sleeve off of an old shirt. sew one end of a long sleeve closed. Slide your sword inside, and you're done.

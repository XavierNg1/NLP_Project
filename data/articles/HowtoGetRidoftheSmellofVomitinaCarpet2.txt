 Using 100% detergent isn't safe for all types of carpet, so create a solution that's 1 part detergent to 2 parts water. Using a bristled brush, gently scrub the detergent into the stain, making sure to get the edges as well as the inside.
 Or use your shop vac, whichever. But if you only have a towel, apply it to the stain, keeping constant pressure on it. Continue applying pressure until the stain is virtually dry and the towel has soaked up everything.
 This type of cleaner can be found in pretty much any cleaning aisle or with the pet products -- it's stuff that will say something along the lines of, "Blasts away bad smells!" on the label; Kids ‘n Pets and Nature’s Miracle are two well-known examples. They break down the proteins that cause odors and can help with stains, too.


Be sure to leave it on for a few hours, giving it time to take hold. And when we say "wet," we mean wet. Thoroughly saturated. Don't worry about rationing the bottle for the next time. The entire area should be bordering on soaked.
 After those few fateful hours have passed, dry the area with a towel or your wet/dry vacuum. Again, if you're using a towel, be patient. It may take applying constant pressure for an hour or so to truly dry the area.
 If the smell is still there, that's normal. It probably won't go away until the area is completely, 100% dry. Leave it overnight and come back in the morning to carpet that's puke free!

 Focus in particular on ensuring that the conditioner is covering the part of the doll's hair that has the crayon on it. Rub in a little but not so much that you mess up the hair.

Note: This method should only be used on a doll that can be washed. If the doll surface might be harmed by water or conditioner, this method is not suitable.;
, Put the doll down on a towel in a cool, dry spot to let the conditioner work into the hair., Use lukewarm water and gently cleanse the hair, removing the crayon as follows:

Part the hair into sections for working on. Don't try to clean the whole area in one go, instead work methodically through each section covered in crayon.
As you wash the hair, gently scrape your finger along the crayon stained area, to remove the crayon with your fingers and nails. If you need more conditioner, add more to your fingers and run it over the hair.
Keep scraping in this way until all of the color lifts off. The crayon should come off easily with the conditioner.
 Use lukewarm water to cleanse the hair of all remaining conditioner and any pieces of crayon left. Use a small measuring jug or a cup to stream the water over the hair gently., Leave the doll on a towel in a warm, dry place to dry overnight. Do not place near a heater, to avoid harming the doll.

 The podiatrist may ask your child to sit, stand, raise his toes while standing, and to stand on his tiptoes. He may also check your child’s heel cord (the Achilles tendon) for any tightness and also look to see if the bottom of your child’s foot has any calluses, warts, ingrown toenails, or wear and tear.The podiatrist may also ask you if anyone in your family is flat footed and if there is a history of neurological or muscular disease in your family.
The podiatrist may get x-rays of your child’s feet to get a closer look at the bone structure.
 Once the podiatrist has assessed your child’s feet, he will diagnose the cause of your child’s pain. If your child is flat footed, but it is not too severe, or if he is suffering from Sever's disease, or pediatric heel, the podiatrist may recommend non surgical options such as:Resting and avoiding activities that cause pain until the symptoms go away.
Over-the-counter pain medication and anti inflammatory medication.
Stretching exercises to extend the heel cords on both feet.Over-the-counter cushioned arch supports for your child’s shoes.
Custom made orthotics for your child’s shoes to balance out their feet and support any sensitive areas on their feet.
Physical therapy to strengthen any weak areas in your child’s feet.
 In some cases, a child’s flat footedness cannot be corrected with non surgical options and may require foot surgery. Your podiatrist will refer you to a foot surgeon who can then walk you through the surgical procedure.


Most foot surgeons recommend the child be at least eight years old to undergo surgery. The foot surgery for flat footedness will require the surgeon to lengthen your child’s Achilles tendon. The surgeon will also lengthen your child’s heel bone using a bone graft that is inserted on the outer side and edge of the middle of the foot in a procedure called calcaneal lengthening osteotomy.

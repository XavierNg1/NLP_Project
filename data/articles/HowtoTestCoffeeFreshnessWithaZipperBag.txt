 Make sure that there is enough room for the beans and for expansion.;
, The fastest way to do this is to press down and roll the beans towards the bag opening. Be sure that there are no air pockets. Zip and seal the bag while it's still rolled up.


Another way to remove air from a bag is to zip the bag except for the last half inch, gently pinch each end of the half inch unzipped seam, push together slightly to open the seam, and use your lips/mouth to gently suck the air from the bag (it is easy if you use a straw to suck the air out), pinching and zipping the bag closed. You can actually get a good "vacuum" in the bag this way with practice.
 The ideal place would be next to your usual coffee containers.,


If the bag is puffed up, the beans are within 7-10 days of roasting, signaled by the fact that they're still releasing carbon dioxide.
If the bag is still flat, the beans have passed their freshness peak.

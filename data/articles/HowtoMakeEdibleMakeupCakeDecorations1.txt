 Fondant is thick sugary dough that is often used for cake decorating. You can color it and shape it into all sorts of designs, so it is perfect for making edible makeup.


Fondant is available in the cake decorating section of craft stores.
You will need one package or one recipe to make your edible makeup.;
, You can purchase pre-dyed fondant or dye fondant to be almost any color, but you should take some time to plan out what colors you will need. For example, if you want to make a lipstick for your cake, then you might need some red or pink fondant. If you want to make an eyeshadow palette, then you might want some green, purple, or blue fondant.


Jot down the makeup items you want to make and what colors you think you will need to make them.
Since most makeup is cased in black plastic, black fondant is essential for making edible makeup.
To dye fondant, you will need to use food safe dye. You can purchase all kinds of different dye colors for cake decorating in craft stores.
 When you are ready, put on a pair of food-safe vinyl gloves and break your fondant into pieces. Then, add dye to the fondant using a toothpick. Stick a clean toothpick into the dye and then stick it into the fondant to transfer the dye.Make sure that you discard toothpicks after they have touched the fondant. Do not dip them into the dye again.
It is almost impossible to dye fondant black, so you will probably need to buy black fondant at a craft store.Other dark colors, such as red, can be difficult to achieve, so you may want to purchase these colors as well.
 When you have added some dye to the fondant, begin mixing it with your gloved hands. Knead the dough to distribute the color evenly. Keep kneading until the color looks uniform.If the color is not as dark as you want it to be, then get a new toothpick, add some more dye, and knead again.
If the color is too dark, then add some white fondant and knead the dyed piece with the white piece to lighten the color.

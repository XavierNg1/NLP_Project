 Breast milk is only good for about 24 hours after thawing, so don’t freeze more than one day’s worth of milk in a single container. You can store your milk in plastic bags or freezable bottles--two to four ounces is best for each container., The composition of your breast milk changes as your baby gets older, so don’t use breast milk more than four months old. Labeling your milk will help you make sure your baby is getting the best milk for his or her developmental stage., Store new milk in the back of the freezer. That way, the first portion you use is always the oldest., Make it part of your nightly routine to take the next day’s portion of milk out to thaw. That way you won’t be stuck without milk and you won’t be tempted to thaw the milk too quickly!

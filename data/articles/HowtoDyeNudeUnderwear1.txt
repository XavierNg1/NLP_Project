  If you tan in the sun, you may wish to take a different picture at a different time and make two separate dye batches.;
,  Most brands offer a range of colors from Tan to Chocolate Brown.
  Some dye products only work in hot water and others work with cold water.  It is important to know if your fabric is colorfast and whether or not it will shrink in hot water.  If so, then make sure you use a cold water dye.
  Mix the dye and water.  Stir until the dye is dissolved and mixed thoroughly.  Place the item in the dye bath.  Stir until completely saturated.  Check in 5 minute intervals until the item is slightly darker than the picture.  Remove and rinse and then hang to dry.
  A plastic bucket or tub is very effective for dying most articles of clothing.  Make sure you use rubber gloves so you don't dye your skin.

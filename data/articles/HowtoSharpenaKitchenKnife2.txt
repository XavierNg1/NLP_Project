 The long steel rod that most people consider a "sharpening rod" is actually used for honing the blade, which centers the edge for even cutting. Because it makes the blade cut more efficiently, it seems sharper. But real sharpening uses specialty stones to actually fix the edge and doesn't need to be done regularly.










Honing needs to be done regularly. Some chefs hone every single time they use their knives. You should hone the blade immediately after any sharpening.

Sharpening can be done at home or professionally, and only needs to be done once or twice a year., Hold the rod from the top of the handle, with the end on the ground. You can put a dish towel underneath it to help keep it in place.
 This is not the angle you want to sharpen at, it is just a step to help you get the right angle. Start with the blade perpendicular to the rod, then pick your hand up to angle the blade down at a 45-degree angle to the rod.


Start near the handle of the blade.
 This doesn't have to be precisely measured, but you should get used to this angle. If you're struggling, just think about being roughly halfway to 45-degrees. Remember that the blade is pointing down to the counter, not up., Keeping the blade at this 20-degree angle, draw the blade back towards you on a straight line. You should only need 4-5 passes if you hone the blade regularly, but 8-10 if you haven't done it in a while.









You want to use gentle, fluid pressure through each draw. Making it a quick, even motion will help.
 In order to center the blade, you need to hone both sides the same number of times.
 You'll notice the grooves on the rod becoming smooth, and it won't actually help you much anymore. Luckily, these things are cheap.

 Sticking to a careful, consistent exercise regime will help you prepare for labor. There are a few exercises that can help you practice movements you will use during delivery to make it as easy as possible. Tailor sitting teaches you how to sit during labor to best support your back and pelvis. Kegel exercises strengthen your pelvic organs. Squatting during labor helps open your pelvis to give the baby more room, but can tire moms quickly. Pelvic tilts can relieve backaches and ease delivery.To practice tailor sitting, sit on the floor with your back straight and your legs out straight. Press your knees gently into the floor with your elbows. Hold the stretch for 10 second and repeat 5 to 10 times.
Kegels imitate the effort you would make in stopping and starting urination. Do slow Kegels by contracting your pelvic muscles for 3 to 10 seconds. Relax, and repeat up to 10 times. For fast Kegels, contract and relax your pelvic muscles quickly 25 to 50 times. Relax for 4 seconds and repeat. Do up to four sets.
To practice squatting, do a wall slide. Stand with your back against the wall and your feet 6 inches in front of you, shoulder width apart. Slowing slide down the wall into a squat, with your thighs parallel to the floor. Hold for 5 to 10 seconds and then slide back up slowly. Repeat 5 to 10 times.
Pelvic tilts are easiest done on your hands and knees on the floor. First pull in your abdominal muscles while arching your back like a cat. Hold for several seconds. Release the stretch, returning to a flat position. Repeat 3 to 4 times, up to 10 repetitions total.

 Starting with the basic wrap, hold your baby against your chest, either facing you (for the chest-to-chest position) or facing out (for the back-to-chest position).
 Pull on the fabric across your shoulder and slip one of your baby’s feet on one side of the fabric and the other on the opposite side.
 Carefully tuck your baby’s legs under the fabric that’s wrapped around your waist.
 Pull on the fabric around your waist and stretch it up to your baby’s neck, making sure to keep the fabric under your baby’s bottom.

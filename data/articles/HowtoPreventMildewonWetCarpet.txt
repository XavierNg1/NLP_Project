 Be careful to protect yourself from being stuck by carpet staples and tacks. Take the carpet outside and lay it flat on a dry, paved area such as a patio or driveway, preferably in full sunlight. A sloping driveway that would help pull water away from the carpet would be best.;
, Quickly removing any residue left on the floor from the water will minimize the growth of mildew and unpleasant odors remaining in the house.
 Use a sweeping motion, starting at one end, working from side to side. Turn the carpet over and hose the back side in the same manner. Turn the carpet over again so that the right side is facing up and spray it once more.
 Leave it to soak for a few minutes, then rinse thoroughly.
 While using bleach will typically lessen or remove any remaining stains, it will probably change the color of the carpet.


Mix 2-1/2 cups (.59 l) of liquid chlorine bleach in a 5 gallon (18.9Â L) (18.9 l) bucket. Using undiluted bleach will dissolve wool fibers in the carpet and may irritate your skin.
Dribble the bleach mixture on wet carpet. Use a plastic brush to rub it into the carpet. After about 5 minutes, rinse the carpet thoroughly with a garden hose to remove all bleach residue.
 If the carpet must be dried indoors, turn on the air conditioning and use dehumidifiers to help pull out the moisture.

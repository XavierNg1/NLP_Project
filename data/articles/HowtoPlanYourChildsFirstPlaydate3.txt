 Extend an invitation to the parents to stay for the date, particularly if it is the first time their child has come over. It may put them at ease and opens the door for you to stay at their home if your child goes over there for a date. In addition, it may help their child feel safer and less shy.


Offer a tour of your home if you aren’t prepared to spend some one-on-one time with the parent. This tour may be used in lieu of having your own playdate. This may be acceptable for the parent, or they may be adamant about staying. It’s best to be prepared for either option., Always be mindful of the time when picking your child up from their first playdate. Coming late is disrespectful and may ensure your child isn’t invited over again. Stay in the area or leave extra early if you have a habit of being less than punctual.


Offer to drive the child home from your playdate if a parent is often late picking their child up. This prevents you from having to wait around on them and making you late for other activities you may have planned that day., There’s almost nothing worse than a parent who hovers during a playdate. However, it is still your job to manage the children. Intervene if you notice any disagreements or unsavory behavior.


Jump in by offering a snack if things start to go downhill. This provides a break for the kids and fills their tummies. Chances are they will get along again when snack time is over., Don’t wait until the parent comes for pick up to find all your guest’s gear. Get it together before it’s time to go home. This allows for a smoother transition when it’s time for the date to end.


Have the kids play outside while waiting for the parent to come. Being outside already may prevent any meltdowns over the date ending, as they are already outside and will just simply have to walk to the vehicle.

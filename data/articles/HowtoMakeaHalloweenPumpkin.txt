 Buy one that's a good size with little visible damage/marks.;
, Make it big enough to fit your arm and a scraping tool through (a diameter of about 6 inches is recommended).
 Make sure you do so at an angle (tip of the knife facing the center of the pumpkin) so that the lid doesn't fall into the pumpkin. You may want to cut a small notch into the lid too so it doesn't fall.
 Scrape away the walls until they're about an inch thick. There should be no seeds or pumpkin strings left.
 Leave to dry overnight if desired.
 Thinner bits will be harder to cut out.
Pick one that suits the size of the pumpkin.



Premade patterns:

Print it out to the right size.
Cut along the edges inwards so it folds round across the curve of the pumpkin.
Tape it down using masking tape.


Your own pattern:

Use a washable marker to draw the pattern directly onto the pumpkin.
 Make small dots in the pumpkin all around the edges of the shape you're going to cut out. Keep them close together.
If you used a premade pattern, carefully remove the paper.
Get a pumpkin carving knife (or most normal knives will work) and poke it all the way through the edge of one of the shapes. Alternatively, you can make your pumpkin glow by using a chisel knife (you can buy them from most art stores) or similar tool to glide along the pumpkin, following the edge of the design. Remove the only top layer of skin (do not poke all the way through).
Slowly move the knife around the shape following the dots.
Once you've gone all the way round, push the shape out and carefully run your knife around the edge again to neaten the cut up.
Repeat for each shape.



Add food coloring.
Reuse the cut-out pumpkin or insides as part as part of the design.
Stick skewers into the pumpkin to look like arms or hair

Run your finger across the logo to make sure it feels smooth. The logo shouldn’t be a sticker, and should not flake off.
 While counterfeit phone makers usually do a good job of imitating the original product, you might notice inconsistencies. Find a friend with the same phone or visit a store that carries this model to check your phone against theirs. Here are a few things to check:Are the buttons are in the right place? Do they feel the same on both phones?
Are the phones the same weight?
Does your phone’s screen seem dull compared to the other phone? Colors not as vibrant?
Are the Sony logos exactly the same?

Open multiple apps at the same time and see if the phone can perform.

 When executing wrist twirls, also known as vertical twirls, the baton rotates up and down. The ball passes through the inside of your arm as the tip remains on the outside of your arm. Before you can master the wrist twirl, you must assume the appropriate stance.


Stand straight with your right arm at your side and your feet together.
Place your left hand on your hip. Your four fingers should be close together and resting on the front of your hip.
Hold the center of the shaft and point your thumb towards the ball., Start with the baton parallel to the ground with the ball facing forward.


Rotate the ball so that it is pointing at the ground; the tip should be on the outside of your arm.
Continue turning the baton so that the ball is pointing behind you.
Turn the baton so that ball is pointing up and is located on the inside of your arm.
Complete the rotationâ€”the baton should be parallel to the ground., Once you have mastered the pattern, speed up the twirl and adjust your hold on the baton.


Pinch the baton between your thumb and index finger.
Use your remaining fingers to turn the baton.
Keep your wrist loose., Baton twirlers must be able to execute twirls with both their dominant and non-dominant hand. As you work on the right wrist twirl, devote time to mastering the left wrist twirl. The left wrist twirl follows the same pattern as the right wrist twirl.

 Tree frogs love to eat the moths and insects that are attracted to light sources. Keep a garden light on for part or all of the night in order to create an irresistible feeding spot for them., You can provide tree frogs with natural habitat by avoiding trimming back bushes and tree branches near water or food sources. Keeping your trees and shrubs leafy and full will give frogs plenty of cover. It will also provide them with good hunting grounds., Tree frogs won’t gather in normal frog abodes on the ground; give them an alternative with a bit of height. Get a piece of PVC piping that’s about 5 feet long. Drive it into the ground so that roughly half of the pipe is left exposed.Place the PVC pipe about a foot from the base of a tree that’s near a water source.
Water may gather in the bottom of the pipe, but it should be absorbed by the underlying ground before it reaches a dangerous depth.
PVC pipe is available from most home improvement stores.
 Cut standard schedule-20 PVC piping into pieces that are about 2 feet in length. Cap the bottom-side of the pipe, and drill a hole about 3 or 4 inches above the capped bottom so that water can both gather and escape from the refuge.Drill two holes on one side of the top of each pipe. String the holes with heavy fishing line, and tie the refuges around a tree.
If possible, pick a tree that’s near a water source since that’s the place where frogs are most likely to congregate naturally.
Keep the PVC refuges at a height that is easy for you to reach. Take the caps off at least once a month so that water doesn’t stagnate in the bottom of them.

 Once your dog learns that barking on command leads to treats, it may be hard to get her to stop barking. The “speak” command should generate no more than 1-4 barks. After that, you’ll need to be able to ask your dog to stop., Wait for her to start barking.
 When your dog stops barking, give her the treat. Repeat this sequence, practicing ten minutes a day., Start by saying “quiet” without showing the treat, but still rewarding after your dog stops barking. When they have mastered this, you can start increasing the number of correct responses before giving treats. However, still give a treat every once in a while to keep your dog interested.
 When your dog has mastered “quiet” in a calm room, try the command in more distracting circumstance, like outside at the park or when a visitor comes to the door.

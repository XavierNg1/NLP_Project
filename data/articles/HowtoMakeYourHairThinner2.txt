 Section your hair as if you were doing a half-ponytail or half-bun. Pin the top section out of your way. Then grab a handful from the middle of the bottom section, making sure there is still a bit of hair underneath., Take the “handful” that you’ve chosen and divide it into two sections, side-by side. Braid the first section and secure it with a small rubber band. Then brain the second section., Now twist the braids around one another against your scalp. Aim to create a smooth circle of braids right against the back of your head. Then secure this braid circle with bobby pins., Release the top section of your hair that you moved out of the way, and style your hair normally. Your hair should appear noticeably thinner without needing any special products or cutting any hair!

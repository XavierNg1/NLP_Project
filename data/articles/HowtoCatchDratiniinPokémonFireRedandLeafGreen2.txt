 You can win a Dratini from here any time after you reach Celadon City for the first time. Dratini costs 2,800 Credits.
 You can use the slots machines to earn the credits you need, or if you don't have the time and have plenty of cash, you can buy the credits. If you want to gamble for them, one of the machines has better odds than the others, but it changes every time you enter the room.

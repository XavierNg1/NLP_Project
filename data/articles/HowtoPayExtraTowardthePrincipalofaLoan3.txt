 If you want to send extra money to a lender, it's not necessary to let the lender know ahead of time. However, communication is important to any smooth borrower/lender relationship. You want to assure extra funds are applied to the principal of your loan. Your borrower may assume the extra money is for your next payment. It's not a bad idea to let a lender know ahead of time if you're planning on putting extra money in one month to go towards the principal of a loan., Paying extra never means you don't owe your regular monthly payments. Keep a calendar to track when payments are due. Make sure you don't miss any payments, as this can affect your interest rates and credit.
 If you've switched your payment plan, you'll need to form a whole new budget. Many borrowers get overzealous and sign up for a payment plan they cannot keep manage. If you've switched to bi-weekly payments or another payment plan to requires extra money, spend some time budgeting for the extra money. Write down your income and how much you need to put towards the loan each month. Calculate other necessary expenses, like rent and bills. From there, figure out how much money you can reasonably spend on things like food, entertainment, and so on while paying off your loan.

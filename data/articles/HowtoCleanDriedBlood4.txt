 Wet a steel brush (available at hardware stores). Brush the stained area for 1-2 minutes. This movement should remove at least some of the coagulated, dried blood from the surface of the carpet fibers., In a bowl, mix one tablespoon of dish washing liquid with two cups (500 ml) of cold water. Dip a clean cloth into the mixture and dab the stain. Blot the stain repeatedly until it is removed, rinsing the cloth with cold water when necessary.For best results, use a detergent with enzymes.
 If the dried blood stain remains, treat it with a mixture 1/2 cup (125 ml) of cold water and one tablespoon of ammonia. Dip a clean sponge in the solution and dab the stain, working inwards to prevent it from spreading outwards to other areas of the carpet. Repeat until the stain is removed and then dab the area with a clean, wet sponge.

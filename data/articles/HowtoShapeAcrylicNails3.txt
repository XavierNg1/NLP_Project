 The natural shape of your lanula can help you to determine what type of nails would look good on you. The lanula, or moon, is the white area of the nail that is just above your cuticle. Choosing a shape that mirrors the lanula or moon will help to ensure that it complements your nails.Look at your lanula to determine what nail shape would look best on you.
For example, if you have rounded cuticles, then a round shape would look best. However, if your cuticles are somewhat square, then a square or squround shape would look best.
 Slim fingers will look good with almost any type of nail, but some nail shapes will complement wider fingers better while some shapes will make wider fingers appear even wider. Consider the length and width of your fingers to determine what type of nails might look best on you.


For example, square nails might make wider fingers look even heavier. Squround, squoval, oval, or round nails will look good on just about anyone. Almond shaped or stiletto nail can make your fingers look longer and slimmer.
 Checking out photos of nail shapes that you like may also help you to decide on what shape is right for you. Browse pictures of different nail shapes and lengths to get an idea of what you like and don’t like.


Try creating the Pinterest board of nail shapes that you like. This can help you decide what shapes are the most appealing to you.
 It is hard to know what will look good on you until you have tried it. If you are not sure what type of nail shape you want, then try starting with one that you can easily change into a different shape.


For example, you could start with square shaped nails and then transition to round nails if you don’t like the way the square shaped nails look.
Avoid starting with a look that would be difficult to adjust to another shape. For example, it would be hard to change almond-shaped or stiletto nails into a different shape because of how much nail you will need to file away to get these shapes.

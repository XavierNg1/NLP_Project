 Removing ivy from structures can be a bit tricky, as you don’t want to damage your walls/fences in the process of removal. You will mostly use your hands, but will also need gloves, garden shears, a hose/water, a wire brush, and dish detergent or weed killer.
 Start by hosing down the ivy with a bit of water, as this will soften the vines and roots a bit in order to make them easier to pull off. When you begin to remove the ivy, start from the top and work your way down, as this will give more time for the water to soak into the thicker vines near the bottom and make tugging easier for you., In order to prevent damage to your fence/building, use only your hands to gently tug the ivy away. If you come to a strong or thick vine of the ivy, use your gardening shears to snip it and then pull it off using your hands. Be as gentle as you can, because if you pull the ivy too hard it is likely to remove some of the wood or brick/mortar that is supporting your structure.
 When you’ve gotten all of the largest sections of ivy, including the vines and leaves, pulled off of your structure, you can use your stiff bristle or wire brush to scrape off the small tendrils the plant may have left behind. Use a dry brush to start, and wipe away as much of the plant as you are able.
 Fill a bowl or bucket with water and a strong dish detergent, and then continue scrubbing the walls down using this mixture and your stiff bristle brush. This will kill off any remaining plant on the structure, and help to wash off any debris or grime left behind from the ivy.
 If the tactics above don't do the job, try a weed killer. Make sure to choose one that will not damage surrounding plants or building materials, and follow all safety precautions on the label. It may take some time for the weed killer to take effect.

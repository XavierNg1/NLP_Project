 You will need numbers less than zero and more than zero.


Remember, on your negative number line zero will be in the middle. All the negative numbers will be to the left of zero and all the positive numbers will be to the right of zero.
 Find what number is first and which is second in the problem.


For example, in (-8) - (-3), the first number is -8 and the second is -3.
 This is where you will start.


If your problem was (-8) - (-3), you would put your finger on -8 on your number line.
 Subtracting a negative number is much like addition with regular numbers.


If you started on -8, you should now be on -7. You will have moved one space.
 This will make sure you end on the answer of your problem.


For example, if the second number in the problem is -3, you should have only moved 3 spaces on your number line.
 That number is the answer to your subtraction problem.


For example, in the problem (-8) - (-3), you would have started with your finger on -8 and would have moved 3 spaces to the right, ending on -5. (-8) - (-3) = -5.
 This is to check your answer.


If you don't get the same answer this time, try again to see where you made a mistake.

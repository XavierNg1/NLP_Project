 If you are using a bottle, remove the label and clean the interior and exterior of the bottle. Use mild dish soap and warm water to clean the bottle.


Allow for ample dry time before adding rope and cord. Make sure the inside of the vase or bottle is also completely dry.
 Add dabs of glue as you wind around the vase or bottle.


Cut the rope and glue in place when you are ready to add the colorful cord.






Push and re-position rope or cord if rope starts to sag or you see gaps as you work.
 Continue the process of wrapping and gluing as you work you way downward.


Cut and continue with cord and rope to create the desired design. Be sure you secure the last piece of cord or rope securely toward the bottom end of the bottle.

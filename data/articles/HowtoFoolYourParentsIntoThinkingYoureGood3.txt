 If you do have to go behind your parents’ back, avoid all the work that goes into a) coming up with a false story, b) telling it convincingly, c) coaching all your friends and collaborators in the same lie to back you up, and d) worrying about whether it will hold together. Instead, lie by omission when needed. Tell your parents what’s true and acceptable to them, and leave out what isn’t. For instance, if you’re going to your friend’s party while their parents are out of town, tell your parents only that you’re going over to your friend’s house. Don’t mention the party or that their parents are away. Although it’s not the whole truth, what you’ve said is technically true, so you’re less likely to give yourself away with nervous tics and tells.
 If your parents ask you a direct question that you can’t answer truthfully, avoid a direct answer. Instead, offer them a true statement that only seems to answer their question.Say your parents ask if your friend is a good kid. You know that, by their definition of “good,” the answer is no. Your friend smokes cigarettes, drinks beer, and sneaks out of his house at night. But despite all that, your friend’s a straight-A student. So, to answer your parents' question, simply answer, “He’s a straight-A student.”

, Ask yourself what they’re likely to ask you. Have an answer ready when they do. Avoid having to come up with a lie on the spot.

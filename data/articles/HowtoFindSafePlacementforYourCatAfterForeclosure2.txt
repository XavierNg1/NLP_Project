 You don’t want your cat to be a burden on the person or persons you leave it with. Therefore, ensure its vaccinations and checkups are up-to-date. If you aren’t leaving your cat in the care of your vet, provide the person or persons who will be caring for your cat with your vet’s name and contact info, and let your vet know that someone else will be caring for your cat for an indefinite period.Spay or neuter your pet before turning it over to a friend or family member. Spayed/neutered cats are much more amicable and tend to live healthier lives.You might want to fill out a medical release form authorizing your pet’s caretaker to take your cat to the vet if necessary.
If your cat requires medication, give it and the directions to your caretaker, too. Explain how much and how often the cat requires the medication.
 Don’t just drop your cat in someone else’s lap without educating them a bit about your cat’s personality and habits. For instance, is your cat affectionate and playful, or does it prefer solitude? Does it have a favorite toy? Does it like watching TV? Share your cat’s idiosyncrasies and habits with your cat’s caretaker before leaving it., Bring whatever food and toys your cat likes to person or organization who will be caring for your cat. Maintaining the cat’s diet and allowing it continued access to its favorite toys will minimize the disruption and stress on the cat. For the same reason, bring your cat’s bed, crate, food and water bowls, and litterboxes, too.If your cat has a leash, bring that, as well.
 If your cat gets sick or has any problems, your cat’s caretaker should feel free to contact you. Leave your number if they don’t already have it, and provide hours for your availability.

 It's best if you use a traditional wall calendar format on regular paper.;
, (Your net daily wage) $15 an hour for 40 hours is about $80 a day, 5 days a week.
 If rent is $400, and you make $80 a day, block out 5 days on the calendar. RENT, RENT, RENT, RENT, RENT. If you pay $80 a month on gas, block 1 day out on the calendar. Repeat for all expenses until all work days are full.
, Do it in one sitting.
 When you want to spend un-budgeted money, refer to the calendar and see where you can "get" the money. Update the calendar.

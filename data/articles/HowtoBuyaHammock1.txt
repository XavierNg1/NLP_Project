 Backyards, front yards, and campgrounds are the most popular places to put a hammock, while others will even opt to use one indoors in place of a more traditional piece of furniture like a chair or couch. Weighing the pros and cons of each location will give you the best sense of where the hammock should go.;
, If you’re having trouble deciding between multiple locations, feel free to try them all out once you have the hammock in hand.
 If you ultimately decide to purchase a large, less mobile hammock, you will need a great deal of space. Something more mobile—those attached to a movable frame, for example—are usually more compact and can even be transported from one location to another with minimal effort. As a general rule, create more space than you think you’ll need; you can always make adjustments later.

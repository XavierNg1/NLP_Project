 Run at least twice a week for about 1hour minutes. Do other things like push-ups, crunches, and planks. Also improve your flexibility. Having flexible shoulders, arms, and back will help you a lot with your tumbling. Exercises that can help improve flexibility are snake/seal stretches, bridges, splits, rocking bridges, backbend kickovers, front walkovers, straddle, pancake, and others.;
, Private lessons will help you work on a skill you need to improve on or really need to learn on something, like a back handspring or tuck.
 Mats, handspring machines, octagons, and rebound machines can really help.
 If you have a bad handstand, all your tumbling tricks will have bad landings. A round-off is another basic skill that is one of the most important skills in cheerleading and gymnastics.

 As you start working, drink one of the caffeinated beverages you have set aside. Drink it slowly, so the caffeine doesn't overwhelm your system and cause you to crash.For every caffeinated beverage you drink, drink a cup of water.
As the night goes on, increase the time between caffeinated beverages.
If you feel yourself falling into a slump, take a multivitamin.
 No matter how focused you are, at some point, your brain will hit a wall. Instead of working through the slump at your computer, use this time to get in some exercise.A quick workout can boost your brain's ability to learn and retain information, which will help you break through your slump.
Don’t do a full workout – instead, do some quick exercise in the form of 10 pushups, 10 jumping jacks or 10 sit ups.
 Pain stimulates the brain and keeps you from falling asleep. When you feel yourself nodding off, try pinching your thigh or eyebrow to give yourself a quick jolt.If pinching isn’t cutting it, splash cold water on your face for an added boost.
Lower the thermostat in your house or study area to keep your body alert.
Take a cold shower to freeze yourself awake.
 Melatonin, the hormone that makes humans sleepy, is brought on by darkness, so turn on your brightest lights. Try to work in a room with fluorescent lighting, if possible.The closer the light is to your eyes, the better, so try to work near a desk lamp or computer screen.
Change rooms every couple of hours so your eyes don’t have time to fully adjust to the bright lights.
 Mint increases brain activity and improves memory, so chewing gum and sucking on mint candies can help you increase your alertness and improve the quality of your work.Keep a stash close to your desk and dip into it whenever you feel yourself slowing down.
Drinking mint tea is also a great way to get some added caffeine.

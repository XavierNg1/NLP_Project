 Zinc is often overused in denture adhesives. If you have a diet that is high in zinc and/or take vitamins containing zinc, and also use a denture powder containing the mineral, you can experience serious health problems, including nerve damage.Look for powders that are specifically marked asa being zinc-free.


If you use a powder adhesive that contains zinc, only use it as directed on the label and do not use too much adhesive. Your prosthodontist may also be able to recommend a powder denture adhesive that does not contain zinc.
 Use your usual denture cleanser to give your dentures a good clean before you apply the adhesive.Keep your dentures moist and do not dry them off. The moisture will help the powder adhesive stick to your dentures.
 The key is to distribute the powder in an even layer over your dentures. Shake or vibrate the dentures in your hand to ensure the powder gets on both dentures. Think of this as similar to flouring a cake pan., Use your thumb and forefinger to press the upper and lower dentures into your mouth.Powder adhesives may not make your dentures stay in your mouth as long as paste adhesives. Usually, adhesives are more effective on your upper dentures than on your lower dentures. Liquids and foods can loosen your lower denture, so you may want to consider using a paste adhesive for your lower denture.

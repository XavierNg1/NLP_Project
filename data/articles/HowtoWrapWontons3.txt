 This method makes a wonton that looks like a sack of money or an old-fashioned coin purse. To begin, touch the tip of your index finger to the tip of your thumb to make a small ring (this should look like the "A-OK" hand gesture). Lay your wrapper on top of this ring, centered over the hole. It's not a problem if it droops slightly into the hole.
 Next, take about a teaspoon of filling (as before) and place it in a ball in the center of the wrapper. Use the spoon you used to scoop your filling to push the filling down through the ring made by your fingers slightly. This should draw the corners of the wrapper inward.


Don't push too hard! You don't want to end up with your filling, wrapper, or both on the floor.
 As you push the filling down, gently bring the edges of the wrapper together by closing the ring made by your fingers. As you do this, the edges of the wrapper should close together above the filling. When you finish bringing the edges of the wrapper together, your wonton should look like a tiny "sack" of filling with its upper edges ruffled up.
 The last thing you want your wonton to do is to come apart while you cook it. To ensure your wonton holds together, dab a little warm water around the opening of the wonton and press the edges together to seal. Because the edges are crumpled up, you may need to re-apply water as needed if you have trouble getting the opening to stay shut.


Congratulations! You're done. Lather, rinse, repeat, and enjoy your delicious wontons.

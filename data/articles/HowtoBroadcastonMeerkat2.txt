 Locate the app on your iOS device and tap on it. The app logo has a picture of a meerkat on yellow background.
 If you’ve used the app before, you won’t need to log in again. Otherwise, tap the “Log in with Twitter” button on the welcome screen.


You will be taken to your dashboard. All the live videos from the people you follow and from the Meerkat community will be displayed on your screen. Each of the videos has a preview snapshot and the broadcaster’s name.
 At the top of the list of live videos is a section for you to stream your own live video. Type something on the open field. This is the tweet that will go with your video. You can put your tags here.
 Your video will begin streaming and all the people on Meerkat and your followers on Twitter will be able to see it. You’re now broadcasting live.
 Tap the stop button on the lower right corner to end your stream. A confirmation message will appear; tap “Yes” and you will see a summary screen for your stream.
 Meerkat records your video so that you can share it later. On the summary screen, tap the “Save this Stream” button to do so. The video will be stored in your device’s media gallery.
 This will take you back to the list of live videos.
 This is the tweet that will go with your recorded video. You can put your tags here.
 Tap the “Schedule” button right under your tweet, and a window will appear where you can set a later time when your video will be shared. Swipe up and down to set the time.
 Tap the section right under the time setting to add the video you want to share. Access your device’s media gallery and tap on the video you saved.
 No further action needed. When the schedule time arrives, Meerkat will post your tweet and the video that goes with it.

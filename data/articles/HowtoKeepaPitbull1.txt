 Pitbulls are high energy dogs, which mean they need a lot of food. Choosing the food with the proper ingredients is equally as important as making sure your dog gets enough food. The better nutrition your Pitbull has, the happier they’ll be.Ask your vet what food is best for your Pitbull.
Consult your local pet food and supply store to see if they have any recommendations.;
, Pitbulls are very energetic breeds that need a lot of exercise, especially in their younger years. Going on regular runs or long walks will help them burn off their large amounts of energy.


If you already have an exercise routine, try moving it outdoors so your dog can join.
Go until they are tired. Remember, a tired dog is a happy dog.
 Playing fetch is a great way to exercise your Pitbull until they are out of energy. Fetch also provides mental stimulation and often engages a dog’s sense of smell.


Play fetch with a frisbee, tennis ball, or dog toy.
Try and play fetch with an object that is harder to find to challenge your dog’s problem solving skills., Pitbulls are not a “hands off” breed and need a lot of attention and a lot of sustained activity. If your dog is left home alone, chances are they will get bored and may start exhibiting behavioral issues.If you anticipate being away from home for an extended period of time, ask a friend to stop by every few hours to check on the dog and play with them.
If you work a fulltime job that requires you to be away from home, a Pitbull might not be the breed for you.
If you happen to live in a house or apartment too small for a dog make regular weekly appointments with a canine daycare service while you’re away.

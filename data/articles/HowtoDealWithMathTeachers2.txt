 Students are often so stressed out that they get distracted by their own reaction rather than dealing with the problem in front of them. Stay focused on the problems, not your reaction to them.


Take a deep breath. Even though math can be hard, taking a minute to gain perspective is important. Math class is not a life or death affair.Be prepared for class. The best way to be relaxed for class and during exams is knowing the material. Always do your homework and be ready to discuss that day’s material. Be honest about what you know and what you don’t. There’s no reason to pretend you know what you don’t. That only makes you more stressed out.
 Procrastination can cause a lot of problems in math classes. Always give yourself plenty of time to do your work. Don’t wait until the last minute. Do your homework as soon as you can after class.
Doing your work right after class means that the concepts are still fresh in you mind. This way you don’t have to review what you covered in class in order to do your homework.
Procrastination can cause you to fall behind in class. Since math classes usually build on the last lesson, it’s easy to get lost if you do not keep up with the work.
 Try to eliminate as many distractions as possible when trying to focus. Make sure your phone is out of reach. It’s tempting for many students to spend time on their phones rather than pay attention in class. Put your phone away during class or when you’re working on material for class.
Close out all windows on your computer if you’re working on math homework. You may want to check social media accounts or browse the Internet. Instead, don’t tempt yourself. If possible, try disconnecting from the Internet entirely.
Study in a quiet location. You don’t want to be distracted by outside noises. Find a place that’s comfortable for you, but will also encourage you to stay on task.

 Not getting enough sleep can affect your concentration and cause memory problems, hindering your learning process. A healthy sleep schedule should be kept up as lost sleep has a cumulative effect on your mind and body. As a general rule, the required amount of sleep for optimal functioning is:9-11 hours a day for children
8.5-9.5 hours a day for teenagers
7-9 hours a day for adults

, As a general rule, eating healthy will improve your overall well-being, both mentally and physically. Improve your capacity to learn by consuming healthy, “smart” foods that aid with concentration. Make sure to eat a well-balanced breakfast every day, avoid high fat foods, and try to add learning-friendly foods to your diet, such as:Omega 3-rich fish (e.g. salmon)
Whole grains
Avocados
Blueberries
Dark chocolate

, Regular exercise is a key component to concentration and learning potential. If possible, exercise right before studying, which will raise your focus for 2-3 hours. If your concentration starts to fade while reading or studying, take a 15 minute exercise break to renew your energy (e.g. a quick walk around the block).Exercise also releases endorphins and serotonin, which boost mood and fight depression.
 Get the best learning experience possible by keeping an open line of communication with your teachers. Reaching out will let a teacher know that you appreciate their time and wisdom, and that you should be taken seriously. Ask questions at appropriate times (e.g. after class), visit during office hours, and follow-up by email to confirm that you have absorbed what they told you., Setting clear goals for your learning process will keep you motivated and organized. Be realistic about your goals in terms of time and complexity. For instance, if you want to learn the theoretical component of how to drive, aim to read and retain one chapter of the driving manual per week.

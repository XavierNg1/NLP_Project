Desert eagle way: If you use a dessert eagle lay into him unless on veteran. Then aim for the head and stop him enough to fall back to a better weapon.
Barret 50.caliber way: If you are using a Barrett .50 caliber shoot him far away 4 times.
Grenade launcher way: Have 2 loaded grenade launchers. Hit him with one swift weapon to the other and hit him. After using shells stay on 2nd weapon.
M240 way: This only works on regular or below just completely shoot at him
C4 way: C4 the ground before he comes.;
, A shield will dodge any damage a juggernaut throws at you or any mishaps

, Intervention or Barrett 50. Cal with full ammo work best

, The closer you get to an armed juggernaut, the more damage you get and make to sure to be ready to attack!

, A juggernaut wears a suit that is built for high damage, but we all know that the head is the weak part of a human. Shoot all rounds in the head of the juggernaut.

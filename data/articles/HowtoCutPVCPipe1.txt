 The most basic and most widely used tool in cutting pipe, PVC or otherwise, would be the hacksaw. It's still important to secure the PVC in place using a vise, to avoid letting it slip around and risk cutting yourself with a glancing swipe of the blade. Be extremely careful and take the necessary precautions in clamping the pipe into the place.


You could also use another type of work clamp to just secure the pipe into place on your workbench, rather than using a vise. Use what's available.
Clamp it a few inches away from the cut to give yourself ample clearance. If possible, you can clamp on both sides of your cut, but having one clamp a few inches from intended cut line will make it plenty secure.;
, Use a permanent marker to clearly indicate where on the pipe you're going to cut. Don't worry about whether or not the ink will stay on, you can wipe it off later with some rubbing alcohol if you're feeling cosmetic.
 Place the hacksaw onto the mark and hold the handle firmly, then use your other hand to push down on the top of the saw, seating the teeth into the pipe. You want to start in the right place, and doing this will help to ensure that you don't start off with some raggedy swipes of the saw.
 Start sawing, keeping sure to watch closely as you cut and donâ€™t let the saw drift from the mark that you made originally. Saw fast enough to keep the cut going, but not so fast the teeth jump over the cut your'e making. You should be able to cut through PVC relatively quickly.

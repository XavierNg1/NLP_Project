 Most regions don't have access to YouTube's offline viewing feature. This means you'll need to use a third-party app to download videos for later viewing.
 These apps are not technically allowed by YouTube, and will often get pulled from the app stores. New apps will always rise to take their place, so apps listed here likely won't be around for long. Most video downloader apps work very similarly, so the process should generally be the same. Search for "video downloader" and read the reviews for the available apps. As of October 6th, 2015, the most popular downloader app that works with YouTube is "Video Pro Movie Downloader."

, When you launch Video Pro Movie Downloader, you'll be greeted with a browser that loads the YouTube mobile site.
 Search YouTube for the video that you want to download for later viewing. Tap the video to open the video's page on the YouTube mobile site.
 Once you load the video, you'll be prompted to download it. Tap "Download" to begin downloading the video file to your device.
 After you start downloading the video, tap "Done" in the upper-left corner to return to the main Video Pro Movie Downloader screen.
 If the video hasn't finished downloading, it will appear in the "Downloads" tab.
 This will allow you to easily access the video from your Photos or Videos apps.
 Once you've saved a video, you can watch it from your Camera Roll at any time, even without an internet connection.

 Outlook 2010 has a new feature that helps sort the messages by dates and arrange them in Conversation.


When using this feature, the messages which have the same theme will appear as Conversation and the users can view, expand or shrink them by clicking on the icon to the left of the Subject line. The messages inside each Conversation are classified with the newest message placed on top. When a new message is received, all Conversation will move to the top of the email list that helps you track easily the flow of the emails.
To activate the Conversation, in the View tab of the Conversation group, tick the box Show As Conversation. You can reduce the size of a Conversation with the Clean Up feature. This feature will help to remove the duplicate messages in the Conversation.
On the Home tab in the Delete group, click Clean Up then click on Clean Up Conversation. In all versions of Outlook, the users can find the messages in the mailbox folder faster by changing the way they are classified in the email folder. For example you can sort out your emails by date, sender and file size or importance level.;
, The mental energy required to shift focus between ever-changing topics drains you, not the volume. You tend to read in sequential order either chronologically or by "most important person." This is a brain burnout. Use this rule instead; it applies to email from direct reports and works better than conversation chains.


Identify the top 2-5 projects you are most concerned with; create subject headings to reflect these.
Let the team know you will pay initial attention to all those emails with these standard subject headings. These subjects are your top priority projects at the moment––your email will be sorted by subject line and top priority are read/responded to first.
Make it clear that inappropriately titled emails will blacklist the offending sender for 1-x days.

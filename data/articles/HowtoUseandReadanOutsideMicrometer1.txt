 Some parts are stationary while others are movable.

, Use either a clean sheet of paper or soft cloth, and hold it between the anvil and the spindle. Gently twist and close on the sheet or cloth. Slowly, pull out the sheet or the cloth.This practice isn't a necessary step for measuring, but keeping the surfaces of the anvil and spindle clean ensures precise measurements.
 The anvil is stationary and can withstand more pressure than the spindle. Make sure the object doesn't move or scratch the surface of the anvil.
 The frame will rest gently on your palm.


You can also fasten the frame on a stationary vise; this helps free up both hands for the measuring process.
 Be sure the 0 on the thimble is lined up with the scale on the sleeve.
 Apply enough force. The thimble often clicks. Three clicks is a good stopping point.
 Even though it is on lock, the spindle can still be moved.
 Be sure to avoid scratching either surfaces of the anvil or spindle; the slightest scratch can ruin the micrometers measuring accuracy.
 If the spindle loosens, be sure to remeasure.

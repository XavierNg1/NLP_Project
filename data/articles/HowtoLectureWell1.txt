 Your audience will learn more effectively if the information presented is organized around key themes, allowing them to relate smaller details to bigger ideas.


These themes should represent the main educational content of the lecture: what you want the audience to learn in addition to whatever smaller details you provide.;
,


These might be passages from a text, historical examples, selected data from a report, etc. Choose examples which you can explain fully in a few minutes and which will help your audience to grasp the subject matter.



In contrast to the 1 to 3 key points, this will be a question that you want your listeners to consider further, a problem for further analysis, or a thesis or proof that explains the information you have given earlier. Such a conclusion will help your audience retain the other details you include in your lecture.
 Consider something that will grab the audience's attention, such as an anecdote or surprising fact.
 These will allow you to organize your thoughts in a coherent manner that will be easier to listen to than a scattering of thoughts.


Do not write out your lecture, as this will lead you to read from your notes and have poor delivery; instead, provide general topic headings and a few key details or sentences that you want to include.
You should be able to speak freely off of this outline without pausing to review your notes. If there are specific facts you want your audience to retain, be sure to highlight these.
,


Examples might include a slideshow, props, a sample of music, or a few images displayed on a board or screen.
 Make note of whiteboards, lighting, and other tools so that you do not seem unprepared or flustered when your lecture begins.
 Speak more slowly than you think you need to and aim to finish at least a few minutes before the lecture is scheduled to end so that your lecture can survive delays and distractions.

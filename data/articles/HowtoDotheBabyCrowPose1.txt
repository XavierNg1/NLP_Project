 Before you do the baby crow pose, go through some warm up poses. This helps prepare your body for the more difficult pose. Start with a cow pose. Get on your hands and knees with your back flat. Your arms and legs should be perpendicular to the ground. Raise your head and look ahead.Inhale and tilt your head back. As you do this, raise your tailbone and push down your abdomen. You are creating a dip with middle section.;
, Cow poses are usually followed by cat poses, which is why sometimes they are merged together and called cat-cow poses. From cow pose, exhale and lower your chin to your chest. As you do this, raise your back towards the ceiling as you tuck your tailbone under.This is the opposite of cow pose with your middle arching upwards instead of down.
Go back and forth between cow and cat poses around four to five times.
 The dolphin pose is the downward dog position but on your forearms instead of your hands. Start on your hands and knees. Inhale and tuck your toes under, and then exhale to lift yourself onto your feet. Press the sitting bones towards the ceiling. To transition into dolphin pose, lower your elbows and forearms to the floor. Your forearms should rest parallel on the floor.To complete these push-ups, inhale, look ahead, and lift the heels. Exhale as you lower yourself and tap the chin to the floor.
Do this move five times.

 If you want to make your outdoor dog into an indoor dog, you shouldn’t just bring them inside and expect them to stay. You have to introduce them to being indoors slowly because they’ve lived their lives outdoors up until this point.Try bringing the dog inside using a leash or just leading them inside. Let them stay inside for a few minutes, then take them back outside. You can slowly let them stay in for longer periods of time.;
, If your dog is resistant or nervous about coming inside, use positive reinforcement. Connect being inside with treats and praise. Put treats in the doorway or lay down a line of treats to entice your dog inside.Once inside, give them another treat and lots of praise and love to help them learn that being inside the house is a good place.
 Another way you can help encourage your dog to come inside the house is to use their feeding time. You can use the feeding time to slowly bring them inside and help them get used to the new environment.Feed the dog on a mat outside. Once they get used to eating on the mat, place the mat just inside the door. If your dog won’t go to the bowl, put a leash on them and bring them inside so they can eat. As the dog gets more comfortable, move the mat further and further inside the house.

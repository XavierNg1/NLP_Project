 Sometimes an interviewer will ask you a question that is entirely unrelated to your industry or to the job that you're applying for. This is usually to see how you handle pressure and how you will react to the situation. The most important thing is to stay calm and to act like the question doesn't phase you.Hiring managers want to see if you will become flustered or frustrated by the question.
 If you can, try to answer the question by thinking of a situation in your life that relates to it. For example, the hiring managers at Mastercard ask employees "What do you do if you are approached by an employee who is complaining about a colleague who has horrible body odor?" You could answer by saying something like "Well, I actually had this issue in Highschool, and I was the smelly kid. The kids actually got me more interested in different sprays and colognes while we were in the locker room, and it helped me a lot. So I'd probably do something like that.", Sometimes these questions are aimed to see what kind of person you'd be like to work with. For that reason, when given a strange or curveball question, just try to answer truthfully without coming off as disrespectful.


For example, Whole Foods Market hiring managers ask "Would you rather fight 1 horse-sized duck, or 100 duck-sized horses?" You could say something like, "A horse-sized duck would be terrifying and horrifying. I'd definitely go with the 100 duck-sized horses."

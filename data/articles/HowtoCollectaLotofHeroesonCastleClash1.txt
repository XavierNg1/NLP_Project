 Make sure it's red now, and says Warehouse mode. This way, you'll have more space in the warehouse so you can fit more heroes.;
, If you are planning to roll over thousands of gems, earn gems first. Usually, the best way to roll is if you buy gems, usually the last gem offer which give you the moo\st. Earn or buy at least 10000-20000 gems to roll.
 This is usually the best way to get good heroes since you can sometimes get 3 good heroes at once, and it had better accuracy. Tap Enter on your hero's altar and tap the gems option.
 This will cost 150 gems and will also give you 1 hero at a time, which isn't very effective. Tap 3x 450 gems to get 3 heroes at once. These are more likely to give you legendary heroes, which are very powerful.
 Open all the cards you have gotten. Be sure that there is enough space in your hero's altar so you can fit more heroes.
 Ordinary and elite heroes can be helpful, but some elite heroes are slow and they have to actually go right to the enemy to attack instead of attacking from far distances. Sell those if you'd like. Keep all legendaries you get, except if they are a bad hero, such as a Paladin. You should also keep Gelatinous Champion essences so you can use them for skill talents. Slime and Crystal Ooze is good as well.


A Paladin is some kind of knight hero, but it is not very effective. It's more like an elite hero, one that ha to go to the attacker completely and attack with something face-to-face. They are also not as powerful as other heroes, even though it's a high level.
Gelatinous Champion is a kind of essence that gives 3000 skill talent points. If you have a lot, you can use them to upgrade your heroes HP attack. An HP attack is when a hero gains enough energy (you see how much energy they have in a purple bar while attacking), then they use their special skill.

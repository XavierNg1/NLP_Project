 An Ash bed of 1-2 inches should always be maintained, this helps protect the floor of the firebox and will also assist in catching embers and radiating heat.


Excess ash in the base of your fireplace can pile up and hamper any new material from being able to burn quickly and properly.
Excess ash can also be a potential health hazard.
 If the fire seems to die out, use a long stick or a fire poker to move the logs around. You should also blow on them to provide a burst of oxygen. Keep working on the fire until it seems to be stable again, if you neglect it, it will go out.Use your poker to keep your coals together. Red, hot charcoal burns hot and will provide enough heat to quickly light tinder, kindling, and softwood. Coals will get hotter and hotter as you accumulate them with the fire poker/stick and retain plenty of heat for a long time.
As the wood burns down to charcoal, make the charcoal glow red by poking and blowing air onto it. Then add on some more tinder, kindling and firewood.
 Sometimes, when burning a fire in your fireplace at home, parts of your logs may not get hot enough to catch fire. To Keep your fire burning longer, frequently add more kindling and tinder before adding logs to create more flames and heat, helping your logs burn.


If you have an elevated grate in your fireplace, place your kindling and tinder under the grate so that the flames can raise up beneath the logs.
If you don’t have space under your logs, stuff the material in between the logs with a poker.
 Place new logs on your fire so that there is still space for the fire to breathe. You don’t want to smother what fire you have.Larger hardwood logs are great for sustaining an already burning fire. If the fire is hot enough, the hardwood logs won’t take too long to start burning.
If your fire is dying out, mix some softwood logs in as well to quickly draw a larger flame.

 Be aware that not all hospitals allow VBACS after cesarean.


Some hospitals will only allow VBAC if there was no more than one cesarean performed prior, and some others will only allow VBAC if approval is given by the resident obstetrician at the hospital.
Contact the hospital directly and find out exactly what is allowed and what is not.
 One of the most effective ways to detect fetal distress that can occur during a VBAC is by monitoring fetal heart rate during labor. Although most hospitals and birthing centers do have this equipment, some do not.



The main risk associated with VBAC, though rare, is a uterine rupture. #*During a uterine rupture, the force of the contractions causes the previous cesarean scar to rupture. If this happens, it can be a life-threatening emergency for both mother and baby. For this reason, it is imperative that you give birth in a facility that can handle emergencies.

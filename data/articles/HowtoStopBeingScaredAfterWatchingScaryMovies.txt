 It's supposed to scare you, and remember that it's just a trick; it's not real! You're no less safe than you were before. Keep in mind that all the scary things you just viewed were most likely computer effects or something similar. Remind yourself that it is not real.;
, Like 50 First Dates, or The Wedding Planner, or some chick-flick! Try comedies as well- they will make you laugh and lift your mood.
 Just keep remembering those are live actors and actresses, and nothing horrid can or did really happen, try to imagine the director suddenly yelling cut! Then then actor/actress taking off their mask and saying "What the heck. What now?" It helps you to realize that it is all just made up.
,, Hang out with a friend, or be around family.
 Try to point out how it is impossible, and if the scary things did exist, why would they target you in particular?

, Each time, make the scene less scary. For example, maybe the killer just jumped out of nowhere and killed someone. Think of when the killer stabbed the person. Next time, make them be poking them with a stick, next time they can be cat fighting etc. Each time just make it funnier. Pretty soon it will be hilarious! You won't be scared at all. Do this with each scary scene that has left you scared. Next time you watch the movie, you may be laughing your head off while everyone else is shaking in fear!

, You will find that seeing how the movie was made will take a lot away from its scariness.
 "Oh yeah, talk to the creepy stranger in a trench coat wearing a black hat- he'll be so nice!"

, It is another attempt to give the movie scarier realism.
 It'll remind you that it's all in your head.
 Why would it happen now? Why would zombies suddenly exist just after you watched a zombie movies and not before? And why would the zombies or monster just so happen to be in your town?

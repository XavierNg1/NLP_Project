 Try to model love to everyone. Obviously it is simply impossible to truly feel love toward everyone - but don't snob someone just because you don't particularly like them. Phi Mu's are known to be kind and humble, so just put on that beautiful smile of yours, hold your head high and keep on walking. (If you have to, clench your teeth together and force on a smile so you won't look rude)-but try not to look fake about it.;
, You are obviously a well rounded GREAT girl if you are a Phi Mu, so take advantage of that!! Don't be conceited or self-centered but take compliments gracefully and feel good about yourself. Having self confidence is a key ingredient to living a fabulous life!

, Lying is ugly-and not appealing. If people hear you lying, they will never feel they can fully trust you...because they will assume you could be lying to them too!

, It can be appropriate to have a few drinks, but not too many. Know how much your body can handle and stop before you lose any sense of control. Being a loud, obnoxious drunk girl is not cute, not appealing, and NOT classy!

, ESPECIALLY if you are sporting that PHI MU jersey! Be proud of your letters, but remember, in pjs or Prada, you're representing Phi Mu. (And your letters should never be worn in an inappropriate place like across your rear - definitely NOT classy).
 There is nothing sweeter than a polite, considerate person.
"- WEAR PEARLS with your dresses!!!!!!!! That is so classy and fabulous looking!!

, Take a few minutes out of your day to just do something nice for someone! You have no idea how much of an impact you could make on someone's life if you just take the time to go out of your way for them. Helping people not only makes them feel great - it also makes you feel worthy, and good about yourself!!

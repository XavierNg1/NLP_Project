 Cleaning vegetables is a wonderful task for small children. Ask the child to help scrub ingredients like potatoes, carrots, or squash. Give the toddler a vegetable scrubber and tell them to gently scrub the vegetables to help remove the dirt.Make sure the vegetable scrubber is safe for children. A soft, nylon brush works well.;
, Another fun, easy kitchen task for small children is tearing up greens like lettuce or kale. Ask the toddler if they want to help you make a salad. Then demonstrate how to tear the large leaves into smaller pieces.Make sure your toddler washes their hands before handling greens, especially if they will be eaten raw.
 While it might seem questionable to hand a knife to a toddler, allowing a child to chop food with a kid-friendly knife can help them assert independence. Try giving your toddler a plastic, child-safe knife. Hold the food with your hands to stabilize it. Then ask them to chop soft items, like bananas or squash, with the knife.Try giving the child a butter knife or plastic knife designed specifically for children.
Never give a toddler a sharp or serrated knife.
Always supervise children with knives, even if they are child-safe.
 If you are making a dish that requires you to weigh ingredients, involve your toddler in the process. Let the child spoon ingredients on to the scale. This will help them become involved in the cooking process.

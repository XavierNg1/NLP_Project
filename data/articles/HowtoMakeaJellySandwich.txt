It's the exact same materials you need to make a classic P&J (just without the peanut butter): one to two slices of bread, flavor jelly of choice, a butter knife to spread the jelly, and a plate and napkin to eat it once it's done.
Place the bread on the plate. One piece will make a quicker, smaller sandwich, while two pieces will make a larger, more filling one.;
,

Most kinds of jelly come in a jar. In order to open it, grab the lid and twist. For other kinds that may come in a bottle, you just flip open the lid and squeeze out your jelly.
At this point you need to place the jelly on the bread. If it's in a jar, you may need to use the butter knife to get it out. Just leave it in a little heap in the center of the bread for now, making sure you have a good jelly to bread ratio.


Using the butter knife, spread the jelly as evenly as possible over each slice of bread. It doesn't have to be perfect, but you don't want too much jelly all in one bite. Try to spread outwards from the center of the bread for the best results.
This step can sometimes get a bit messy. If you get any jelly on your hands or on the crust of the bread, you can wipe it up with your napkin.


If you are making your jelly sandwich with two slices of bread, place one of the pieces of bread on top of the other, making the sides with jelly meet. Try to align the crusts of the bread so that no jelly leaks out.
If you are making your jelly sandwich with one piece of bread, you can finish it off in two ways.

The first is to break the bread in half, then place one half on top of the other so that the sides with jelly meet. You want to align the two halves just like above. This method words best with harder bread.
The second is to fold the bread in half, aligning the sides with the jelly. This method works best with softer bread, as harder bread may crumble when folded.


The only thing left to do is enjoy your edible masterpiece!

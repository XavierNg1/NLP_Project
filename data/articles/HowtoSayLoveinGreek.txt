 Ancient Greeks defined several distinct types of love, including sexual passion. platonic comradeship, empathy, unconditional love, and playful love. These distinctions are still important in modern Greek.Agape: αγάπη or "ah-gah-pay" describes unconditional human love. In modern Greek, you might use it to describe how you feel about a friend, a lover, a relative, a child, or a whole group of people.This word is generally safe to use in most contexts.

Eros: ἔρως, pronounced "eros," is the Ancient Greek term for intimate love or romantic love. The word can be used to describe romantic passion as well as the act of sex itself. When there is sexual love involved, you should always use eros instead of agape.


Storge: στοργή, pronounced "store-gay," describes familial love or "natural love." You might use this word to describe the affection that you feel for your daughter, your brother, or your grandparent.

Philia: φιλία, or "fill-ee-ah," refers to brotherly love and camaraderie. Traditionally, it's used to describe friendship and bonds formed through shared experience.;
, In most cases, stick to the phrase Σ΄αγαπώ, which generally means "I love you."Pronounce it "say ah-gah-pó," "Ce agapo," or "Se agapó."Use it in any context except for sexual love, for which you should use the word eros.


The "I" conjugation of the Greek verb for "love" is αγαπώ, pronounced "ah-gah-po." The modifier σε, pronounced "se," means "you."
For a more formal expression of love, use Σας αγαπώ, pronounced "Sas aghapó."

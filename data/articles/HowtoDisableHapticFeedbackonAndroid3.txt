 Locate your device’s Messaging app, and tap on it.
 Tap the + icon, or the New Message button, usually at the top of the screen to create a new message. This will make the on-screen keyboard pop up.
 This is usually next to the Spacebar. Tapping the gear icon will open the keyboard settings.
 The look of the menu will depend on the keyboard of your choice. Typically, the menu will be something along the lines of “Sound and Vibration.” Tap the Sound and Vibration menu, and then tap the “Keypress vibration” checkbox to remove the checkmark. This will disable keyboard haptic feedback.

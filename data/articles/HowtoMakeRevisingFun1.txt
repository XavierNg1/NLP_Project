 It is always important to make a revision timetable so you are organised. Get information from your school teacher on the subject exams that you will be taking. Aim to begin revising well ahead of the actual exam dates; that way you will have less stress about the whole thing and can afford to let yourself take a more graceful pace to your revising.;
, This reduces the decision-making involved and creates comfortable routine for you, saving that extra decision-making space for learning and relaxing later.
 Choose software that allows you to colour code your timetable. This is a whole lot more fun than dull black and white with the occasional greys. For example, Microsoft Excel will let you color code the revision timetable in a digital format.


If you're not using a digital timetable, use highlights and stickers on your paper timetable.
 It is important to include relaxing time as well as revision time. The relaxing times matter; they give you distance from what you're learning, allowing your brain to process everything properly, at a gentler pace.

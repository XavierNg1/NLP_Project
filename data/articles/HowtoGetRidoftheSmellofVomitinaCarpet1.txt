 Try not to allow excess water to ooze into other areas of the carpet, as this may spread the stain and make it hard to vacuum all the water out of the carpet.


Needless to say, remove any, err, solid bits that may be left over. And if you need an article about getting rid of vomit stains, try How to Clean Vomit out of Carpet. We'll be concentrating on the stench for now.;
, If you're worried about your carpet, you can dilute it with a little bit of water. A bit of peroxide is another possible additive, but only if your carpet is white -- you don't want to risk making the stain worse.


The smell may seem like it's getting stronger at first. This is only because it's getting wet, rising to the surface, and escaping. Don't freak out yet!

, If you don't have a vacuum, soak up the liquid with a dry towel. A wet-vac will be much more efficient, but a towel can work -- it just may take an hour or two sitting on the stain for the towel to absorb everything.
 Brush it in gently, lifting the soap to the top if any has become entrenched in the fibers. This step may have to be repeated several times to remove the soap from the carpet fiber.


If soap does get left in the carpet, it could harden and lead to slight discoloration. So while this step seems harmless, not doing so may prevent your carpet from returning to good-as-new.
 Don't jump to any conclusions yet -- you don't know what the carpet will be like until it's completely dry. So if the stain or smells persist, give it a bit of time and then try some alternate methods. It may just be a waiting game.
 Why settle for no smells when you can have good smells? Spray some Febreze over the area if you'd like, to seal the deal.

 Eat nutritious foods throughout the day to keep your blood sugars balanced and your digestive system working smoothly.


Avoid simple sugars, caffeine, and high-fat foods, and instead focus on complex carbs, lean proteins, good fats, and fresh herbs to stimulate the hormone serotonin, which promotes sleep.Stop eating at least three hours before you plan to go to bed. Eating too close to bedtime may cause acid reflux or other gastrointestinal issues, which will negatively affect your sleep quality and make it harder to wake up., Exercise burns calories and strengthens your cardiovascular system to help ease the stress that might keep you awake, and it will also expend any excess energy so that your body can relax.Afternoon exercise sessions may be best, as the workout raises your body temperature, which then falls back to normal, which may lead to better sleep.Adjust your planned wake-up time, if necessary, to add an exercise routine in the morning.
 Verify that you’ve set the time to the correct period of the day (AM or PM) and that your volume, snooze actions, and power supply are in place.


If you’re using a sound-based alarm, consider placing your clock at some distance from your bed so that you have to get up to turn it off.
If your alarm requires mental exercises, such as puzzles, place your clock near a light source so that you can see it more clearly, if necessary.
 Using your sleep evaluation, choose a bedtime that’s appropriate for the sleep you need, and take the time to prepare your body for rest.


Consider relaxing or stress-relief habits before sleep, such as meditation, prayer, or relaxation techniques.Make sure your mattress, pillows, and blankets are comfortable, and go through any before-bed rituals, like brushing your teeth and washing your face. Make your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet (or have some sort of white noise).

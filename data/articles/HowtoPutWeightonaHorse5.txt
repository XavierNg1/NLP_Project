 'Dr Green' aka grass is best! During the winter months, you could feed your Seniors beet pulp and rolled barley as it is easily digested and easier to chew. You could feed hay as a bulk, but give haylage for one meal every second day. You can now buy Senior mix from your co-op, which is specifically designed for the older horse.

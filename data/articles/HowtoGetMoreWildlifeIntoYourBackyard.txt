 One of the most important additions to your garden is water. All living creatures need water in some form or another. Here in the Midwest we are blessed with natural sources of water such as rivers, lakes and ponds. In residential areas, however, sources of clean water are rare. Birds and other "critters" will flock to bird baths and ornamental ponds.;
, Birds are afraid of drowning and will readily drink from shallow baths while standing on stones.
 Use a mild bleach solution to scrub the bird bath if it gets dirty. Rinse thoroughly and refill. Use an electrical element designed for this purpose to keep the bird bath functional during cold winter months. The birds will flock in large numbers when most water is iced over.
 Add rocks and pebbles so that the birds and animals will approach to drink and bathe.
 A simple, lo-tech drip system involves more labor but almost no cost. Take an old gallon milk jug and poke a tiny pin-hole near the bottom and another air hole near the top. Suspend it from a tree branch or shepherd's hook so that the slow drip falls into the bird bath. Refill as needed.
 Search the internet for a list of local native plants and add a few each year, or divide with friends, until you have a thriving native garden.
 Native butterflies are endangered in many areas due to loss of habitat. We all know that bees are similarly threatened. Anything we can do to add native flowers to migration routes and habitats will give the butterflies and bees a boost of nutritious nectar along the way.

 Functions are usually stated as f(x) = relationship, where x is the variable input, and the relationship is stated as a formula for the variable x. Since you are adding or subtracting more than one function, they will be labeled differently, most likely f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} and g(x){\displaystyle g(x)}.

For example, you might be asked to add the function f(x)=3x+2{\displaystyle f(x)=3x+2}, and the function g(x)=4−5x{\displaystyle g(x)=4-5x}.

If you are being asked to add, you will often be asked to find (f+g)x{\displaystyle (f+g)x}.

If you are being asked to subtract, you will often be asked to find (f−g)x{\displaystyle (f-g)x}.

, This means ordering the formula by exponents, beginning with the largest exponent (x3,x2,x,{\displaystyle x^{3},x^{2},x,} etc.). If there is no exponent, order the first-degree term first (x), followed the constants (numbers without variables).

For example, the function g(x){\displaystyle g(x)} would be reordered as −5x+4{\displaystyle -5x+4}. The f(x) function is already ordered by degree of terms.
 You can add/subtract horizontally or vertically, since you have ordered the functions by terms.

For example, your function can be set up as (f+g)x=(3x+2)+(−5x+4){\displaystyle (f+g)x=(3x+2)+(-5x+4)}, or it could be set up vertically, with like terms lined up:+3x+2−5x+4{\displaystyle +{\begin{matrix}3x&+&2\\-5x&+&4\end{matrix}}}.
 It is helpful to add/subtract in order of the degree of terms, beginning with the highest exponent (if any). For example, for (f+g)x=(3x+2)+(−5x+4){\displaystyle (f+g)x=(3x+2)+(-5x+4)}, you would first add the first-degree terms:3x+(−5x)=−2x{\displaystyle 3x+(-5x)=-2x}.Second, you would add the constants:2+4=6{\displaystyle 2+4=6}.So (f+g)x=−2x+6{\displaystyle (f+g)x=-2x+6}.
 Adding or subtracting functions is always just a matter of adding/subtracting the like terms in the relationship formulas.

 Fill a tea kettle with 1 cup (250 ml) or so of water and set it on your stove. Heat it on high until the water begins to boil.


Water is the most common option used with this method, but you can experiment with other liquids for a more flavorful alternative. Grape juice enhances the raisins with their natural flavor, but other fruit juices, like orange juice or apple juice, can add greater depth and complexity. Alcohol, like wine or rum, could also be used.
Instead of a traditional kettle, you could heat the water with an electric kettle or small saucepan, if preferred.
 Place the raisins in a small bowl and pour the boiling water on top, making sure that the dried fruit remains fully submerged.
, Remove the raisins using a slotted spoon or pour them through a small colander to separate them from the liquid.


It might be a wise idea to drain the excess liquid from the surface of the raisins by spreading them out onto clean paper towels. Gently pat them dry with additional paper towels to dry them even more thoroughly, if desired.
 The raisins should be plump, juicy, and soft at this point. You can eat them like this or use them in a recipe that would benefit from plumped raisins.

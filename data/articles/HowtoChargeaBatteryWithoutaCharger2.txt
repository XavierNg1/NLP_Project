 Hold it in your hands.
 Continue to do this for 30 seconds to several minutes.









Note: Your battery is not being recharged. Some internet commentators have suggested the rubbing the battery provides it with additional charge, perhaps from built up static electricity.This interpretation is entirely incorrect.
Lithium ion cells, like all genuine batteries, release electricity as a consequence of chemical reactions. As predicted by the Arrhenius equation, these reactions become more powerful as temperatures increase.Essentially, you are improving the conductivity of the battery by raising its temperature.
 You may only have a few moments of battery life, so make the most of them.

 If you are starting work with a new employer, try asking your contacts there what to expect when it comes to dress code. Your contact should be able to tell you exactly what to wear. Don't be afraid to ask those you know at your new company for help when deciding what clothes you need to select.


You can ask during an interview.;
, If you are unsure of what to wear, do some research on-line to learn more. Look up similar companies and industries and try to learn what their representatives are wearing. Researching what other companies require for their dress-code can give you a better idea of what you can expect for your own position.
 If you aren't sure what the current trends in men's fashion are, you can try reading over some men's fashion magazines or on-line style guides. These magazines and guides can help get you up to date and give you a better idea of what businessmen are wearing today.
 If you aren't sure what would look good or where to start, visit a tailor or men's clothing store. The professional staff will help you make choices that look good and are specifically selected with your own needs in mind. Look for some men's suit stores or tailors near you and ask the staff what they think would work best for you.
 If you can't get any idea of what you should wear to work on your first day as a businessman, overdress. It's better to overdress than to under dress, which may look too casual. Always overdress if you aren't sure what you need to wear.

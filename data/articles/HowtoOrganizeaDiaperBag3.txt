 At the end of the day, replace any diapers that you use during the day with new ones so the bag is always stocked. Put in a new packet of diaper wipes if you are running low. Try to get into the habit of replacing any items in the diaper bag that you use throughout the day.
 For hot summer days, add seasonal items like sunscreen and a hat for the baby. For chillier fall days, have an extra sweater or blanket in the bag for the baby. Add items to the diaper bag that you might need based on the weather., As your baby gets older, they may need different items. For example, older babies may need different clothing or different toys. Toddlers still in diapers may need a different type of diaper or different snacks. Update the bag as needed to keep up with the needs of your child.

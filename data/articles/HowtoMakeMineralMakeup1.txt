 These will create the base color for your foundation. Here is what you will need:8 teaspoons titanium dioxide
1 tablespoon sericite mica
4 teaspoons zinc oxide
1 teaspoon magnesium stearate;
, There are two undertones for skin: warm and cool. Adding oxides to your base will give you just that: warm and cool undertones. Don't worry if this doesn't match your skin tone just yet, however; you will be adjusting it further later on. Here's what you should start with:¾ to 1 teaspoon yellow iron oxide
⅛ teaspoon brown iron oxide
1 small pinch red iron oxide

, Place a fine sieve over a clean bowl, and pour the powder through it. Use the back of a metal spoon to help press the powder through the sieve. Next, place the sieve back over your original bowl, and pour the powder through it again. Do this 2 to 3 more times.
 The foundation you have just made would give you a basic skin color, but it there are hundreds of different skin tones, and each one is unique. Adjust the foundation using the suggestions below:If you need it to be lighter, add more titanium dioxide.
If you need it to be darker, add more brown iron oxide.
If you need it to be more pink, add more red oxide.
If you need it to be more yellow, add more yellow oxide.
If the foundation is too sheer, add more zinc oxide. Be careful, however; too much zinc oxide will make your foundation look dull.
 These will help hold your foundation together as well as make it more nourishing for your skin., This will ensure that the oils are evenly mixed into the powder. It will also help break up any clumps.
 At this point, your loose powder foundation is done. If you want it to be pressed, like compact makeup, you will need to add some 99% isopropyl alcohol . Here's what you need to do:Stir in enough 99% isopropyl alcohol to make a paste.
Smooth the paste down into a clean, empty compact.
Press it down with a coin wrapped in clean, cotton fabric.
Leave the compact open overnight, or until the powder dries.

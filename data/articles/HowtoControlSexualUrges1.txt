 Try to step away from any environment where you feel it's difficult to control your urges. If you are at home and feeling a compulsion to masturbate, for example, try taking a quick walk to the store. If you can’t leave your current environment (if you’re at work, for example), try talking to another coworker or taking a break.


It might also be helpful to have someone to help keep you accountable, such as a trusted friend or even a therapist.;
, Write down all the tasks, errands, or things around the house you need to do today. If you are feeling the need to engage in a compulsive behavior, look at your list and distract yourself with another activity.


If you think it is unlikely that you will be able to do something productive when you experience a strong sexual urge, then try to keep an easy distraction on hand, such as a good book or a puzzle you can work on.
 Putting off the compulsive behavior makes you think about your behavior before committing to it. It also helps you tolerate uncomfortable feelings and distress.Set a time goal for yourself. Try telling yourself, “I’ll watch porn in an hour,” or whatever the largest amount of time you can commit to postponing may be. You may only be comfortable postponing your behavior for one minute. That’s okay, give yourself one minute.
After your allotted time is up, you can choose to postpone again, or engage in your behavior. But choose to postpone whenever possible, even if it is just another minute.
After a while, you may be able to extend the amount of time you go without feeling the need to engage in the behavior.
 Making a list of all the risks or negative consequences associated with the behavior may help to stave off sexual urges as well. Write down all of the risks and potential consequences of acting on your behavior. Carry the list with you at all times and review it when you experience a sexual urge.

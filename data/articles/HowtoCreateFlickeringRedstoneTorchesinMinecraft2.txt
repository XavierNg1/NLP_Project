 For your redstone torch to flicker, it must be mounted on a wall, rather than planted on the floor. Find the spot where you want your final flickering torch to be. Note that the torch must be mounted on the highest block of the wall - for the "flicker" to work, it can't be any lower.


Also note that because it's necessary to lay redstone dust on top of the block the torch is on, you'll want unimpeded access to the top of the wall.
 Equip your redstone torch and mount it on the top block of the wall. To be clear, you must mount it on the side of the top block in the wall, not on the very top of the wall.
 Lay one redstone dust on top of the block with the redstone torch on it. This should cause your torch (and the dust) to begin to flash on and off.
 If the redstone dust on top of your wall ruins the aesthetic of your structure, you may want to hide the dust by concealing in the construction of your wall. Use any sort of block you wish to conceal the redstone dust. Note, however, that, if you're creating a building, you may need to work these blocks into the plans for your ceiling..

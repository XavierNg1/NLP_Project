 This is the green icon with a white speech balloon on your Home Screen.


If you find yourself in a conversation that you don't want to edit Read Receipts for, tap the back button in the upper-left corner of the screen.
, This is the blue "i" icon in a circle.
 This will be in the second set of menu options below your contact's name. The switch will turn white when it's off, and your iPhone will stop sending read receipts to this contact.


If you don't see the Send Read Receipts button here, that means your contact does not have an iPhone, or is not using iMessage.
If Send Read Receipts is already in off position, then Read Receipts are already disabled for this contact.
Your other contacts will still receive read receipts from you if you have Send Read Receipts turned on in your Messages settings.

 Create a solution made with half water, half white vinegar. If your item is detachable, such as a shower head, make enough solution to completely soak the item. Use a container that will fit in the microwave to save time., Stir the solution well. Dip a cotton swab into the solution. Apply the cotton swab to a hard-to-see area of your nickel product. Let it sit for 30 minutes.If no visible damage occurred to your brushed nickel finish, you can proceed to cleaning the entire item with the vinegar solution.
 Heat the solution in a microwave, using a microwave-safe container. Alternately, you can heat the solution in a large saucepan on the stovetop. Heat the solution only until it’s warm, not hot or boiling., If the nickel piece is small enough, dunk it directly into the solution and allow it to sit for 30 minutes. If the nickel piece cannot be removed or is too large, pour the solution into a spray bottle and douse the brushed nickel with it. Allow the solution to sit on the surface of the metal for 30 minutes., Remove the item from the solution, if applicable. Try wiping the mineral deposits off with a rag. If that doesn’t work, use soaked cotton wool or a toothbrush to clean the deposits.If your item is a shower nozzle, use a paperclip to unclog the jet holes.
If there are still mineral deposits remaining, repeat the diluted vinegar application once more., Don’t leave vinegar sitting on the product’s surface. Use a bucket of water or a rag wet with water to thoroughly rinse the brushed nickel. Buff dry with a soft cloth to avoid water stains.

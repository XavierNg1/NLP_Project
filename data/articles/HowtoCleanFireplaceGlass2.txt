 This method only works for wood-burning fireplaces since it requires the leftover ash from the fuel source, which gas fireplaces do not leave behind. Open the glass doors to access the sooty glass.
 You can use plain water if you wish, but adding the white vinegar helps break down the sooty carbon residue.Adding the mix to a spray bottle will make it easier to apply, and the mixture makes a good cleaner for other household surfaces as well.
 You don’t need to soak the towel or the cloth. Simply dampen it with the solution.
 Find a spot of fine ash in the fireplace and dip the cloth in it to get a light layer over the damp portion.Ensure that you only pick up the fine ash and not anything larger on the towel. Anything more abrasive than the fine ash can scratch the glass.
 The fine ash makes the perfect slightly abrasive material to scour the carbon residue on the glass. Scrub in small circles, but don’t worry about scrubbing too hard. You will likely have to apply more of the solution and dip the towel back into more ash several times as you go.


The soot and ash will work into a paste as you scrub along each section of glass. This is how you can tell when you’re adding enough of the solution and ash.
If any large pieces of residue are stuck to the glass and won’t budge, use a razor blade to break it down to something the paste can manage.Be very careful to contact the residue but not the glass with the razor blade. Otherwise, you risk scratching the glass.
 Once you have scrubbed the soot off all portions of the glass, wipe away the ash/solution scouring paste. You can use another paper towel to wipe it away.
 With the sooty paste wiped away, you can use the warm and vinegar solution and clean paper towels or a microfiber cloth to finish bringing the glass to a sparkle.

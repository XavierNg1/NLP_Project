 If you do not plan on breeding your mini Schnauzer, then you should have your dog spayed or neutered. Spaying and neutering will prevent your dog from getting another dog pregnant or from becoming pregnant herself. Spaying and neutering your dog also offers some health and behavioral benefits for your dog.Spayed female dogs are less likely to get certain kinds of cancer and infections.
Entire (not spayed or neutered) male and female dogs are more likely to roam and engage in hormonal behaviors, such as aggression. By spaying or neutering your dog, you can prevent these behaviors., Your mini Schnauzer should always wear an ID tag and collar. This will make it easier for people to get her home to you if she ever gets out of your yard and gets lost.


You may also want to have your Miniature Schnauzer implanted with a microchip. A microchip will ensure that your dog can be identified if she loses her collar. This is a requirement in some cases, such as for international travel., You will be responsible for your miniature Schnauzerâ€™s veterinary care as soon as you take her home. This breed needs regular veterinary visits to ensure good health. Keep your dog up to date on her vaccines. At veterinary visits, your miniature schnauzer may need:


Lyme disease vaccination
Kennel Cough vaccination
Rabies vaccination
Heartworm prevention medicine
Spay or neuter operation
Vaccine boosters...depending on where you and your dog live.
 Miniature Schnauzers are more prone to eye diseases and vision problems than some other dog breeds.If you notice that your miniature Schnauzer seems to be having trouble seeing (bumping into things, walking more slowly than usual, etc.) or that her eyes look cloudy, runny, or otherwise unhealthy, then take her to see the veterinarian right away.

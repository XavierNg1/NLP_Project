 Start with a 2-to-1 olive oil to red wine or cider vinegar as your base. Then add your favorites spices, or even a specialty ingredient, such as crushed up kalamata olives. Not only is the easiest and cheapest way to supply yourself with a low-cal dressing option, you can also craft a dressing with flavor of your own choosing, Vinaigrettes are great because they’re especially healthy, and go well on almost any salad. Make one to have on hand in your kitchen. Start with ½ cup of olive oil and a ¼ cup of either red wine vinegar or cider vinegar. Add 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of Dijon mustard, 2 cloves of pressed garlic, 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce, and 2-3 teaspoons of lemon juice. Finish with a bit of salt and pepper.Shake the ingredients altogether and store in a glass container with a tight, resealable lid.
 If you’re absolutely hooked on creamy dressings, consider making one at home. There is even a secret ingredient to help keep calories down while still getting some creaminess: silken tofu. Use it to make a dressing similar to “Green Goddess”, but with less fat and calories.Mix 6oz of lite, firm silken tofu, ¼ cup water, 1½ tablespoons cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) lemon juice, 2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) tahini, 2 chopped green onions (just the green parts), 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of chopped parsley, a clove of garlic and a bit of salt and sesame oil in a blender. Simply blend until you get your desired consistency. This one is vegan, too!
If you’re feeling especially indulgent, you can also make healthier versions of ranch or caesar dressings at home by using low-fat yogurt, as opposed to mayo or some of the other unhealthy ingredients commonly used in creamy dressings.

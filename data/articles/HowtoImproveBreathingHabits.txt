, As you inhale, feel your core pressing out on each palm and relax the perineum (the pelvic floor). Don’t tense any muscles to do so, just let the air push the diaphragm down and expand the lower torso. As you exhale, don’t push the air out. Gradually relax and let the air flow out, drawing the walls of the lower torso in with it. Once this begins to feel natural you can relax the arms and breathe with the use of the palms.
 Inhale for a slow count of four, exhale for a slow count of four.
 There is no limit to how far you can work the breath as long as you are inhaling and exhaling smoothly without pause. Play this breathing pattern for anywhere from five to thirty minutes.

 The best tactic to control black spot is to plant roses in locations that benefit the rose and thwart the fungus.


Roses should get 6-8 hours of sunlight daily. Morning sunshine is best: it quickly dries out nighttime dew.
Growing locations should get plenty of air circulation. Space rose bushes far enough apart to allow for good circulation and prune out some center branches to allow internal air circulation.
Prepare the soil well. Ensure that it is rich in broken-down organic matter and that it drains well. Well-rotted compost is a good soil enhancer.
 Excess moisture encourages black spot, so it's important to water with care and to not over-water rose plants. When it's cooler, water weekly with a deep soak at the base. For hot, dry weather, more frequent watering will be required, without wetting the leaves.


Use soaker hoses or drip irrigation at the roots of roses for more frequent watering.
Take care when watering––black spot spores get moved about by splashing water. Using soaker hoses or drip irrigation is always better than using hoses with spray watering devices.
Water roses only in the morning so that the leaves can dry out by nightfall.
 Remove any weak or damaged branches and leaves as part of regular pruning.

 Find out at what time your mailman comes; they usually come at a certain time range, so watch for a few days and keep track of the time.


If your mailman comes when you are at school, try it on a Saturday. On Saturdays your mailman may come at a different time from when they do on weekdays.;
, Around 5-10 minutes before the mailman comes, place the letter in the mailbox while your parents will not notice you. Place the flag up.


If you need an excuse, say "I am going to check the mail".

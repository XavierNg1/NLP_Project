 This mounting plate can be made of any sturdy material that can withstand the vibration of the gasoline engine. The 3 main power pieces (engine, generator head and alternator) must be mounted so that their shafts are parallel and the shaft attachment areas for drive pulleys are in the same plane. Mounting holes and mounting hole patterns must be derived from the manufacturer data for each of the 3 major power pieces.
 A pulley must be mounted to the engine shaft to belt drive the pulleys that will come already installed on the generator head and the alternator. This pulley size must be chosen so that when the engine is rotating at the nominal running speed given by the manufacturer, the belts will scale this up or down to the pulleys of the generator head and the alternator. Choose the scaling so that the generator head and the alternator are running at the rated speed indicated on the manufacturer data sheet. In most typical generators, this will result in an engine pulley of 5 to 10 inches (125 to 250 mm). Pulleys are available at industrial supply stores and through equipment supplier catalogs.
 The design of the generator may need different pulleys on the engine to apply proper shaft speed to the generator head and the alternator, or this may be workable with 1 engine pulley and 1 belt. Run the belt over the pulleys and make sure that they are taught. Slotting the mounting holes of the engine will provide good adjustment to achieve this. A V belt is preferable to a standard belt as it will have less tendency to slip. Belts may be acquired from the outlet that supplied the pulleys.

 You can connect your drive through USB, Firewire, or Thunderbolt. Depending on whether or not it is formatted already, your drive may appear on the desktop. You can ignore it for the moment.
 You can get to the Disk Utility in the Utilities folder under Applications.
 You can see a list of your connected drives in the left frame of Disk Utility. Click the drive.
 From the Format menu, select “Mac OS Extended (Journaled)”. Enter a name for the drive. You can change this name at any time.


If you want to use the drive on both Mac and Windows machines, select ExFAT.
 A window will open asking you to confirm. After confirmation, the format process will begin. The time it will take is dependent on the size of your drive. Larger drives take longer to format.

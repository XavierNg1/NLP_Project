 Animals are not known for their cooperation in such matters. When they get bored, they leave and there is not much you can do about it most of the time.;
, For dogs, you will probably want something on the floor, but if they are comfortable with it, a bed can work. Cats can pretty much be everywhere.
 You will want some light modifiers, like reflectors, diffusers, and maybe even filters.
 Most of the time, that is what people want and what sells.


Having said that, nothing can beat the cuteness of a puppy, or dog, looking at you sheepishly from a large mud puddle. Always be ready to get a picture.
 Rarely can you get much cooperation from your 'client' without some type of assistance.
 If at all possible, try to have those subjects be about the same color and reflectiveness.

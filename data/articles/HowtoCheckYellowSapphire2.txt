 On a small scale, natural yellow sapphires can be cut into nearly any style. Once stones get larger than one carat, however, many jewelers tend to prefer cutting sapphires into oval or cushion mixed cut. Since round and emerald cuts are more popular, however, jewelers often cut synthetic stones into round and emerald shapes. Natural sapphires can, in theory, be cut into the same shapes, but it is much less likely.
 Manufacturers of synthetic stones often place an "X" cut, also called a scissors cut, on the facets of a stone.
 Occasionally, the facets of synthetic stones do not come out as crisp as the facets of a natural sapphire would. This flaw looks very similar to the grooves one might expect to see on a vinyl record, but they can usually be seen only under magnification of a 10x loupe.
 A good synthetic may have flaws that are only visible under 10x to 30x magnification. Low, 10x magnification can usually identify the curved, grooved banding found in synthetic sapphires, especially when the examiner places a piece of translucent glass in between the stone and the light source. Higher 30x magnification can identify gas bubbles and masses of powder that has not melted.]

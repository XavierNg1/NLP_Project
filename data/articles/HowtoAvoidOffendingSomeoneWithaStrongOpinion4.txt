 If you know someone to have a strong opinion about a particular subject, it may be best to avoid the topic. You can avoid a topic by simply not bringing it up, or politely excusing yourself if someone else broaches the subject.You might find a sudden urge to use the restroom or need to take a call outside.


If you've only just met a person but suspect he or she is highly opinionated consider avoiding religion and politics.Both subjects are highly controversial, so it's a pretty good bet the person has strong opinions about one or both.
 If you find yourself in a conversation with someone who feels very strongly about the topic, treat his or her beliefs respectfully. It's okay to question the beliefs and opinions of others. Discussing controversial topics can actually make the involved parties more similar to each other, causing small changes in one another's thinking.However, using strong language or sarcasm, can further polarize both parties. Ask questions about why the person feels the way he or she does and about alternatives to his or her opinion.


Avoid making offensive or generally negative statements, like "it would be stupid to…" or "only an idiot would…" These kinds of statements are sure to incite someone with who obviously feels differently than you do.
 You might start with a brief apology for interrupting and then make a statement or ask a question about an unrelated topic.


Flattery is a great way to decrease the intensity of a person discussing a topic passionately. Try saying "I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I just noticed your shoes are fantastic. Where did you get them?"

 This is an important part of picking out the bushes and plants. Native species are much more likely to survive, because they have gotten used to extreme conditions. They are also ones that would not be foreign to the birds.;
, Having food for the birds is essential. Berries are a great natural way to supply them with food. They will eat the berries, and will always have a source of food nearby.
 A variety of sizes is a great way to create a beautiful environment. The birds will probably nest in the bigger bushes. So, if you want even more birds, you might get many big and full bushes. If you are attracting birds near your house, you may want to put the smaller plants toward your home.
 When you are buying plants, buy different kinds. You should always have at least one with thorns. Birds are more apt to nest in a thorny plant. You can also buy different types of trees, such as evergreens. Evergreens will act as a shelter for the birds in difficult conditions.
 When you plant the chosen plants, think about the best places to put each of them. You might want to plant several of one species next to each other. Planting evergreens close together is a good idea, because it will provide more shelter. Also, think about what you think would look nice. You will like this attraction more if it looks good to you.
 Remember to plant each species of plant the way it is supposed to be planted. If you are given instructions by an expert, follow them. Be sure not to plant them too high or deep in the ground. If you plant a species the incorrect way, it may die.

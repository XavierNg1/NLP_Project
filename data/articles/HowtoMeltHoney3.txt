 Spoon some honey into a small jar or dish. Add fresh water to the honey, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time, mixing after each addition. Continue until the honey reaches your desired consistency.No heat is required for this method.






Since you aren't actually melting the honey in this process, you cannot use this method to decrystallize hardened honey.
In addition to thinning out the honey, water will also dilute the taste.
The exact amount of water you need will depend on how thin you want the honey to be and how strong you want the flavor to remain. Typically, though, you will not want to exceed a ratio of equal parts honey to water., While undiluted honey is best stored at room temperature, a honey syrup like this is best stored in the refrigerator. This thinned out honey will only last for about three weeks, though.


After three weeks pass, the honey will start to lose its flavor and may show signs of crystallizing.
Store this thin honey syrup in an airtight container to prevent moisture loss.

 You can do this using an electric mixer or even a spatula. Make sure that everything is evenly combined., Keep beating until the mixture turns dough-like. It will feel hard and dry at first, but it will soften after about 1 to 2 minutes. If it is still too hard, add in 1 tablespoon of milk and mix again., At this point, you can also add in some food coloring. You can use liquid or gel good coloring, but you might find more success with gel.You don't need much; only a few drops should be plenty. Keep kneading the dough until all the ingredients come together, and the dough is silky-smooth., The balls should be small—roughly the size of marbles. You will only need about ½ teaspoon to make each mint., Fill a shallow dish with granulated or confectioners' sugar. Gently roll the balls one by one in the sugar before placing them back onto the wax paper., You can do this with your fingertip, the back of a spoon, a fork, etc. Don't flatten the balls so much that they are flat like a pancake. If you are using a mint mold, simply push the ball into the mold, smooth down the back, and pop it out., If you are in a hurry, you can also leave them to harden in the fridge or freezer; this will only take about 2 hours., These mints are based on cream cheese, so they will go bad if they are left out at room temperature for too long. You might also want to place a sheet of parchment paper between each layer of mint candy; this will prevent the candies from sticking together.

 Similar to no-sew curtains, you need to decide how much of the window you want covered and then give an extra allowance for the hem.


Allow six inches of extra fabric at the top of the curtains to create the loop for the curtain rod.
Sewing a hem requires less extra fabric to fold over than an iron-on hem, so feel free to reduce the folded edge to only a few centimeters, at least two minimum though.
 You need to create a distinct fold for the hem to make it easier to sew. Pin the hem in place with straight pins.
 You can hand stitch or use a sewing machine, but the latter will take significantly less time. Sew along the hem that you just ironed, removing the pins as you go.
 Follow the same rules as above by ironing along the hem and removing pins as you go.
 Measure the tape to match the width of the curtains, and iron onto the top of the panel. This will stiffen the top edge, making it sturdier for hanging.
 If your curtain rod is larger, adjust this by adding more fabric for the loop.
 Make sure the loop is even all the way across, or else it will not allow the curtain rod to go through or will drape unevenly.
 Take down the curtain and turn up a double hem to the marked length and press.


To make a neat finish at the lower corners, open out the folds at the sides (unpick the side hem you've already sewn), and the hem.
Fold in the corner at an angle, then carefully refold all the turnings to make a 'mitered corner'. Hand-sew the hem and the miter (you can use the machine if you’re in a hurry).
 Slide the rod through the loop you’ve created, and drape the curtains to match your taste. Enjoy your newly made curtains!

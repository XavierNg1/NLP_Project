 Most of the components needed to make the hand sanitizer are common household products, so it’s quite possible that you already have most of them. The ingredients you need are 80 proof or higher grain alcohol (vodka), plain aloe vera gel, and essential oil(s) of your choice (optional).To be comparable to store-bought products like Purell or Germ-X in terms of effectiveness, the final product needs to be at least 65% alcohol.Using 80 proof vodka (or higher) will place your final product within that range.The essential oils you choose are completely up to you. Lavender, lemon, peppermint, geranium, cinnamon, tea tree and rosemary are common choices.You can use more than one if you like but the total amount of essential oil you use should not exceed 10 drops.
Aloe vera gel also comes in a variety of purity options. You’ll want the purest that you can find – simply check out the label to get the purity information., You’ll need a clean bowl, a spatula (or spoon), a funnel and a recycled liquid soap or hand sanitizer bottle.If you don’t have an empty bottle on hand to upcycle, you can use any kind of container you want, as long as it has a lid.
 Measure out 1 ounce of vodka and 3 ounces of plain aloe vera gel and dump both of them together in to the bowl.Add ten drops of your chosen essential oil(s). Use your spatula (or spoon) to stir vigorously until the ingredients are fully mixed together.


If you’d prefer not to mix by hand in a bowl, you can use your food processor instead.
 Use the funnel to pour the mixture directly from the bowl into the bottle you’ve chosen to use. Replace the pump, lid or cap on your bottle. Now you have your finished product and its ready-to-use immediately!


Use the mixture within one month. Store it out of direct sunlight.

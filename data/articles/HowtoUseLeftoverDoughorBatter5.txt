 You will need the following: Leftover cookie dough.
A small pizza pan or cake pan.
Toppings such as chocolate sauce, M&Ms, and peanuts.
 You should do this on a floured surface. Make sure your rolling pin has been coated in flour or your dough will stick to it.
If your dough is sticky or wet, like chocolate chip cookie dough, you can also press the dough into your greased cake pan or pizza pan.
It should be about 1/2 inch thick.
 This is typically the temperature used for baking cookies.Bake the cookie pizza for 8 to 10 minutes.
Check the dough often, because you will want to catch it when it is just turning golden brown.
Take it out of the oven.
 You can get creative with what you use, but be sure it is something that can go into the oven.You can use chocolate sauce, caramel, nuts, M&Ms candy etc. to top your dessert pizza.
After you have added your toppings, return the pizza to the oven.
Bake another 2-3 minutes, then remove from oven.
Serve plain, or with ice cream.

 Lightly stroke your partner's neck with the tips of your fingers. This will begin to turn on your partner and may even make her shiver with pleasure. Stroke the area that you plan to kiss and your partner will feel even more pleasure when you kiss her there.;
, One of the most sensitive parts of the neck is the where the neck connects with the shoulder and collarbone. Another sensitive part of the neck is the front left or right side. But almost any part of the neck is sensitive and susceptible to your kisses.


Use your body as you kiss your partner's neck. Don't just stand apart from your partner and lean in to kiss her neck. Instead, wrap your arms around her if you're facing her, or wrap your arms around her from behind if you're kissing her from behind.

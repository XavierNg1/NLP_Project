 Examples include ketchup, mustard, salt, pepper, utensils and paper napkins.
 For example, if the bottle of ketchup is overly large you could pour ketchup in a red bottle with a nozzle for ease of use.


If containers are not obvious as to what they are, create a labeling system or decorate the bottles with pictures of the item (for example, paste a picture of a ketchup bottle on the ketchup container).
 For example, condiments like ketchup and mustard can be located on one side and then you could even wrap place settings/utensils inside paper napkins.

, The best way to do this is by hand, or perhaps by using an old (cleaned) comb that you wouldn't mind getting dirty. Use the comb to separate the pumpkin seeds from the fibrous, fleshy parts.
 Those fleshy bits that are still attached to the pumpkin? Some people like to leave them on, preferring the flavor they give the final product. If you don't want those fleshy bits on the outer pumpkin shells, here's how to try to remove them:









Soak the seeds in water for a few hours, then strain the seeds in small batches into a mesh strainer. With your hands, stir the pumpkin seeds around in the mesh strainer and let the mesh catch the remaining pulp. When you slide the seeds out of the strainer, they should be pretty clean.
 Although no seasoning is necessary, this would be the time to season your pumpkin seeds:









Season with a little bit of curry powder, cayenne pepper, or chipotle flakes for a spicy, savory edge.
Season with a little bit of cinnamon, clove, or nutmeg for a sweet treat.
Season with regular old table salt or sea salt for added salty flavor.
 Allow to cool before eating!

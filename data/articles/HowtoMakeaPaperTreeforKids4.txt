 Grab 4 to 8 pages of newspaper.
 Start rolling the newspaper around a pencil; discard the pencil after a few rolls.
 When you are two inches from the edge, lay another newspaper on top of the flap and continue rolling again until about two inches remain again. Do not roll too tightly, you will see why later.
 Repeat step 3 until all pages are rolled up.
 Make four equal vertical cuts to one end of the tube, about 6" long (you can do this with scissors or by tearing).
 With your left hand holding the tube, gently use your right hand to pull upwards from the very center of the cut end. Stop when you reach the desired height. The paper tree will start to grow to eight to nine feet high.
 You can use green spray paint to color the tree if you want to.
 Using brown paper, wrap it around the base of the tree and tape or glue it in place.
 Once it's together, you can further build up the base with crunched up newspaper and paint it brown, if you want to create a stouter-looking tree (like a pineapple bush).

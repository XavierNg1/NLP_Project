 Try to wipe down your fixtures on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Performing a gentle wipe down will keep the dust from accumulating and creating a layer of grime. You can also dry the fixtures if you see any water spots present after a shower or bath.
 If you see a spot developing on your fixture, dip a cotton ball in a one-to-one vinegar and water mixture. Place the ball on the surface of the chrome and hold for a few minutes. Remove it and rinse with water. Repeat as necessary to remove any stains., Go to your local hardware or auto store and purchase a polish made especially for chrome. Follow the directions on the package and apply the mixture to your chrome fixtures. Make sure that you rinse the solution off thoroughly. If done properly, this will keep your fixtures shining between cleanings., This is a cleaning product that works by creating a barrier that repels water. Spray Rain-X directly onto your chrome fixtures and wipe away any excess. You can also moisten a microfiber cloth with Rain-X and apply it that way. With either method you should get at least a few weeks of protection from water drop spotting., Get a sheet of wax paper, fold it to expose the waxy side, and gently scrub the chrome. It may feel weird to polish a fixture with paper, but this really works. The wax will get lightly applied to the surface of your fixture and it will enhance the shine and help it to repel dust and dirt.

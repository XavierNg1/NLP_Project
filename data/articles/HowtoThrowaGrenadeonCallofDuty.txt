 In Modern Warfare, World at War, and Modern Warfare 2, there is a total difference in how the grenades throw. Some are lighter than others, and some have longer exploding times.;
, On Modern Warfare, you can throw the grenade the longest out of any of the three. The arc is also exceptionally accurate and length defining. So what you'll want to do with these grenades are to aim the crosshairs about midway up and cook it for about 3 seconds, and the exploding will follow a few seconds later.
 On World At War the grenades are pretty much the same, although they tend to fly for a little longer, making the distance further available. So for this ones you'll want to aim your guy's crosshairs a tad bit lower than you would on your guy's on Modern Warfare. But you will still want to cook it for the same 3 seconds.
 The grenades in Modern Warfare Two do not fly that far, and their arc is a tad more degreed. The grenades are the same type, but are heavier. So for this you'll want to aim exceptionally higher than regular, and optionally want to do a running start to get the maximum distance.

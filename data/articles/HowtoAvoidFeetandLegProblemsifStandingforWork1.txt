 Although many jobs in modern times are sedentary and involve sitting, there are still some jobs that involve lots of standing, such as bank teller, cashier, factory worker, chef, hairdresser and various retail and construction jobs, to name a few. However, there are often opportunities to sit and rest your feet while still working and being productive, so look for those opportunities and be sure to tell your boss what you're up to. For example, sitting while answering the phone or filling out paperwork might be appropriate at your workplace, especially if there are no customers around.


Aged people are more susceptible to foot/leg injuries from excessive standing because their tissues (ligaments, tendons, cartilage, fascia) lose elasticity and shock absorbency.;
, When you take your lunch break, make sure to grab a seat and put your feet up while eating and hydrating. You may be in a hurry, but take advantage of the opportunity to take the weight off your feet. If your workplace is short of chairs or doesn't have a lunch room, then either bring your own folding chair or stool, or find a different location to eat where you can safely sit down.


Food courts at malls, outdoor picnic tables, water fountains, or even some clean grass under a tree are all good places to take a load off and enjoy your lunch.
 Make sure to take all of your allotted breaks and try to sit the entire time, preferably with your legs up, which promotes better circulation because of the reduced effects of gravity. Taking off your shoes while resting will also allow your feet to cool down by evaporation.


While on your break, consider rolling your bare feet over a golf ball. It will feel great, relieve some tension in the soles of your feet and maybe even help prevent plantar fasciitis (pain and inflammation of the connective tissue covering the bottom of your feet).

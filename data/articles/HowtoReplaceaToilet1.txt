 Turn off the water at the supply valve. Flush the toilet to remove most of the water (holding down the flusher for as long as possible). Remove the remaining water from the bowl by forcing it down with a plunger and mopping up the remaining water with a sponge. Then, remove the remaining water in the tank with the sponge as well.;
, Disconnect the supply line using a wrench. You may want to take the opportunity to replace the line. If keeping the line, only disconnect it where it attaches to the toilet.
 Take the caps (they look a little like domes) off of the bolts at the base of the toilet, then remove those bolts. After that, remove the bolts connecting the tank to the seat.
 Straddling the bowl, place a hand on either side of the base of the tank and lift it off, rocking it side-to-side a little to ease it off and making sure to bend with your knees. Put it somewhere out of the way but be sure to put it somewhere water resistant, as there may be residual water.
 Now you can remove the rest of the toilet. Grab the toilet and rock it side-to-side to break the wax seal underneath and lift it off the bolts. If the bolts are badly rusted and the toilet is getting caught, you may need to cut off as much of the bolts as you can see using a hacksaw. Remove the toilet and put it somewhere out of the way.

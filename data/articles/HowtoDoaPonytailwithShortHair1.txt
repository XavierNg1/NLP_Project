 The middle section should have the most hair, and the two other sections should be equal. Put the middle section into a low ponytail. Leave the two other sections down for now., Pull on each side of the ponytail. This will squeeze the base of the ponytail, which creates volume at the crown of your head. You can use a comb to tease your hair more if it’s not voluminous enough., Pull the two other sections of your hair back towards the ponytail. Cover the elastic with the two sections. The elastic band should be hidden. Secure them with bobby pins at the base of the ponytail. Place the bobby pins vertically so that they are hidden, creating a polished look.The two other sections should be secured in a way that they make the ponytail look fuller. They should not appear separate from the ponytail.
 Use a hairbrush to tease the ends of your hair. This will contribute to a fuller looking ponytail by making it appear longer. You can use a teasing comb for extra volume if you’d like., Spray the ponytail with a hairspray that provides a strong hold. Secure the ponytail, but don’t use so much hairspray that your hair looses its natural bounce. Once you’re finished, you can push back your bangs or put on a headband.

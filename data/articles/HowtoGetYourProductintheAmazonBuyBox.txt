 Most sellers reprice, or adjust their prices, to keep their item featured. The prevalent practice is to price lower than all your competitors by one penny or some other fixed sum. But what many people don’t realize is that you can actually price your items higher and still win the Buy Box if you excel in other areas. An algorithmic re-pricer like Feedvisor should do the trick.;

  Seller rating is a crucial factor in winning the Buy Box. Sellers should aim for a seller rating of no less than 80%, ideally 90%. You can accomplish this by having outstanding customer service. You need to respond promptly and positively to comments and queries within 12-24 hours of them being left on your account page. Send satisfied customers a request to leave a positive review or a high feedback score.  If you still get left a negative feedback, message them privately and ask what you can do that would sway them to remove it. Worse comes to worst and a customer absolutely refuses to budge, leave a respectful comment on the feedback explaining to other readers that you offered to set things right., Items fulfilled by Amazon get a perfect rating for response time, delivery time, and other seller metrics. So FBA items have a much better chance of winning the Buy Box. If it makes sense for you to use FBA, do so.
 The Buy box does not go to sellers who run out of the item they are selling.  Make sure this doesn’t happen to you.
 The faster you can deliver the item, the more Amazon will favor your product. Similar to seller rating, moving up a bracket has a much greater impact on your odds than moving around within brackets. Thus, moving the expected delivery time from 8 days to 7 days will have a bigger influence than moving it from 7 days to 5 days. Brackets:• 0-2 days• 3-7 days• 8-13 days• 14 or more days.

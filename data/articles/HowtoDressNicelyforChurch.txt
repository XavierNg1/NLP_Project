, Make sure all of the items are presentable: clean, neat (ironed or pressed if appropriate), fit well, and in good condition. Wear these items with respect for their meaning in your religion or faith.
 Some places of worship require footwear to be removed, or men not to have headwear in place, so no socks with holes, dirty toes or bed heads (and even women should not wear baseball caps--as shown in image 2).
 A party dress or Hawaiian shirt is probably not appropriate, but the smart blouse or long sleeved shirt you last wore for a job interview could make an appearance at church.
 Church is a great place for women to wear dresses or skirts, but short skirts, low-cut tops, vest tops, etc., are some typically inappropriate garments. Also, be sparing with makeup and jewelry (natural and subdued, rather than gaudy and flashy).
 Churches and places of worship are not catwalks. The latest fashions are not required to praise your god.
 In summer, wear colours that make you think of summer flowers, do the same for the other seasons if you desire. This can be nice if your place of worship has floral arrangements as decorations. Your outfit will go with the flowers.
 Attending a worship service is about getting together with friends and family. Wear items of clothing that were gifts if they fit the occasion. Accessories are great for this. Your friend that bought you that smart tie or your aunt that gave you those smashing earrings will love to see you in them at church.
 You may all like to look good together when you worship or you may not care if you all clash color-wise and make an awesome orange, green and purple impact! The choice is yours. Beware though, a husband and wife attending church both dressed in white tops, beige pants and dark shoes may get one or two odd glances - only go "Bobbsey Twins" intentionally!

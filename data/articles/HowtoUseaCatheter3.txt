 Many people will be able to insert their own catheters, though it may take a bit of practice. Your physician will show you how to use a catheter so you can properly use one at home.Make sure to ask your doctor how often you should use your catheter.
Don’t be embarrassed to ask for help from a family member or professional caregiver. Needing help with catheters is common, and getting help to properly use one is very important.
 The area of the body where the catheter exits the body should be kept as clean as possible. You should wash this area with soap and water one to two times a day and after every bowel movement. This helps prevent possible complications, such as urinary tract infections., Always wash your hands before and after inserting a catheter. You want to keep everything as clean as possible to prevent the risk of infection., Catheters and any other supplies can be obtained at local medical supply stores once you get a prescription for a catheter. The other supplies needed may include towelettes for cleaning before and after, latex or non-latex gloves, and lubricants to make the process easier.Only use lubricants provided with the catheters, which are sterile and water based. Don’t try using other lubricants like mineral oil or petroleum jelly (Vaseline) because these can damage the catheter material, clog up the opening and make it less comfortable to remove, as well as increase risks of complications such as urinary tract infections.
 For both men and women, call your physician if you think you may have an infection, or if you experience a burning sensation, an unusual odor, painful catheterization, fever, chills, or fatigue. Also call your physician if you are leaking urine between catheterizations, are having difficulty or pain inserting the catheter, have any new symptoms, or have any sores.

 Glittery eyebrows are a major fashion trend right now. You can accomplish the look as long as you have a few specific tools. You will need an eyebrow brush, eyeshadow brush, a glitter base (or lash glue) and make-up grade glitter. Do not use glitter that is intended for crafts or other uses.Brush your brows into place with the brow brush. Next, use the shadow brush to completely cover your brows.
Dip the shadow brush into the glitter and press onto your eyebrow. Cover your brows with glitter.
Use the brow brush to comb through the glitter, making sure your entire brow is covered.
 Once you have a perfectly shadowed eye, it is time to apply the rest of your makeup. For extra pop, consider using an eyeliner with a glittery shimmer. This will enhance your look, even if you are not doing a cat eye or smoky eye.Use a lighter liner if you want to make the glitter eyeshadow the focal point. Use a dramatic black liner if you are going for more of a sultry look.
Using a glitter liner is a great way to experiment without committing to a full glittery eye.
 Your eyelashes are a great way to get creative with glitter. You can try a mascara that contains a little bit of sparkle. These products come in different colors, and have different amounts of glitter. Try swiping a coat on your lashes for some extra sparkle.If you want to ease into using glitter, apply one coat of your normal mascara. After allowing it to dry for 10 seconds, follow with a coat of glitter mascara.
Try pairing the glittery mascara with a sparkly lipstick. Your look will be festive and fun.

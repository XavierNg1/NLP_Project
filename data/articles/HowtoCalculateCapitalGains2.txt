  The cost basis is essentially what you originally paid for the asset.  For stocks and bonds, the purchase price can be adjusted up or down for stock splits, dividends, return of capital distributions and brokerage fees.  For example, if you purchased stock for $3,000 and you paid a $9 commission to a broker, your cost basis is $3,009.The cost basis is also referred to as “tax basis” or simply “basis.”


,  For stocks that you sold, you can find the selling price on the order of execution confirmation or your brokerage account statement.For other assets you sell, keep records of the selling price.  Make a copy of any receipts for sale of furniture, jewelry, coins or precious metals.  If you sold property, keep a copy of the closing statement from the settlement.
  The difference between the buying price and the selling price is your capital gain or loss.  The formula is Sale Price - Cost Basis = Capital Gain.   For example, suppose you purchased 100 shares of stock for $1 each for a total value of $100.  After three months, the stock price rises to $5 per share, making your investment worth $500.  If you sell the stock at this point, you will have made a profit of $400.You would pay capital gains tax on the $400 profit.

 Since you held the stock for a period of less than a year, it would be considered short-term capital gains and be taxed at your regular income tax rate.

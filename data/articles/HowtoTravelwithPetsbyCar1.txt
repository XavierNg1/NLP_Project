 Each pet owner has a unique pet that needs special care to be transported by car. If you know your pet needs special accommodations, make sure to include them when deciding to transport them by car.;
, If your pet is a mammal, they may need to be locked inside of an animal carrier. Reptiles and fish will require a suitable transportable container. It's important to make the carrying container as comfortable as possible, so that your pet isn't stressed during the trip.
 In general, avoid putting your pet in the front passenger seat––the sunlight coming from the front window may be harsh or may cause rapidly increased heat that may be unbearable for the pet. Moreover, the passenger airbag can have devastating consequences on any pet if it is released. If the model of car used doesn't have the capability of turning off the airbag, always keep your pet in the back.

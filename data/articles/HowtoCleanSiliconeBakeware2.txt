 For extra tough greasy stains, it can be beneficial to heat your silicone bakeware up in the oven before cleaning. Preheat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C). Once the oven is fully preheated, put the silicone bakeware into the oven for ten minutes. This will help heat up the food stains that are stuck on the bakeware and make them easier to clean.After you’ve heated up the bakeware, try washing it with grease-cutting dish soap and baking soda.
Be careful not to burn yourself while handling the bakeware when you remove it from the oven.
 Wet down your silicone bakeware in the sink and shake all the water off. You want the item to be damp, but not dripping wet. Identify the places where there are still greasy food stains and sprinkle some baking soda on each spot.Be sure to give a generous sprinkling of the baking soda, not just a light dusting.
 Gently massage the baking soda with a damp cloth so that the water helps the baking soda powder form into a thick paste. You want the baking soda paste to be applied heavily to each stain on your silicone bakeware.


Let the baking soda dry completely, which could take several hours.
 Once the baking soda is fully dried, rinse it off in the sink with hot water. If the stains have not dissipated at this point, you can try washing it with grease-cutting dish soap again or apply the baking soda again.


You may have to repeat this process quite a few times to get your silicone bakeware perfectly cleaned.
 Once you have finished removing the baking soda paste, use some dish soap to wash the silicone. Then rinse all of the soap off in the kitchen sink. You should place the silicone bakeware on a towel or a drying rack and let it fully dry before using the item again.


Be sure not to store your silicone bakeware in the cabinet while it is still wet, as this could lead to mold and bacteria forming on your kitchenware.

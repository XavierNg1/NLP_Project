 Wind each wick around a pencil and line wicks up in an even line.


Balance the pencil across the top of the container in order to keep wick in place.;
, Follow package directions for melting wax or consider placing wax pieces in a glass bowl and heat wax in a microwave for approximately 30 seconds.


Remove from microwave, stir and return to microwave for another 30 seconds until full melted.






Instead of melting wax completely down, stop heating when you have just a few pieces of solid wax. You can stir the wax until those pieces melt and the mixture is smooth (you donâ€™t want to burn the wax).
 Stir wax in between every few drops to fully integrate the oil into the wax.
 Avoid hitting the pencils if possible and fill wax to the top.
 This may take a few hours or overnight.

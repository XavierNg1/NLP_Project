 Metal needles are the classic type of needle and they come in many different sizes. Many knitters enjoy using metal needles because you can work quickly with them and because of the clicking sound they make while you are using them. However, if you are not concerned with knitting speed and/or find the clicking sound annoying, then metal needles might not be the best option for you.Most metal needles are made of aluminum, but you can also find metal needles that are made from nickel or brass.;
, Plastic needles are the most inexpensive knitting needle option, so this is a great choice if you are looking for a budget option or if you are just trying out knitting to see if you like it. You can also find plastic needles in extra-large sizes that other needles are not available in, so these may be a good option for knitting projects that require using a super bulky yarn or uncommon materials.Keep in mind that the yarn will easily slide off of plastic needles while you are working with it, which can be a bonus for speed knitting, or frustrating if you drop a stitch!

, Wooden needles are some of the most expensive, but many knitters prefer the feel of wooden needles.Wooden needles are also nice for beginner knitters because the stitches will not slide off of the needles as easily as with metal or plastic needles., If you like the feel of wooden needles but find them too expensive, then bamboo needles are a less expensive alternative to wooden needles.Bamboo needles offer knitters a similar feel to wooden needles and the texture of the needles helps the yarn to stay on the needles rather than slipping off them.

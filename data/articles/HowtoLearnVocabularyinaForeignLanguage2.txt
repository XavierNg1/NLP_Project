 Making things interesting and funny greatly increases the amount of vocabulary you retain. Get in the habit of coming up with memory aids, or mnemonic devices, for new vocabulary. Have fun--the sillier, the better! For instance: You can develop some devices based on sound. If you’re learning the word “mesa” (“table” in Spanish), say to yourself “Yolanda made a huge MESS all over the MESA.”
You can create other devices based on meaning. For instance, if you’re learning the word дом (dom or “home” in Russian), recognize that shares a root with the Latin word “domus” (“home”) and related English words. Think of a silly phrase like “Donald has a dozen DOMESTICATED dogs in his DOM.”

, Even if you can’t get super creative with all of the words and phrases you learn, it still helps to simply create a visual picture of what you are learning. This can be as simple as imagining the thing you are studying. If you’re learning “el pan” (“bread” in Spanish), picture a loaf sitting in a pan. If you’re learning “ir” (“to go”), picture a fast car going down the street., While it sounds like a complicated term, diglot weaving is actually a simple and fun way to learn new words. Simply replace a word in a sentence in your native language with the corresponding word in the foreign language. Since you can lean on your native language while learning foreign words, it’s great for beginners. Examples of diglot weaving include:”My friends and I split a pizza at the lunch Tisch” (when learning the German word “Tisch,” or “table”).
”Romeo told Juliet he’d lover her siempre” (when learning the Spanish word “siempre, or “always”).

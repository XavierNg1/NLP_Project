 A topic sentence states the paragraph’s main idea. It helps your reader recognize the topic of the paragraph and what they might expect to read in the paragraph. While advanced writers may not introduce the paragraph’s topic until the middle or end of the paragraph, it’s a good idea for those developing their writing skills to include a topic sentence at the paragraph’s beginning. If you are writing a paragraph on different breeds of dogs, you could begin with a topic sentence such as, “There are two hundred different breeds of dogs.”, Once you’ve introduced the content of a paragraph with a topic sentence, use the next two to three sentences to describe, analyze, and compare data, events, or quotations as they relate to the topic of your paragraph. Body sentences are where you will include and analyze any evidence you are presenting in your paragraph, or provide details about an event, person, or situation., After you’ve introduced the paragraph’s scope or argument in a topic sentence and analyzed or presented data and evidence in the body sentences, conclude with a concluding sentence. This is where you wrap up your ideas and major points before moving on to the next section of the email, paper, or letter you are composing.

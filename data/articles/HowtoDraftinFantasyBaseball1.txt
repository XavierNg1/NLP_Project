 With the explosion of interest in fantasy baseball, all the information you need is easy to find. Dozens of fantasy sites each employ a team of experts who specifically cover fantasy baseball issues, including who is injured, who is primed for a big season and who is the best player at each position. Magazines cover all of these topics but are generally a poor investment since they tend to become outdated quickly. Instead, bookmark the sites you find most reliable, and visit them daily for the most up-to-date information.;
, Fantasy baseball used to be fairly standard, but not any more. Between the use of unconventional statistical categories, a variety of scoring systems, and the prevalence of inning or game limits, it can be difficult to overlook a critical wrinkle that can have a significant impact on how you value the players you draft. Ask your league commissioner for the specifics regarding the scoring system, categories, and limits (if applicable).
 You donâ€™t want to be the one guy who forgets when or where the draft is being held and either show up late or miss it altogether. Online leagues will often send reminder emails the day before the draft is scheduled, but it is your responsibility to keep the draft specifics handy and ensure that you show up on time and ready to go.

 The process for viewing source code on Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer is the same.;
, It should be a page whose source code you wish to view.
 If you're using a Mac computer with a one-button mouse, you can hold down Control and click instead. If you are on a laptop with a trackpad, you can use two fingers to click the page instead. This will invoke a drop-down menu.


Don't right-click a link or a photo when doing this or else the wrong menu will appear.
 Doing so will display your browser's source code in a new window or at the bottom of the current window.


You'll see View page source for Chrome and Firefox, and View Source for Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.
You can also press Ctrl+U (PC) or ⌥ Option+⌘ Command+U (Mac) to display the source code.

 Whether raw or cooked, frozen eggs are best thawed overnight in a cold place like the refrigerator, to avoid being exposed to bacteria. Any temperature above 39ºF (4ºC) carries significant risk of bacterial contamination for thawing food.


You may speed up the thawing process safely by placing the container under cold running water.Never attempt to cook frozen eggs directly on a frying pan or in a dish. Do not leave frozen eggs to thaw at room temperature.
 Insufficiently cooking thawed eggs can carry risk of bacteria. The internal temperature of the thawed egg or the food it is mixed into should reach at least 160ºF (71ºC).Cook thoroughly at prolonged high temperatures if you do not have a food thermometer to check the exact temperature.
 If you have extra egg yolks, consider making a custard, ice cream, or scrambled eggs. Use up egg whites to make frosting, meringue, or white cake batter. Finally, hard boiled yolks can be crumbled on top of salads or used whole as a garnish.
 Use 3 tbsp (44 mL) thawed raw egg for each egg the recipe calls for. If the eggs were frozen separated, use 2 tbsp (30 mL) thawed raw egg white instead of the white of one egg, and 1 tbsp (15 mL) thawed raw egg yolk instead of one egg yolk.Egg sizes can vary greatly, so don't worry too much about the exact amount. If baking, you can adjust to a dry or wet dough by adding more wet or dry ingredients, respectively, to balance it out.

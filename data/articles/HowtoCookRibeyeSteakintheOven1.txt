, To sear a steak properly, the outside needs to be dry. Pat it off thoroughly with paper towels. The dry surface will lead to better cooking.In fact, you can salt the steak then leave it uncovered in the fridge overnight, which will slightly dry out the surface., Going from the refrigerator to the pan with a ribeye can lead to uneven cooking, particularly if you have a thick-cut ribeye. It's best to let it come to room temperature, which means leaving it out for at least 30 minutes before cooking., Once you've got it dried off properly, you can season the steak to your tastes. Many chefs recommend staying simple when it comes to a good cut of meat like a ribeye. Start off with salt and pepper, and go from there.

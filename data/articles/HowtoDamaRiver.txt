 Typically you can do this by digging/blasting out a series of trenches leading from well-upstream of the dam site to somewhere downstream. If you do this correctly, the place where you want to put the dam will no longer be in the path of the river. Ensure that the diversion channels can be closed after the dam is completed - you can do this by making sure that there is a closable gate between the beginning of each channel and the river itself.


How much water are you thinking of holding back behind your dam? You need to make sure there is enough space to hold it all - dig/blast out a reservoir in the newly-dry area between the dam site and the place where the river enters the diversion channels.;
, If you're just using rocks, you need to put the biggest ones down first, and you need to put them downstream of the rest of the material, i.e. you build the dam FROM downstream TO upstream.
 A wedge-like cross-section is best, with the thin end of the wedge pointing downstream. You can only do concave-curved downstream-surfaces with huge, government-scale dams, huge crews and millions of dollars.
, If you haven't got concrete, you'd better have done step four really well, and you'd better cover the dam with a thick layer of earth and pack it down.
 Wait until the water level behind the dam has stabilized before closing off the second. Repeat the opening/waiting for the rest of the diversion channels.

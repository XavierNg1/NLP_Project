 The best vase to use is one that has straight sides, but you can also use a mason jar instead.
 If there is any oily residue on the vase, wipe it off using rubbing alcohol.
 You can position them straight across, at different angles, or a combination of the two. You can even try overlapping some of the rubber bands. For a more interesting design, get both thick and thin rubber bands.
 A pair of safety goggles would also be highly recommended at this point. The rubber gloves are absolutely necessary, however; etching cream is caustic and can burn your skin.
 You can do this using a cheap paintbrush or a foam brush. Apply it in a thick, gloopy layer, and be careful not to "scrape" across the rubber bands. If you do, you might get some etching cream under them and disrupt the banded design.
 If you find the cream difficult to remove, you can gently scrub it off using an old toothbrush. Use an old rag or towel to dry the vase and remove any residual cream.Do not rinse the cream off in an enamel sink. Use a metal sink or a plastic bucket., Be careful not to snap the rubber bands, as some of the etching cream may have seeped under them. The etching will be faint and subtle at first, but it will become more opaque as the glass dries.If you are still not happy with the results, reapply the rubber bands and etching cream, wait another 10 to 20 minutes, and rinse it off again., You can add flowers to it, or use it as a candle votive. For an added touch, you could wrap a pretty ribbon around the middle.

 Before you start painting, itâ€™s best to decide how you want your stripes to look. For example, do you want them to be vertical or horizontal? You can also decide on their thickness, number, and shape. The thinner your stripes, the more of them you will be able to put on the wall.
 To get the cleanest and most accurate lines, draw a graph to plot out your design before your start. Using a ruler and a pencil, draw a straight vertical line down the center of the sheet of paper. Then, draw two additional vertical lines on either side of the first line. Each line should be halfway from the middle line to the outer edge of the paper.








You should now have three equidistant vertical lines going down the sheet of paper.
 Using the ruler, draw a horizontal line in the middle of the sheet of paper. Then draw two additional horizontal lines above and below it to create 16 equal-sized squares on your sheet of paper. You will use these as points of reference for your stripes.
 Starting on the square at the upper left-hand corner of the page, draw a diagonal line from the upper left-hand corner of the square to the lower right-hand corner of the square. Repeat this on each of the three squares directly below it.









Then, move onto the next column and draw a diagonal line from the upper right-hand corner to the lower left-hand corner.
Continue alternating directions and columns until you have completed filling in the remaining squares. You will then have the outline for your chevron stripes.

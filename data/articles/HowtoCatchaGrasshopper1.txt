 To catch a grasshopper, start your search in the morning or at dusk when it's cooler out- they are slower in the lower temperature than they are in the afternoon heat.Since grasshoppers have the ability to leap across incredible heights and distances, this sort of advantage is very helpful; these creatures can project themselves up to one metre ahead and 25 centimeter (9.8Â in) high.Grasshoppers also have the ability to fly, which they often employ when threatened, so trying to catch them when they are operating at a slower pace is an excellent idea., Grasshoppers can be found almost anywhere in the world, save for extremely cold regions like the North and South Pole. Grasshoppers generally live in meadows, fields, or anywhere else they can find food.Look for holes in the tissue and leaves of plants in order to spot where grasshoppers might be feeding. You can also listen for their "singing", or the chirping sound that occurs when they rub their large hind legs against their wings., Use a fine mesh net, a container with a lid and air holes, or an old shirt or sheet to catch a grasshopper in an area where you've already identified their presence.Grasshoppers are not difficult to catch; stomp the ground or rustle grass to agitate the grasshoppers and make them "jump" (i.e.catapult themselves off the ground)Once they are moving, position your container, net, or other trap to catch one.


When grasshoppers feel threatened, they spew a brown liquid as a defense mechanism; the liquid is harmless, but it may stain your clothes., If you're trying to catch a grasshopper in a container, fill the container with bits of food that will attract the insect. Put in a slice of apple, some bits of bread, a carrot, or some lettuce. Ideally, use food that is starting to turn, which you would not be consuming anyway.

 Most introverts are not interested in going to a loud bar or dance club. One-on-one dates that don’t require a lot of socialization are where they will feel most comfortable. You can also spend the one-on-one time getting to know each other and building the trust that you need to win her over., She probably understands that she is shy and might even be self-conscious about it. Don’t remind her of her shyness. Instead, help prompt subtle conversation to help her feel more comfortable.


Saying things like “Don’t be shy,” will just remind her of her shyness and likely make her uncomfortable.
She may not be good at making eye contact. If this is the case, avoid pointing that out, too.
 This is a very important step to any relationship. Shy people have a lot of wonderful qualities. For example, shy people are typically good listeners and deep thinkers.
 Silence does not have to be awkward or uncomfortable. While you probably shouldn’t spend the whole date sitting quietly, you can spend moments in silence. She will appreciate that you do not need her to talk, or listen, all the time.

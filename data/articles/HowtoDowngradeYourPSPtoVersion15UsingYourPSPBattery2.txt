 And your PSP will be recognized as a new hard disc, say K. Then click Start -] Run, input cmd in the popped up dialog box, and click OK to enter DOS system. Use the below commands one by one to run the mspformat file:
Input “H:”, and press the “Enter” Key on your keyboard. (Here H is the disc where the “pandora” folder is located)
Input “cd pandora” and press the “Enter” Key on your keyboard.
Input “cd mspformat” and press the “Enter” Key on your keyboard.
 (Here K is the name of the disc that your PSP is recognized on your computer.)

After these commands, your PSP will be logically reformatted in a minute.
 Copy and paste the “installer” folder and the “battery” folder into the “game” folder. Then copy and paste the UPDATE.PBP file to the root directory of the PSP hard disc on your computer.







On your PSP, switch to the Game option, press X or O (depending on which is the “Enter” key of your PSP). Go to “installer” and press X or O to run it.
In a few seconds, a file named “msipl.bin” will be created on the root directory of your PSP memory disc. And now, you should take out your memory disc and then put it back in, which seems to be useless but is a very necessary step.
 Then enter DOS system as mentioned in Step 1. Use the below commands one by one to run the mspformat file:

Input “H:”, and press the “Enter” Key on your keyboard.
Input “cd pandora” and press the “Enter” Key on your keyboard.
Input “cd minst” and press the “Enter” Key on your keyboard.
 (Here K is the name of the disc that your PSP is recognized on your computer.)

When you see a popped up message asking if you are sure, click “Yes”.
 Go to “battery” and press X or O to run it, press X or O to OK every popped up message to finish running the battery application.

Now, your Pandora’s battery has been created!

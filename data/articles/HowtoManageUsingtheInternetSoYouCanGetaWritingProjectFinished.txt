 Write on sticky notes and place them around the house to get you started. These notes should say something along the lines of "Get to work!" or "Write that page!";
, Think of amazing objects you want. Or some clothes that you wanna buy. These will be your bait. Just keep reminding yourself "Once I'm done this I can buy that awesome thing"

, Keep in mind that you will lose interest and go online. This is where things start getting extreme.
 You may want to lock the website from the computer, next get a friend over and have him/her make up a password for the website. This will prevent you from typing in the password and just going on the website.
 This will force you to set it back if you get distracted and you will remember "oh wait i should be working".

In the first window, you will write down or draw quick sketches or notes of your ideas.
in the second window you will take the best ideas and put them together into a readable paragraph or picture.
Once you have these ideas in good form, you will copy and past the form into the third window where you will proofread, fix, replace, and lengthen it.
, During the process of writing, you should stop and take small 10 minute breaks to clear your mind and keep you off the internet.
 Allow the friend to review what you have created. If they believe it to be good. They will give you the passwords to the sites.
 Disable the locks using the passwords.

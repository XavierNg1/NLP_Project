 The more you let your dog chase things, the more they will want to repeat that inappropriate behavior. If your dog has run after something once, it’s important to prevent them from doing it again. Address the behavior immediately by eliminating opportunities to chase things and by training them to resist the impulse altogether., If your dog loves to chase things and has not yet been trained to deny that impulse, always keep your pet on a lead when they are in a public or unenclosed area. Doing so is the only way to ensure the safety of your dog and your community.
 You can head off you pooch’s inappropriate behaviors by anticipating them. If you are approaching something that you know your dog loves chasing, head in another direction or give it a wide berth.


For instance, if they love chasing cars, choose a path that will avoid traffic or drive them directly to a park where there are no cars present.
 If you give your pooch an alternative, healthier way to express their energy and instincts, they will be less inclined to go chasing after things for fun and stimulation. This means that you need to be sure that they’re getting enough physical exercise to tire them out and enough mental exercise to keep them engaged.If your dog is high-energy but has a tendency to run away, you can still exercise them by running them in enclosed, designated off-leash areas.
To stimulate them mentally, give dogs chew toys, play fetch with them, or have them sniff out treats that you’ve hidden.

 Lolita style has nothing to do with pedophilia. The fashion and the lifestyle do not contain sexual connotations. Instead, most adherents present themselves as young Victorian, Edwardian, or Rococo children and strive to look modest and reserved. Gothic Lolita, or GothLoli, style in particular values a sober and elegant presentation.
 There are many different styles of Lolita. There's Sweet Lolita, which uses bright pastels, lace, and overall sweet and "kawaii" themes; Gothic Lolita, which uses more blacks and whites and tends to be a darker, more elegant style of Lolita; and other less common subsets such as Classic Lolita, which favors a more refined and subtle fashion, or Punk Lolita, which might include accessories such as spikes and chains. Some Lolitas like to blend more than one style in their looks; however, this article will focus primarily on achieving straightforward Gothic Lolita dress and attitude.

 Your behavior will not change them, they must do it for themselves to choose a different path. Do not feel that you must be there to be the responsible one unless there are children involved.
 A day or two away can help tremendously. Stay with a friend or relative. If appropriate, let them know what is going on at home and that sometimes you do need a break.
 Attacking the alcoholic will accomplish nothing. It is like trying to attack cancer. It is a disease. Attacking the person will only put you closer to the disease and leave you with conflicted feelings afterwards.
 You will move on if you want to. You do not have to live under the shadow of alcoholism forever.

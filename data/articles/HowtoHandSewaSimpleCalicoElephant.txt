 If you need to resize it, do so using the graph technique of enlarging or reducing, as the pattern is very simple.;
, Pin the template to the calico fabric piece.
 Repeat to obtain two elephant shapes.


Pin the two shapes together.
 Use a simple sewing stitch, just be sure to keep it fairly even. The style is naive art, so it doesn't need to be perfect; in fact, imperfection is part of this elephant's charm. Do not sew all the way â€“ leave a hole for stuffing the elephant.
 Push in the stuffing carefully. Be sure to get it into the trunk, into the toes, and into the tail zone.


At this stage, you might like to add the elephant's heart and brains (stars). Optional but a very special step for children making the elephant.
, Cut a suitable length of tail from the braid. To prevent fraying of the braid, tie a knot.


Fray out the threads outside of the knot give the impression of the tail's end. Sew the other end of the tail to the elephant's backside. Check that it is sitting properly.
 Cut a small elephant's ear shape from the felt. Be sure to proportion it with the size of your elephant. Stitch the ear to the top layer of the elephant at the long edge. This will allow the ear to "flap" when moved. Tie off well.
 Use embroidery thread to create an eye. You can either sew around and around to make an eye, or use a French knit.
 Use two strands of embroidery thread (single knot) to create trunk lines. Sew up and down only.


It might be easier to draw in the toe shapes first. Use a disappearing marker for best results.






Use simple stitch lines to outline the toes.
 Plump up your newborn elephant and he is ready for play or to embellish another one of your craft projects.

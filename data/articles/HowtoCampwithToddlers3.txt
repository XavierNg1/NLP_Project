 This activity can be fun for most toddlers, and can teach them the basics of camping. Examples of activities your toddler can perform are collecting small sticks or kindling for use in building a fire, or helping you with setting up tents and other camping supplies.
 Examples of activities that may be fun for your toddler are short hikes, bicycle rides, or wildlife adventures that consist of finding new leaves or insects.
 Your child should be shown ways to clean up after themselves, ways to dispose of waste properly, and the methods for respecting plants, vegetation, and animals during hikes and exploration.

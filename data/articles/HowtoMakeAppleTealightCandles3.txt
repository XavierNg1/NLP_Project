For a fall theme, you could fill a large tub with water and fill it with lit floating apples.
A large, Golden Delicious apple perched upon a small saucer placed as a centerpiece on each table might be a great way to celebrate your childâ€™s teacher at the next teacher's luncheon.
A tall cylindrical vase filled 3/4 full with water would be beautiful with a floating apple candle holder on top! Also, the water could be colored to compliment the apple or a theme of choice.

 Install safety gates in front of rooms and areas that contain potential hazards like bathrooms, laundry rooms, and older siblingsâ€™ rooms. Purchase gates that mount into the wall instead of pressure gates. Pressure gates are ineffective because babies can knock them down if they use them to stand up, or if they push on them too hard.If your house has stairs, make sure to install mounted safety gates at the bottom and top of the stairs.
Also, place screens in front of fireplaces.
 Install child-guard latches on cabinets and drawers that contain objects and materials that are potentially hazardous. For example, install latches on cabinets and drawers that contain household chemicals, medicines/vitamins, toiletries, sharp objects like scissors and knives, and other potentially harmful products and objects.Use trash bins with child-resistant covers.
Fill and unlock one cabinet with baby-safe toys and objects in order to divert your baby from off-limits cabinets.
 Because crawling babies might use large pieces of furniture to stand up, you will want to mount these to the wall. This will prevent large furniture from falling over and injuring your child. Use wall anchors to secure furniture to the wall.You can purchase wall mounts from your local hardware store.
Mount standing bookcases, shelves, cabinets, and other unstable pieces of furniture to the wall.
 Use either window locks or screens to secure these windows. These safety measures will prevent your baby from climbing out of a window.Additionally, secure long chords from drapes and blinds by rolling them up and placing them out of reach.
 A crawling baby needs constant supervision. Being proactive and supervising your baby at all times is the best way to keep it safe. If you cannot supervise your baby, either place it in a secure playpen, its crib, or a swing until you can resume supervising it.

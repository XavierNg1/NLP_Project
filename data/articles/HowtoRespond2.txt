 Sometimes your initial reaction is one of defensiveness or anger; however, this will not benefit you in the long run. Remain calm and take several deep breaths while you gather your thoughts.
 It’s ok to say, “I’m not sure I understand completely. Could you please explain a little more in depth?”

, If the criticism seems valid, you should respond by agreeing and thanking the person for bringing it to your attention. Your humility will show you in a positive light., If it is someone who always criticizes, or if you are likely to look bad if you disagree, you might want to save face by saying “Thank you for your input” and moving on., Again, agree and move on.
 If the person is insulting you or telling your superior or friends something that isn’t true, you should respond by respectfully disagreeing, while remaining calm.
 Being criticized can be a blow, but your response can build you up rather than bring you down. Thinking about it, improving yourself and moving on is a good way to build emotional resilience.

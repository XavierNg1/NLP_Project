 Not all jump ropes have handle caps, but if your jump rope has a handle cap, you will need to remove it before proceeding. Follow the product instructions for how to remove the handle cap.
 Pull enough rope through the handle to cut rope to the desired length. Measure this length twice before cutting it off.


Leave a few extra inches if you will be knotting the end of the rope after you cut it.
If you will be crimping the end of the rope with a clamp that was included with your jump rope, then you can leave a little less length. But it is a good idea to err on the side of caution and leave yourself a few extra inches just in case.
 Step on the middle of the rope and hold the other end to make the rope slightly taut, then make the cut. Do not stretch the rope beyond it's normal length before you make the cut, just make sure that it is straight when you cut it.
 With the end of your rope still pulled through the jump rope handle, tie a knot in the rope or use the crimp that was included with your jump rope to secure the end of your rope. Follow the product instructions for removing the crimp from the severed rope and replacing it on the resized rope.
 Make sure that you have enough space to jump rope and that you can see the topmost part of your jump rope as it swings over your head. If you can jump rope in front of a large mirror, that is ideal. If not, ask a friend to watch you. As you jump rope, notice the distance between the top of your head and the middle of your rope.


For beginner jumpers, this distance should be about 16-30 inches. For fitness jumpers, this distance should be about 6-10 inches. For speed jumpers, this distance should be about 2-6 inches. Speed and control , If your jump rope still seems too long, readjust it by removing another inch or two off the end and knotting or crimping the end.

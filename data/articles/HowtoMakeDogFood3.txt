 Go to your grocery store or butcher and purchase one of the following types of raw meat. Buy it with the bone in, since uncooked bones are soft enough for your dog to chew and eat.


Chicken without bones. Poultry bones are brittle, they can get stuck in the dogs throat and can therefore be very dangerous to eat for your pup.
Pork meat, bones, head and tail.
Cow meat (not bones, since they are too hard) or calf meat and calf bones.
Lamb meat, bones and heads.
 Raw meat can be supplemented with other flavorful sources of vitamins and minerals your dog needs to be healthy.


Liver, heart, and tripe.
Whole eggs.
Tinned or whole fresh fish.
 Dogs eating a raw food diet get almost everything they need from meat, but including some vegetables in their diet is a great way to add variety. Puree one or more of the following vegetables in the blender:

Spinach, carrots, collards or parsnips.
Apples, pears or other fruit your dog likes.
 Fill your dog's bowl with the proper amount of food according to her weight. It should be composed of mostly raw meat with a few extras and a dollop of vegetables or fruit. Store leftover meat and other dog food in an airtight food container in the refrigerator.

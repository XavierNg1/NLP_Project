 It's important to note that deactivating your Kik account won't necessarily clear your message history. Luckily, however, this can easily be done within the app itself, so it's not inconvenient to do this immediately before deactivating your account with the steps above. To start, open your Kik app on your mobile device.
 Once the app is open, click the icon in the top right of the screen that looks like a gear or cog (it should be right next to a speech bubble icon.) This will take you to the Settings menu.
 Click on the "Your Account" option. Next, click the "Reset Kik Messenger" button near the bottom of the screen.
 Hit the "Yes" button in the confirmation pop-up that appears. This will delete all of history and messages associated with your account. In addition, this will close Kik and log you out.


At this point, if you wish, you can proceed to deactivate your account with the steps above.

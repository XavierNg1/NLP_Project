 Place your hands flat on the top of your chair. You will need to make sure you are using a firm chair, without a cushion, because you need to balance while lifting your body weight during this exercise.
 Bring your feet 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) off the ground. Use your arms to lift your butt off your chair, as high as your hold will allow, or approximately 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm).
 Stop if your muscles feel excessively fatigued and you lose the proper position. Lower yourself down to the chair gently and rest for 10 seconds.
 Work toward holding the position for 20 seconds to 1 minute.

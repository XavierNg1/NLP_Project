 You can use a plastic or glass tub. Avoid using a metal tub since you will be running an electrical current through the water. The size of the tub does not matter, but a good starting point would be to use a 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) container., You will need two alligator clips. One will connect to your positive electrode (the anode) and the other will connect to your negative electrode (the cathode). Tape one end of each clip to the inside bottom of the tub. Make sure to leave enough space so that you can still open and close the clip., You will need two electrodes made from an non-reactive material that conducts electricity well. An optimum choice is platinum, but if you don’t have platinum electrodes lying around, you can use graphite. Shave the wood off of two pencils to make two graphite rods. These rods will make great electrodes. Clip one to each alligator clip inside the tub.

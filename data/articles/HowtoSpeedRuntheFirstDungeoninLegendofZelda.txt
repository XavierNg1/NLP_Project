,,,, Caution-levers will pop out of the ground. Go slowly until they both pop up, then advance up. Kill the Octoroks ONLY to clear a path to the bridge. If the Zora(fish guy) pops up near you, avoid the fireball he shoots, then cross.
, If you aren't, exit the dungeon immediately, then go back in and then go left.
 The keeses' movements are too unpredictable to get a good shot using your sword beam.
,, Avoid the Stalfos, but you can swing a couple of times to clear a path should you need it.
 Avoid them and head left.
, Avoid the gels here, and go right.
,, Here, Goriyas try to stun you with boomerangs. Kill the lone Goriya on the somewhat left side of the room, below the water in the middle of the room, then face upwards towards the Goriyas on the other side. Aligning your shield so it can deflect a boomerang attack, slice with your sword. They cannot reach you, but you can reach them. Repeat until they are dead.
,, Don't fight the Goriyas here, they will waste your time. Avoid them.
 However, Wallmasters materialize from the wall to abduct you and unhand you at the beginning of the dungeon. Get kidnapped by these, and your speed run is over.
 His vulnerability lies with his unarmored horn. Attack that area with your sword directly, moving to avoid fireballs. Better, use sword beams to fry Aquementus. Even safer, plant a bomb RIGHT after the miserable dragon releases its fireballs. When it explodes, plant another one at the horn area. It should be dead, with no harm to you.

;
, Once you've found a "Scramball", gather up all of your friends and family. Around 6 - 50 people would be good.
, Once the numbers are given, start the game by throwing the Scramball way up into the air.
 While the ball is in the air, the person who threw the ball needs to call out a random number they just gave to one of their players.
 Once the ball hits the ground, the person whose number has just been called goes for the ball.
 Headshots count.
Getting back in: If the person who killed you just got eliminated, you are back in.
Bounces: If the Scramball bounces and hits you, you are not out.
Double Touches: If you touch the Scramball off of a bounce or accidentally drop it, it is called a Double Touch (Place the Scramball back on the ground if you just noticed you Double Touched).
No walking or running with the Scramball.
How to win: The person who eliminates everyone wins.
Catching: If you the catch the Scramball in mid-air, you got the person who threw the Scramball out.

 Anxiety as a tendency to build on itself, meaning that feeling anxious about your performance will make it more likely that you will finish even quicker. Instead, think confidently about your ability to last longer. If you start to feel anxious, stop and take a breath, and think about how you enjoy sex with your partner, rather than your worries over finishing early., Some doctors believe that finishing prematurely may be the result of personal problems or bad habits developed in past experiences, both in your current relationship and in previously ones. By identifying these possible trouble spots, you can better work through them with your partner or a therapist.Some problems from your past include hurrying to climax in order to avoid being discovered, or rushing through sexual encounters to avoid guilt.
 The desire to last longer is usually about increasing the pleasure and intimacy for both of you. If this has only become an issue recently, or with your current partner, it may be a sign of interpersonal difficulties between the two of you. Consider talking with your partner about your relationship and any issues that may have arisen recently.


Talking to your partner may also demonstrate that you have nothing to worry about. Your partner may not find anything wrong with how long you last. At the same time, your partner may also have some ideas for new positions and foreplay that can increase intimacy and passion, as well as the length of time., You can consider counseling to work through relationship or other issues. A counselor can be particularly helpful in terms of reducing stress and overcoming performance anxiety. If you think your problems are relationship-based, you may want to visit the therapist or counselor with your partner.Counseling sessions tend to be most helpful when combined with drug therapy, so they may not always be the most natural course. This, of course, depends on the kind of problems you are having.

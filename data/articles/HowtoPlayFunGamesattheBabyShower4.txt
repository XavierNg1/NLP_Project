 Before the shower you will want to hide these items in rooms that won't be accessed during the party. Have the clues written on parchment paper rolled up and secured with ribbon. The first clue will be handed to the parents (or mommy) the remaining clues will be hidden with each item as it is found.
 In your comforting arms she (he) will want to be cuddled. Underneath this gift you can both be huddled. There is something for baby and something for mom. Something for daddy and something for all." (now the hostess will add a clue revealing where the gift is hidden example: hidden in a room at the top of the stairs, take a sharp left, open the door, it is there!). Hidden in this room could be a Moses Basket with A Soft Throw blanket and A DVD of a television series mom or dad really likes and a CD to dance with baby to that mother or father likes!)

, Or even if we haven't, the guests invited have. As hostesses it is our duty to make a great memory for the new mommy and daddy. One of the greatest gifts a hostess gives the new parents is this great gathering of people who have nothing but love for them and the new little one. By putting in some original thought and obvious mental effort....you are sure to delight your guests and create an atmosphere of sentiment and excitement. Do not be afraid to be original. Do not feel that you must adhere to some "preordained" to-do list for this celebration. Only you know these people the way that you do. You have chosen to organize this wonderful celebration and make it special. Make a memory!!


Good luck and celebrate with your baby!

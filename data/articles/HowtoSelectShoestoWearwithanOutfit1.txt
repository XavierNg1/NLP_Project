Wear simple black heels or flats when wearing a dress with a bright, bold pattern. If you were to wear a more complex shoe, it would be too overwhelming in the opinion of some. Obviously, you can wear whatever shoes you like provided there is no dress code to obey or health and safety issues to consider.
Consider neutral or 'nude' heels or flats if you have on a sparkly evening top.;
,


Add a pop of color by pairing a red heel with a black or brown dress.
Try a dressy shoe with a funky pattern, like alligator skin, if you have on a simple blouse and neutral trousers or jeans.
 For instance, if you have on a blouse with a geometric pattern including the colors purple and pink, consider a deep purple shoe.
 Do not wear one solid color from head to toe. If you have on a blue blouse and a blue skirt, avoid wearing blue shoes, unless you want to. Remember the fashion police can't actually charge you with anything!

, If you have a light pink blouse on, try wearing a rose-colored flat or heel instead of a shoe in the same shade of pink.



Wear brown or black leather shoes at a conservative office. Grey and navy a red good choices for the office too.
Incorporate color only if you have a less strict office with a corporate casual dress code.

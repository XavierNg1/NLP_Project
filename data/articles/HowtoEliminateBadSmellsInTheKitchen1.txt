 Disposing of spills down the drain or in the garbage can will prevent them from becoming stuck on the counter or prevalent in the air.;
, Do large pots and pans by hand or place them in the dishwasher. If the dishes need to soak, place them in the sink with some soap and hot water right after you use them, to decrease the amount of time the cooked food or burnt bottom can be pungent.
 If you are cooking with oil, fish, garlic, onions or other pungent odors, place a small wastebasket or plastic bag close by. Use this garbage for scraps that should be taken out immediately after food preparation.
 Make a plan to wipe down surfaces while you cook and to deep clean weekly. Grease spots will attract more food, leading to more kitchen odors if left too long.
 Wash your dishtowels, potholders and rugs every week. All these items can get wet and breed bacteria or mold.
 Close the containers and place them in the refrigerator. This will help to prevent food smells from permeating into the house.
 Not only do ventilation systems remove bad odors, but they also improve the quality of the air in your kitchen. Unless you are experienced with home construction, you will need to get a consultation and advice from a professional venting company.


If you cannot afford to install a range hood or fan above your range, open your windows. Although this is not possible in all climes, cooking with the windows open will remove bad odors and allow them to drift outside, rather than through the house.

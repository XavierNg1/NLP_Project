 Take your eggs and break them into a large bowl. Add in eggnog, sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and vanilla. Whisk together until well blended., Take the loaf of bread and, using a sharp knife, cut it into 1 inch (2.5Â cm) cubes. Take the cubes and add them to the egg mixture. Toss the cubes in the mixture until they are completely coated.
 Grease a baking dish with butter or nonstick spray. Pour your ingredients in the dish. Make sure you add any extra mixture that did not coat the bread. Cover the dish with aluminum foil or plastic wrap. Place in the fridge overnight.


Soaking the bread for this long allows the cubes to fully soak in the mixture, which makes the bread soft and creamy instead of bready.
If you don't want to leave the dish overnight, you need to let it soak for at least 8 hours.
 After you have let your dish soak, take it out of the fridge. Preheat your oven at 350 degrees. Mix the brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl. Uncover the dish and sprinkle the mixture over the top of the dish.
 Bake the bread for 45 minutes uncovered. The egg mixture should be cooked and the bread should be golden brown. Serve in bowls and enjoy.

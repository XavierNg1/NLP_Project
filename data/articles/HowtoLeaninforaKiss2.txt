 Edge towards them on the couch or walk up closer to them. Just do something to show them that you want to be near them. As you get closer to them, start speaking more softly and more slowly. The idea is to make the situation feel more intimate. By getting closer and talking more quietly, they’ll know that you only have eyes on them., Initiate some sort of physical touch, whether it’s romantic or not. Hold their hand, rest your arm or leg against theirs, or even just find an excuse to touch their shoulder or back. Once you’ve had that first physical contact, you’ll become more comfortable. Think about big kissing scenes in movies: the two actors are typically touching in someway before the kiss occurs. Bridge the gap, and find a way to touch the person you want to kiss.If they react well to your touch, that’s a great sign. Obviously, if they pull away or look uncomfortable, respect that. That’s a great way to know they aren’t ready to kiss, without getting rejected in a bigger way.
 This will let them know you’re thinking about kissing them, and that you want to be kissed. Don’t stare like laser beams, without blinking or glancing into their eyes. Just continuously glance down at their mouth as you touch, get closer, and continue talking.They should get the idea.

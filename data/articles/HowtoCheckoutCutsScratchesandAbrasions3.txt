 If the wound isn't very bad, the bleeding should stop in a few minutes. Then, you'll want to clean the wound using warm water and a gentle soap.
 For extra protection, you can use an antibacterial ointment or a bandage. Antibacterial ointment will kill germs. A bandage will keep your wound from getting irritated and will prevent germs from getting inside. If you use a bandage, it should be changed daily and when it gets wet or dirty.

 It's best to get it freshly ground at the butcher, but you can get it pre-packaged as well.;
, You can do this using a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula. Keep mixing until everything is evenly combined. Do not add the oil yet; save it for frying.


To save dishes, beat the egg with a fork or mini whisk in the large bowl first, then add the rest of the ingredients (except for the oil, of course).
For a twist, omit the garlic and oregano, and use 1 small, diced onion and Â¼ cup (5 grams) of fresh, chopped parsley., Using your hands or a spoon, form the mixture into small balls, about 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) wide. Set them down on a smooth surface as you finish them so that they don't stick.
 If the skillet is not big enough to fit all of the meatballs, consider using only 1 tablespoon of olive oil for the first batch, and another tablespoon for the second batch. This way, you won't run into the risk of some meatballs being much oilier than others.
 This will take about 10 to 15 minutes. Avoid cramming all of the meatballs into the pan, or they won't cook properly.To make the meatballs extra crispy, roll them in some all-purpose flour first., You can serve them with some lemon wedges, tzatziki, or your favorite pasta and pasta sauce.

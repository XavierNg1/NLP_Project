 Don't feed your neopet expensive neggs. Neggs are a 1-bite item, whereas jellies are 2 bites and omelettes are 3. Sell the neggs, and buy cheap plain omelettes or jellies. Additionally, don't board your pet in at AstroVilla - Cockroach Towers is literally 100 times cheaper, and offers the same services. Also, never select any special services, they do nothing and only take your neopoints.
 If you have less than 3,000 nps between your bank account and your shop till, feed your pet for free at the Soup Kitchen. With a little extra work, you can also get into the Soup Kitchen no matter how much money you have.
 The third of every month is half-price day, so don't forget to check in for some good deals on items you can put in your shop.
 Your pet only needs one toy to be happy. Sell the rest and turn a profit.

 In general, the closer you are to the person, the more direct you should be. If it is a friend or close work acquaintance, this is a great strategy, but if it is a superior or a relative stranger, consider dropping hints first since they are more likely to be offended since the two of you are not very close., No matter how nice you say it, bringing up bad breath to a person will be uncomfortable and could cause embarrassment. To ease the discomfort a bit, be sure to wait to bring it up until you are alone with the person, or ask the person if you can speak with them in private if the problem needs to be solved quickly.
 It is very important to understand that there is a difference between being direct and being insensitive. When being direct, it is important to avoid teasing, making any unkind comparisons like “Your breath smells like a sewer,” or having a critical attitude or disgusted body language.Some ideas for considerate, compassionate conversation starters include:


“I noticed something, and I’m not sure if you’re aware, but your breath smells a bit off."
“Sorry to mention this, but you have some bad breath right now.”
“If the situation was reversed I would want someone to tell me, so I thought I’d let you know that you could use a breath mint right now.”

, After letting them know that their breath is problematic, it is important to then help them solve this problem. That could mean offering them a mint, inviting them to take a walk to a convenient store to get some gum, or talking about your own issues with bad breath.

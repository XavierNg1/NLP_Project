 If you mainly use your computer for work, school, and surfing the internet, still play it safe and cover your needs with at least a decent all-around monitor.


If price isn’t much of an issue, consider getting a 27 inch flat screen with 4K (3,840x2,160) resolution that uses an IPS/PLS panel.
A more affordable option is a slightly downgraded version of this with a 24 inch screen with 1,920x1,080 (FDH) resolution., The bigger the screen, the better the gaming experience. Also, video games are a lot more enjoyable when you aren’t dealing with lagging.


Get a monitor with a large, curved screen that has a response time of five milliseconds or less.
 If you’re a photographer or graphic designer, you’ll need the biggest possible screen, the best possible resolution, and a monitor that uses an IPS/PLS panel.


Your display should be at least 27 inches and a 4K or even 5K resolution is best.
Consider getting a second display if you frequently edit photos.

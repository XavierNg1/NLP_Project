 Place ¼ cup (32 grams) sorghum kernels in a small paper bag. Roll the open end of the bag up tightly and fold it so it stays closed. Do not use a plastic bag, as it will melt.If you wish to encourage popping, toss the kernels in a small bowl with a bit of melted butter or oil. Place the bag on a plate if you do this so you don’t end up with a greasy mess in your microwave.
 With your bag of sorghum closed, place the closed fold face-down in the microwave. Set the heat for two minutes. Check the sorghum after the timer expires. If a significant amount of sorghum remains unpopped, microwave it for another minute., As your sorghum pops, it will make an audible sound. When the sound of popping sorghum falls to a frequency of less than once every few seconds, take your sorghum out and pour it into a bowl.Your sorghum should not need more than three minutes to pop. If it does, consider increasing the strength setting on your microwave.

 The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the side lengths of a right triangle, and c{\displaystyle c} equals the length of a right triangleâ€™s hypotenuse.You use the Pythagorean Theorem because a diagonal of a rectangle cuts the rectangle into two congruent right triangles.The length and width of the rectangle are the side lengths of the triangle; the diagonal is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
;
, These should be given, or you should be able to measure them. Make sure you are substituting for a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}.

For example, if the width of a rectangle is 3 cm, and the length is 4 cm, your formula will look like this: 32+42=c2{\displaystyle 3^{2}+4^{2}=c^{2}}.
 Remember, squaring a number means to multiply the number by itself.

For example:32+42=c2{\displaystyle 3^{2}+4^{2}=c^{2}}9+16=c2{\displaystyle 9+16=c^{2}}25=c2{\displaystyle 25=c^{2}}


, The easiest way to find a square root is to use a calculator. You can use an online calculator if you do not have a scientific calculator.This will give you the value of c{\displaystyle c}, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and the diagonal of the rectangle.

For example:25=c2{\displaystyle 25=c^{2}}25=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}5=c{\displaystyle 5=c}So, the diagonal of a rectangle with a width of 3 cm and a length of 4 cm is 5 cm.

 Fill your broken pot with soil that slopes upwards and away from the broken section of the pot. Arrange your potsherds in the soil to create terraces or to section off the inside of your pot in interesting ways.


When arranging your potsherds, you may want to first add a small amount of soil to the pot, then insert the potsherds, then add more soil to hold potsherds in place.
Small potsherds can be pushed into the sides of sloping soil to form stairways in your broken pot fairy village. You might also use small pieces of wood to simulate the same effect., You can find miniature buildings, decorations, and so on at craft stores, hobby shops, or even at stores that sell aquarium decorations. Nest these in the soil according to your preference. Once you have your buildings places, you can add other features and greenery for your fairy garden.Don't be afraid to add models and decorations you've made yourself. These can make your fairy village look even more authentic. For example, you could add a popsicle model house, a model castle, or even a fairy house.
 The more details you add, the more it will seem like your fairy village is actually occupied by these tiny, mystical creatures. Think about adding features a fairy might use, were it living in your village. Some examples include:


A miniature bus stop for fairies.
Tiny mail boxes outside of fairy houses and buildings.
Benches where fairies can sit.
Small birdhouses.

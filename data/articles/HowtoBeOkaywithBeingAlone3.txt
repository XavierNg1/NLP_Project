 If you've got friends and you've tried everything else and it just isn't working, it's time to meet some hotties. Find that girl/guy you've been dreaming of and meet them. Nothing is going to happen if you just sit there. Get up and talk to them. Stares mean nothing unless they actually try to say something to you.
 Yet another thing to keep in mind- You're not in a fairytale so stop living in one. You can't expect someone to do something or say something. Are we the Sims? No. Are you god? No. There is no such thing as a "Happy Ending". In fact, that's also a complete fallacy. You want to get something done? Go out and do it. But stop expecting someone to be something they're not.
 Be happy. Enjoy the little things. You never know if it's going to end so make the best of it. Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

, You can be fulfilled by yourself. Something other than boys/girls/whatever you're in to that makes you happy.

 Have at least one sister and hope they're younger than you because the older sisters probably will be too busy.;
, Tell them you want to create a club.Then ask them if they want to join. If they say no, beg. Also tell them how cool it would be and some of the activities and parties.For example, tell her she'll get to eat (insert in the blank) at every meeting.Try to convince her to join.
 In this meeting, prepare to tell them who should be president, secretary, etc.Since you're the one that started the club, you should be president. Treasurer is kinda optional but you'd want one because if you babysit, you can give Treasurer the money and then you could use the money to buy candy or something else for a SC (sisters club) party. Vote for the other positions. If there's only 2 of you girls,you can each get 2 positions.
 Be creative with the design and try to have it symbolize something about the group. Make sure you all agree on the chosen logo.
 It depends on the holiday. For example, if it was Saint Patrick's Day, serve clover shaped cookies or drink mint juice because it's green or another green drink.
 Let them hold meetings whenever they want to. You don't want people to drop out of the club, so go with the flow and listen to ideas from all the group members when making plans and choices.

 When using a knot to tie your headscarf, it can be difficult to get the knot just right. If the knot is too lose, your scarf will shift, and if you tie it too tight, it can cause headaches. Instead, use a hair tie to keep your headscarf secure. Start by placing your hair tie on your dominant wrist.








If you use a hair tie with a metal piece on it, you might put a hole in your head scarf. Try to use hair ties without this piece.
Your hair should be in a low bun or under a cap for this style.
 Many headscarves are square shaped. Simply fold it in half to achieve the rectangle shape needed.
 If you’ve never tied a scarf on your head before, it will feel very foreign on your head and you’ll have difficulty tying it. Putting the scarf on as though it’s hair will make it more comfortable for you to work with. It will be as though you’re tying up a ponytail.
 Scoop all of the material behind your head. You should do this as if you are going to tie it in a very low ponytail.









You may cover your ears or wrap the scarf above them. That’s totally up to you!

, Pretend you’re pulling the hair tie over all of your hair to make it a more natural movement. Next, tie it as if you’re tying a bun in your hair. Use your opposite hand to take the band and tie the rest of the material up as though it was a messy bun.
 Tug on the material until you get the shape you’d like out of the “knot” in the scarf. Do this by pulling on different parts of the scarf little by little. If you happen to pull too much in one direction, you can wrap it back into your hair tie.

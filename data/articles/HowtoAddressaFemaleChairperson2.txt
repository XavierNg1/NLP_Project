 Include the woman's full name, any titles or honorifics (such as J.D. or PhD), and her full chair title.


For example, you may write "Dr. Rose Smith, Chair of the Search Committee." You can also use "Rose Smith, Chairwoman."
It is also permissible to use other honorifics such as Dr., Judge, or Honorable.
 Use the same name and title on the envelope and on the header of the letter itself.


The exception is the greeting line, which can be shorter and omit lengthier titles if necessary.
 In a very formal business letter, always use the person's complete title in the address and greeting line.


A formal letter may begin with "Dear Chair Smith," or "Dear Madam Chair."
A less formal letter, email, or memo may omit the full title. You may write "Dear Dr. Smith" or "Dear Ms. Smith," but avoid "Mrs." unless you have been specifically instructed otherwise by the chair herself. When in doubt, err on the side of a more formal address.
These rules are not hard and fast, since different women may have different preferences. Follow the woman's personal preference if she would rather be addressed as "Mrs." or something else.

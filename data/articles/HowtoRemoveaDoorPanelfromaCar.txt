,, Pull on it so that you can see if there is a screw underneath the lever. Remove the screw and remove the hard plastic casing around the door lever.
 You will find screws that hold the armrest to the door. (Sometimes these screws are under plastic covers that have to be popped out with a flat screwdriver.) Remove the screws. Remove the armrest. If your windows are electric, remove the wires attached to the armrest by squeezing the plastic sides of the plug-ins.
 Sometimes there is a screw in the center of the crank underneath a decorative cover (old VW Beetle). Pry off the cover and unscrew. Sometimes there is a circlip around the base of the crank. Pry the circlip away from the window crank with a flat screwdriver.
 The panel is held to the metal part of the door by means of several plastic grommets, attached to the back of the cardboard panel that fit into holes. Gently pop the grommets out of their holes, trying not to rip them out of the cardboard panel.
 Remove screws if there are any.

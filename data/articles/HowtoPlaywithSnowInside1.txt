 Fill buckets, bins, cups and canisters with snow to tote it inside without a mess. You can then transfer it to a larger container, like a bathtub or insulated cooler, which will let you keep your activities confined to one area.Look for clean, fresh patches of snow clear of any dirt, sticks or leaves.
Snow sometimes comes into contact with icky things on the ground, so don’t forget to wash your containers after use.;
, If the heat is on full blast, the snow will be gone before you really have a chance to do much with it. Turn down the thermostat a few degrees and shut off any space heaters in the area where you’ll be playing. This way, you’ll be able enjoy it longer.


Wear gloves when you’re handling the snow to keep your hands from getting cold.
 Keep the snow cold when it’s not in use. If the container you used to collect it is too big to fit in the freezer, you can move it to a plastic shopping bag or piece of Tupperware. Just be sure to get your fun in quickly—after a day or two, the snow will most likely freeze into one solid block.


If you keep your supply of snow stored correctly, you’ll be able to keep playing with it longer after the rest has melted.
Keep snow separated from any open food or drink items in the freezer.

 This way if you are deleted, you still have control over your pages.


Back-up your albums, even if your soul purpose for your Facebook account is to share photos. The photos once re-sized to Facebook quality take up little room. It might be more than worth it to save your photos on another site or on your computer in folders of 60 (or however big your albums are), just as you have them on your Facebook account. Then to re-upload it's as easy as select all and upload, but if you have a slow connection, it is a pain.
This is handled by having two separate accounts with a different name and email address and such. This helps, if you have other interests like a life besides activism. For instance, one could create an account solely for political protesting, and another more personal account for backpacking, travel and contacts. It might seem silly to go to such an extent, but this way your personal photos and travel memories are safe from deletion if your activism account goes.;
, It might also help to copy-paste your 'info' somewhere, maybe just to your new account. Hold off on inviting friends to the new account until your current account is deleted to save on confusion.
 To be safe -- do no more than 2 albums a day, and no more than 4 a week.
 Then let your friends do the rest. It's part of the fun!

, One of the things you are likely to get nailed for is tagging. Facebook sees it as a form of spamming if you go through album after album and tag every photo.
 It has played a key role in gathering the people, as an amazing tool. But, you could just forget Facebook altogether. However, it is the biggest and most used social networking tool out there today.

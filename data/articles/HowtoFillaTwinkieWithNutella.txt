 Make sure it is oriented towards you and that it has no signs of damage or affliction. It should be bright yellow and slightly moist to the touch, in a shape resembling a log. Do not use a Twinkie that appears defective in any way! It is one of the two crucial ingredients in this tutorial and its conditions cannot be any less than ideal.;
, Try to cut it into halves, with equal amounts of cream in each half. Lay the sections of the Twinkie next to one another, like so, and either set your knife to the side or put it in the dishwasher (since you won't be needing it from this point onward).
 Place this extracted mixture of cream and yellow cake somewhere out of your way. Remember, you do not have to get every single morsel out--just enough so there is room for the Nutella. You also don't need to be too careful as you're sculpting the insides, since the point of this culinary creation is taste, not aesthetics.
 Stir it well, especially if you have just opened the container, and once its consistency is smooth enough take a spoonful of Nutella and spread it inside your Twinkie halves. Repeat this action until you have a satisfactory amount of filling in both parts. Now place the halves back together, so your Twinkie looks the same as it did before except for the gleam of Nutella on the side.
 If you are enjoying your Nutella-filled Twinkie by yourself, you might want to add a few more elements to complete the experience, like a banana or a tall glass of milk. You can even put peanut butter or ice cream on the side for a decadent dessert. If you are making more than one Chocolate Sunshine Indulgence (as those of us in the biz like to call it), make sure that you are in possession of the correct Twinkie-to-Nutella proportions. Most people find that three or four spoonfuls of Nutella per Twinkie will suffice, but you should figure your personal preferences before you prepare this delicacy for others. Happy eating!

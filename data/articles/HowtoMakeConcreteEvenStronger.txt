Reinforcing strength is obtained by adding either fiber reinforcing, deformed reinforcing bars (rebar), welded wire fabric, or other optional reinforcing materials.;
, For foundations, slabs, and beams, you may simply order a high-strength ready-mix concrete from a ready-mix plant. This product is usually available in standard design mix strengths of up to 5,000PSI.
 An example would be to use more portland cement and less sand for a home made concrete mix. Large aggregate like gravel and crushed limestone do not affect the strength of concrete as much as the cement to sand ratio.
 The higher the cement/fly ash to sand ratio is, the stronger the resulting concrete will be.
 High-early additives, retarders, and other specialized chemicals are used in industrial concrete to increase its strength and regulate curing times.
 Up-sizing rebar, installing multiple mats of reinforcing, and decreasing spacing between bars.

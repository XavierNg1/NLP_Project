 Most soup cleanses last for three days, but they can last for one or even five days.You don’t have to eat soup for every meal for the rest of your life to reap the benefits. Start with one day, then a few weeks or months later, go for three or five days. Or start with a five day cleanse first. It’s up to you.
 During your soup cleanse, start by having six meals for yourself each day. Remember, you are just eating vegetable packed soups throughout the day and nothing else. If you are hungry, add another serving of soup to your day.


Some people suggest eating once an hour on a soup cleanse., Soups for the cleanse can be made by just adding any vegetables to your broth. Another way you can make easy soups is to put one vegetable, like kale, spinach, turnips, butternut squash, or beets, into a food processor and pureeing it to make a creamy pureed soup; however, if you want to get some more ideas for soups, search online. There are numerous detox soups or healthy soups for you to try.
 When making soups, be sure to only cook soups that include vegetables and all-natural ingredients. Do not eat any cream soups that contain dairy because soup cleanses removes dairy. Make sure not to eat soups with wheat products, flour, or pasta.


When a detox soup says a "creamed kale or spinach," it means pureed, not that it contains dairy products.
 Water helps flush your body. It removes toxins and waste, and it also helps move nutrients to where they need to go. Try to drink eight to 10 eight ounce glasses of water during your cleanse.

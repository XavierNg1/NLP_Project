 Obviously, you cannot send the ball through the legs if they are very closely spaced. The best position for a nutmeg is when the defenders legs are spaced at least 20–30 centimeter (7.9–11.8 in) apart. This usually happens in a standing position when you are going one on one with the defender.
 You need to stand in such a way that the two of you face each other, since this makes it easier to place the leg. With experience and expertise, you can nutmeg anyone from almost any angle., You need to kick the ball as though it is a pass i.e. you have to kick it with your side foot. the power needs to be about 70 percent, so that it isn't so slow that the defender can react, and not so fast that you cannot do the follow up, A nutmeg is not complete unless and until you get the ball after you get the ball through. For this, you need to run around the defender, and capture the ball. Keep practicing!

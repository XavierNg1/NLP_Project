 Wet hair dries shorter and to a different shape. You won't get the accuracy you'll need for great bangs by cutting them wet.Air drying is best to keep your hair healthy. However, if you're pressed for time a blow dry is fine.
 Use a comb to bring your bangs forward over your face. If you don't currently have bangs, create a triangular part.First, comb out all of your hair and part it down the center. Find where your head starts to slope forward. Visualize a triangle made up of this point and the top two points of your forehead. Comb the hair in this section forward to make up your bangs.
 Comb the rest of your hair backwards and keep it in place. Use a hair tie, clips, or bobby pins. This will prevent your hair from falling forward where you may mistakenly cut it.

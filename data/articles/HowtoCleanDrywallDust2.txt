 It’s not ideal, but cleaning frequently throughout the project can help you reduce a lot of dust. How often you stop to clean is up to you, but at minimum you need to clean at least once per day.


Wipe down surfaces with a microfiber towel or a damp cloth. Use a vacuum cleaner to get up the dust on the floor.
Do not remove your face mask during cleaning. Breathing in drywall dust can cause serious health problems., Dry wall dust is such a fine powder that simply walking around in the work area stirs it up. Even after you’ve stopped sanding, the dust hangs in the air for quite a while. Walking through pushes it around in the air.


The more people walk through the area, the faster the dust will spread.
Restrict the work area to only others working on the project., Lay a mat in front of the entrance. A mat isn’t going to make a huge difference, but at the very least you can reduce tracking dust by wiping the soles of your shoes off before leaving the area.


If you’re doing work in your own home, removing your shoes and leaving them behind will help.

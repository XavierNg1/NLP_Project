 CompoundEyes' effect outside of battle makes wild Pokémon more likely to be holding items if the Pokémon is on top, even if it has fainted. However, make sure they are both at least Level 21 (in Platinum, 19 if you're playing Diamond/Pearl), because you will need it to make sure the Repels will prevent your Poke Radar from breaking streak.


If you're playing Diamond, it can be a little difficult to get a Frisker, because one of the Pokémon that gets Frisk (Stantler) can't be found in Diamond, while the other (Banette) can only be found at night. If you're playing Pearl or Platinum, though, you can get Stantler on Route 207 by using the Poke Radar. But if you can get a Banette, that's even better, since Chansey's Normal-type moves can't hit it.;
, Use a Repel (preferably Max), have the Poke Radar on Select, put the Pokémon with Compound Eyes on top (again, the effect works even if the Compound Eyes Pokémon is knocked out, in which case you can put the Frisker right behind it), and save your game.
 Afterwards, bring out the Pokémon with Frisk, and if it has Lucky Egg, either catch it or use Thief. If it doesn't, knock it out and repeat. Remember to take the Lucky Egg off after using Thief.


Beware other wild Pokémon other than Chansey that could break your streak, though.

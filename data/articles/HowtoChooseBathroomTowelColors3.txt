 If you’re upgrading your towels, make sure you buy a wide variety of sizes. Every bathroom should be equipped with bath towels, hand towels and face cloths, at the bare minimum.Bath towels are generally 27”x52” (69 x 132cm) and are preferred for wiping down after showers.
Bath sheets are 35”x60” (89 x 152cm) and are ideal for people who prefer a bit more towel coverage after a shower.
Hand towels are 16”x30” (41 x 76cm) and are everyday towels for wiping hands.
Face or wash cloths are 13”x13” (33 x 33cm) and are ideal for spot cleaning, in and out of the shower.
If you’re feeling extra ambitious, add bath sheets and finger towels to your shopping list.
Buy at least four of each size towel. You’ll want to have extras in case your towels are in the wash, or for when you have guests visiting.
 Bathmats are necessary for protecting your floors from shower moisture, but they can also be another source of color. Your bathmat should compliment your towel choices, but not replicate them exactly.If you are using patterned towels, buy a bathmat in one of your towel’s color tones.
Do not select a bathmat that is not washable. There are some beautiful non-washable bathmats out there, but they’re not practical for most bathrooms. Only purchase a non-washable bathmat if you don’t expect anyone to actually use the bath or shower in that particular bathroom.
 Top, seat covers and rug bases used to be very popular bathroom accessories, but they’re not terribly hygienic. Bathroom linens like these trap moisture, dust and bacteria and are therefore not recommended for use in your bathroom.Add some color around your toilet by adding some greenery in the form of a potted plant or succulent.
If you’d like to add additional color by your toilet, hang some fun art across from the toilet (but not so high that your guests will have to break their necks to look at it).

 Get a stone or wooden pressure plate, a command block, and an area to place these materials. To get a command block, type in this code to the chat: "/give (your minecraft username) minecraft:command_block 1".;
, Then place the command block in the hole.
 This will spawn TNT when the command block is activated.
,, Walk over the pressure plate (not the mine). If all goes well, it should have destroyedÂ the area near you.

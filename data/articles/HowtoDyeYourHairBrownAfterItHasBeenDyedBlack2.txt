 There are a few different color removing products out there. There are some that are for lightening and some for color removal. Choose the one that you like the most or that you think will fit your particular needs.


Some color removers use peroxide, such as L'Oreal Color Zap, while others are made with bleach like products in them, such as Effasol.
Keep in mind that color removers will not turn your hair back to your natural hair color. Once you are done using them, your hair will most likely be an orange or yellow blond color., The color removers come with two different products, a powder and an activator. For removing black, you need to mix the two products together. Once they are fully mixed, apply the mixture to your hair. Make sure you saturate all of your hair. Put your hair under a shower cap and wait for 15-60 minutes.If you have thick or long hair, you may need more than one box of product.
Since it had peroxide in it, it will have an unpleasant smell. Make sure your bathroom is ventilated and that you aren't wearing any clothes that you mind getting messed up.
You should always mix the shampoos in accordance to the directions on the box.
 Once you've waited, rinse the product fully from your hair. Once all of the product is out, use a deep conditioning treatment on it to alleviate any damage the peroxide did to your hair. Rinse out the conditioner and let it dry. The color should be light enough now that you can color it with the brown dye of your choice.Make sure you use this product with care. The chemicals aren't as strong as bleach, bu they can have a negative effect on your hair. If you already have brittle or dry hair, make sure you condition before you try this treatment.

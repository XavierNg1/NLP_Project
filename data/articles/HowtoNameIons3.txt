 Polyatomic ions are simply ions that contain more than one type of element. These are distinct from ionic compounds, which are formed when positively charged ions bond with negatively charged ions.As with ions, there is a system for naming ionic compounds.
 The naming system for polyatomic ions is quite complex, so you may want to start by memorizing the ones that you will need to recall most often.Common polyatomic ions include bicarbonate ion (HCO3-), hydrogen sulfate ion or bisulfate ion (HSO4-), acetate ion (CH3CO2-), perchlorate ion (ClO4-), nitrate ion (NO3-), chlorate ion (ClO3-), nitrite ion (NO2-), chlorite ion (ClO2-), permanganate ion (MnO4-), hypochlorite ion (ClO-), cyanide ion (CN-), hydroxide ion (OH-), carbonate ion (CO32-), peroxide ion (O22-), sulfate ion (SO42-), chromate ion (CrO42-), sulfite ion (SO32-), dichromate ion (Cr2O72-), thiosulfate ion (S2O32-), hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO42-), phosphate ion (PO43-), arsenate ion (AsO43-), and borate ion (BO33-)
The ammonium ion (NH4+), is the only positively charged polyatomic ion (or polyatomic cation)., Although complex, there is a pattern to the naming system for negatively charged polyatomic ions (or polyatomic anions). Once you understand the pattern, you will be able to name any ion.Use the -ite suffix to indicate a low oxidation state. For example, the NO2- ion is the nitrite ion.
Use the -ate suffix to indicate a high oxidation state. For example, the NO3- ion is the nitrate ion.
Use the hypo- prefix to indicate the very lowest oxidation state. For example, the ClO- ion is the hypochlorite ion.
Use the per- prefix (as in hyper-) to indicate the very highest oxidation state. For example, the ClO4- ion is the perchlorate ion.
Exceptions to the pattern include hydroxide (OH-), cyanide (CN-), and peroxide (O22-) ions, which have the -ide ending because they were once thought to be monatomic ions.

 For an object falling through the Earth's atmosphere, the density is going to change based on the altitude and the temperature of the air. This makes calculating terminal velocity of a falling object especially difficult, as the density of the air will change as the object loses altitude. However, you can look up approximate air densities in textbooks and other references.As a rough guide, the density of air at sea level when the temperature is 15 °C is 1.225 kg/m3.
 This number is based on how streamlined the object is. Unfortunately it is a very complex number to compute, and involves making certain scientific assumptions. Do not attempt to calculate drag coefficient yourself without the help of a wind tunnel and some serious aerodynamic math. Instead look up an approximation based on a similarly shaped object., The last variable you need to know is the sectional area being presented by the object to the medium. Imagine the silhouette of the falling object seeing when looking up from directly beneath it. That shape, projected onto a plane, is the projected area. Again, this is a difficult value to calculate with anything but simple geometric objects.
 If you know the velocity of the object, but not the drag force, you can use the formula to calculate the drag force. This is (C*ρ*A*(v^2))/2.

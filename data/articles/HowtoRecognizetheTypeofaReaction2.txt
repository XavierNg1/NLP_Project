 A decomposition reaction is one where a reactant degrades or decomposes into its constituent parts. This type of reaction yields more products than reactants. Almost all basic decomposition reactions will have one reactant.The reactant is on the left side of the arrow.
 The reactant decomposes into multiple products. To recognize this type of reaction, just see if the equation resembles the general formula C --> A + B. Remember, the products are on the right side of the arrow.This reaction is the opposite of a combination reaction.
 Being able to recognize equations comes with practice. The more equations you look at, the easier it will be for you to immediately realize the reaction is decomposition.Example 1: 2H2O â†’ 2H2 + O2

Example 2: KClO3 --> KCl + O2

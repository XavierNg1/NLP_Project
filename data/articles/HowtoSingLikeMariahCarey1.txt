, Carey tends to pull into airy tones sometimes after hitting high notes. However, only use these sparingly, as most voice coaches consider this a vocal weakness. Carey backs hers up with strong, belted notes that phase into airy tones.Most amateur singers have no trouble with airy notes, as airy notes are created by improper technique. It's the strong, belted notes that are more difficult.
 Belting is the ability to pull your chest voice into your head voice.Separate your chest voice from your head voice. Your chest voice is your mid-range voice. You'll notice the vibrations from singing are mostly in your chest. As you go higher in your range, you'll feel your head voice kick in, as the sound moves from the front of your mouth to the back.Choose a space where you can make as much noise as you want. Relax any tension in your shoulders by taking some deep breaths.Lower your jaw, and lift your soft palate.The soft palate is the roof of your mouth. Lifting the soft palate creates a better, more resonant sound. Using a mirror, say "hung-ah," and see how your palate moves. You should be able to feel what you need to do to lift the soft palate.Use less air as you move to the higher notes.Pull the sound forward to the front of your face., Though Carey does employ a breathy tone at times, she has a very clear, resonant tone most of the time.One way to develop a clear tone is to practice "saying" different words at certain pitches. It's easier to hear how to clarify the tone when your speaking the words, and it crosses over into singing.

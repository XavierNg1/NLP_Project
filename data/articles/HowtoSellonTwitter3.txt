 Do you want to babysit? Mow lawns? Organize and clean rooms? The choice is yours, but be sure you're happy with it, because once you begin advertising, it's hard to change your mind.
 Obviously, you won't be able to mow lawns if you don't know how to start a lawnmower. Talk to your parents or a friend if you need help to do what you're thinking of. Some services, such as babysitting, will even have classes offered by local colleges, schools, or other facilities.
 If you're raking leaves, provide your own rake; don't mooch off the person who is using your services. Be sure that whatever you need, you can take with you.
 Once you're completely ready, let Twitter know that you're selling services. If you want, you can start a hashtag for your 'business', like #Milly'sSmartphoneRepairs or #123babysitting so that users can start a post with your hashtag to request services.
 If you'll only be able to work during the summer or on weekends, let your followers know in the post. It will prevent your customers from getting refused without warning.

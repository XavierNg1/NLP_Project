 Some people say that “the practice is the performance.” In other words, the real work is the training, not the race itself. You'll probably experience some last minute nervousness, but don't let that push you into a negative mindset.
 Think through your strategy to help you accomplish your goals. However, remember to have a flexible mindset as well. The course may not look exactly like you had pictured, you might not realize how other runners could affect your own performance, and the weather may change your race experience.


Approach your race day with an open mind and excitement, rather than with a set of rigid expectations about the race details or your performance.
 After becoming familiar with the racecourse, think about split or pacing goals for each section of the race.Mentally prepare for how you may feel at each stage of the race and have a plan for overcoming any negative feelings.


Have a plan for dealing with hills, your shoe coming untied, feeling overtired, etc. If you have a plan ahead of time, it will be easier to deal with the unexpected.Do not change your plan or goals at the last minute., If you feel jittery or nervous, do some breathing exercises to help calm your nerves. You want to feel relaxed before a race.Take a deep breath in through your nose, counting to 6 and allowing your diaphragm to expand. Then slowly breathe out through your mouth, counting to 7 and allowing all of your breath to completely leave your chest. Pause a few seconds and repeat 10 times.

 The type of book chosen and how it is read depends on the grade level. For example, fifth graders might read a chapter-book that won a Newberry metal, while 2nd graders would have a picture book read to them. This project is for all ages.;
, Give the students paper to draw on if they don't already have it. Inform the students that they can draw pictures related to the main character, conflict, etc. It is completely up to them.
 This, of course, should be the student's job. Use a hole-puncher to poke holes in the top of the colored and cut out pictures. Have them tie a string through the hole at the top of the picture. Attach the pictures to a skewer or clothes hanger.
 If you have empty space in the hallway or the classroom, hang the mobiles on the wall. Displaying the students' work will most likely make the students proud and happy. Also, you can show off to the other classes!

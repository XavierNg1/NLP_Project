 This may prevent your kid from patting your dog too hard or hurting them unintentionally.


Take hold of your child's hand, then use it to gently pet the dog. This will help your child better understand the petting process.



Have your kid throw toys and balls away from the dog instead of at the dog. Your kid will understand how to play fetch when the dog begins to chase the object, then brings it back for additional play.
 Your dog may become irritable and angry with your child if your child pesters them during sleeping and eating.
 Your dog may become upset and uncomfortable with certain types of roughhousing behavior; such as ear-pulling or jumping onto the dog while they are resting.
 This will help establish a trusting, friendly relationship between your children and the dog.


Engage your children in bathing or combing your dog, or providing them with food and water on a regular basis.

 With an overdraft protection plan, the bank will dip into a backup account when your checking account can’t cover the check. The second account might be any of the following:savings account
credit card
home equity line of credit

, Typically, you will still be charged a fee for transferring money out of your backup account into your checking account. For example, you might be charged a $12.50 fee for a transfer.This fee is typically lower than a non-sufficient funds fee or an overdraft charge, but it is rarely free.


If your backup account is a line of credit, you will also be charged interest rate for the loan until you pay it back.Find out how much you are charged each day.
 If you’re bouncing checks because you don’t have enough money, then an overdraft protection plan is a temporary measure. You can’t deplete your backup account and continue to overspend.


If you do, then there won’t be any money to cover your check. The bank can refuse to clear the check and charge you a non-sufficient funds fee. Alternately, the bank could clear the check but charge you an overdraft fee.
You might use a credit card or credit line as your backup account. However, you'll need to pay the money back. If you don't, then interest will compound and you'll find yourself deep in debt.

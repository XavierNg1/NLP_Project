 Choosing well-lit streets to ride on is the best way to guarantee that you are visible to motorists at night. Opt for main streets in commercial areas, which are likely to have bright street lights to accommodate pedestrian traffic. Streets with restaurants, bars, cafes, and movie theatres are especially likely to be brightly lit throughout the night., To stay visible to pedestrians and motorists, stay 3-4 four feet away from the curb. The same applies to parked cars - keeping 3-4 feet away will prevent an accidents caused by a driver opening their car door in front of you. The distance will also offer a buffer against drivers pulling out of their parking spaces suddenly., Ride your bike in areas with designated bicycle lanes. You are more likely to be visible to drivers in an area where they are expecting you. Move a little further into the bicycle lane to make yourself easier to spot by drivers approaching from behind.

 The concrete around pools can injure your dog’s paws. If your dog runs around the pool while your family is in it, they may cut their paws on sharp and uneven stones, rocks, or the hard concrete. They may also burn their paws on the hot concrete.Your dog may also wear down their nails on the hard surface around the pool, and they can injure their paws on the pool steps by jumping into the pool.
 Try to keep your dog from drinking too much from the pool. This can cause them to get sick. You can’t keep your dog from swallowing some water, but discourage them drinking from the pool by placing fresh, cool water near the pool for them., During the summer, dogs may play in pools with their owners, or they may play around the yard while their family enjoys the pool. Being active and outside in the hot sun all day can put your dog at a higher risk for heat stroke. Signs of heat stroke include:Excessive or loud panting
A bright red tongue and red gums
Drooling excessively
Thick saliva
Extreme thirst
Skin around muzzle or neck doesn't snap back when pinched
Increased heart rate
Vomiting
If you suspect your dog has heat stroke, take them to the vet.

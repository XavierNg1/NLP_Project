 After deadheading your mums, it’s important to get rid of the dead blooms, branches or stems that you have taken off in the process. Pests like slugs and snails can lay their eggs in the dead foliage and overtake the mum, which will harm the plant., A good time to mulch your plant is after deadheading and pinching because it can add nourishment to the soil and protect the vulnerable plant against cold spells. Add a few inches of lightweight mulch in the spring or summer after deadheading, and add mulch in mid to late fall to protect mums against the winter., Mums need plenty of sun, and it’s a good idea to give them the nourishment they need right after pruning. After deadheading an indoor mum, bring it to a sunny windowsill. Try to time the deadheading of outdoor mums so that it receives at least a few hours of sunlight after the deadheading process.

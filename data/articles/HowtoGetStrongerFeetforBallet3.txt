 Sit on the floor and place one foot into the stretcher. Straighten your knee, slowly, until you feel a push on the top of your foot.Do this exercise once a day for a couple of minutes and gradually add on over time.


Take care not to overstretch your foot. You should never feel more than a small amount of pressure while stretching. If your foot gets overstretched, take a break from stretching for a few days.
Foot stretchers are available online or you can make your own. Take a sanded piece of wood (about two times the length of your foot) and use a glue gun to glue a sock around the circumference of the wood. Take a Thera-Band (which you can buy online) and tie it in a knot a fist’s width away from your sock. Slip your toes through the knot in the Thera-Band and rest your heel on the sock to stretch out your foot., Sit on the floor with your legs outstretched. Point your toe, then slowly lift just the toes up and then point your toes again. Do three sets of twelve every day to achieve maximum results with this exercise.Make sure to isolate your toes from the rest of your feet, so the only part of your foot that is moving is your toes.Focus on keeping your leg straight as well. Do not let it rock from side to side.
 To do this exercise, you will need twenty marbles and a bowl. Place the marbles on the floor and then take a seat next to them. One by one, pick the marbles up with your toes and place them into the bowl.This exercise is especially helpful if you’re having pain in the ball of your foot or cramps in your toes.

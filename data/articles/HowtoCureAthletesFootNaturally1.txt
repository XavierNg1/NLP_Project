 Athlete’s foot manifests in three general varieties. “Toe web infection” generally begins with pale, moist-looking skin. The skin usually itches or burns, and may smell unusual. It is usually fairly easy to treat.This type of infection usually occurs between your fourth and fifth (or “pinky”) toes.As the infection progresses, the skin between your toes may develop scales, cracks, or begin peeling. In severe cases, a bacterial infection may also occur. This bacterial infection can extend to the lower leg if left untreated, causing a condition called cellulitis.Toe web infections may also cause sudden blisters to form.;
, The vesicular variety of athlete’s foot usually starts with a crop of red, inflamed, fluid-filled blisters on your feet, often on the soles.This condition can begin as an untreated toe web infection.This variety is usually treatable at home.


In more severe cases, a bacterial condition can also develop.
You may also develop blisters on your palms, sides of your fingers, or other areas of skin that have come into contact with your feet., The “moccasin” variety of athlete’s foot causes the skin on your feet, especially on the sole or heel, to become dry, irritated, and itchy. This variety can become chronic and is very hard to treat.Other signs of the moccasin variety are burning, thickening of the skin, and cracking of the skin. In extreme cases, your toenails can develop the infection and thicken, fall apart, or fall off. You have to treat fungal infection of the toenails separately.

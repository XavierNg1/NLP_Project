 Make one column for each day of the week, starting with Sunday and ending with Saturday. Use a ruler to make the seven days even and the lines straight.;
, You can either write them out or use stickers. It all depends on the look you want to achieve. Remember to keep it simple so kids can read it easily. A calendar that is filled with too many stickers and colors will be distracting.
 It helps to color the columns so the calendar is easier to read visually. Use the colours of the rainbow if you like (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, or pink). You can use light crayons or colored pencils, making sure that you don't color in the boxes too dark, or you won't be able to write over them.
 This is the fun part. You can use pictures from the internet or magazines to fill your calendar with your kid's daily schedule. If you have older kids, then use labels and just print the activity on them. This calendar lets your kids look at the day and know what is going to happen (school, afterschool activities, or chores). It works wonders for visual learners or kids who need to have a structured routine. It is also a great way for them to keep track of school clubs and library days. Here are some ideas:


For example, at the top of each column, you can write the word "school" or place a picture of a school, or you can even use your kid's school logo if you wish.
Then you can add pictures or symbols of your kid's activities.
You can even include a picture of a pile of laundry for laundry day.
 Pick an area such as a playroom, kitchen, or laundry room. Your children will benefit greatly from this tool.
 This can include reading at night, Friday nights with Grandma, or a number of endless possibilities. The most important thing is that you have fun with it.

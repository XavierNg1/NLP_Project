 The area of any rectangle (remember, squares are special rectangles) is defined as its base times its height.Since the base and the height of a square are the same length, the area of a square with side length s is s*s, or A = s2.
 The square root of the area will give you the length of one of the sides of the square. For most numbers, you will need to use a calculator to find the square root, by first typing in the value of the area, followed by the square root (√) key. You can also learn to Calculate a Square Root by Hand!


If the area of your square is 20, then the side length s =√20, or 4.472.
If the area of the square is 25, then s = √25, or 5.
 Take the side length s you just calculated and plug it into the perimeter formula, P = 4s. The result will be the perimeter of your square!


For the square with area 20 and side length 4.472, the perimeter P = 4 * 4.472, or 17.888.
For the square with area 25 and side length 5, P = 4 * 5, or 20.

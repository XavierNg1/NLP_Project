 Pick up a map of tour from a visitor’s center or your hotel. Circle the spots that you want to see, and determine the best route to get between these points. Be sure to measure how far it is between each spot, so that you are not walking too far.


For example, you may want to start at Times Square, then walk down Broadway to 34th Street to see the Empire State building. From there, you can go up Fifth Avenue to see the New York Public Library. You can turn down 49th street to end at Rockefeller Plaza.It may be easier to limit yourself to a single neighborhood or area, especially if you have never been to New York before. This will help you make the most of your time while reducing the chance you get lost.
 To give yourself the same information about your landmarks as a professional tour, you can buy a guidebook. This book can tell you all of the same interesting facts, stories, and histories that you would learn on a professional tour. There are many guidebooks that are designed for self-guided walking tours. You can ask someone at your hotel for advice, or you can stop by a news kiosk or bookstore.
 Another option is to download a walking app on your phone. Some apps can help you track your path via GPS. Others offer audio guides. Apps can be a cheaper option to guidebooks.


Central Park’s official app can guide you around the park with audio commentary.
UrbanWonderer and iTourMobile offer free audio tours on Android and Apple devices.

The New York Times offers an app called The Scoop that offers suggestions on places to see and visit., Since you will be guiding your own tour, you will be responsible for making sure that you do not go over your allotted time. If you have a busy schedule, you should keep an eye on how long it takes you to go between places. If you are running short on time, you may have to reduce how long you spend at each landmark.

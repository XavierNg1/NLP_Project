 If vertigo hits, the worst thing you can do is to change your position quickly. Reduce your feelings of dizziness by moving very slowly - we’re talking sloth’s pace. These slow movements will allow you to focus more easily and clear your head a bit better. If you need to, take short breaks between slow movements.;
, As with regular non-vertigo produced dizziness, looking up or down can cause further disorientation and feelings of unpleasantness. Avoid performing any activities that require you to look up or down for a long period of time or quickly. Keep your head level and parallel to the ground whenever possible.
 As a result of human perception, things close up seem to move faster whereas things far away move as if through molasses. Therefore, focus on something in the distance until your dizziness recedes. If necessary, look out a window to do so.
 It may seem obvious, but repetitive movements will worsen your vertigo by shaking up your balance. Keep your movements deliberate and steady in addition to slow and you should notice an alleviation of your vertigo pretty quickly.

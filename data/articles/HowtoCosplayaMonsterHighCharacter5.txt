 Deuce Gorgon has a cool personality, be loyal to your friends and girlfriend (if you have one). Jackson Jekyll has a sort of nerdy personality, get straight A's and study a lot. Holt Hyde has a party personality. Learn to play the electric guitar! Offer to be DJ in the school dance! Have a rocking personality. Clawd has a very big heart and, like Deuce, is loyal to his friends and definitely his girlfriend! he also is very intelligent and athletic. (So, athletic, smart and loyal-like a wolf!), Deuce would wear something a normal guy would wear, with a skater twist. Jackson would wear plaid, dress shirts and light wash jeans (no rips please!) Holt would wear loud and flashy clothes.
 Don't change your hair much, even though you can have a new haircut inspired by the guy's hair if you want.,

 If you tried the free methods already (which you should), you've likely already found advertisements for these services. Start by only trying the free services; these are unlikely to work but are an easy first step.



Do not sign up for any free trial that asks for your credit card number or other personal information.
 Many "reverse cell phone database" websites that charge a fee to conduct the search will try to scam you or give you unhelpful information. Enter false or familiar phone numbers to test for accuracy. Search for a couple random strings of numbers (in the correct phone number format). If the search still comes up with "results", especially GPS location, it's likely a scam or joke site.Similarly, you can enter your own phone number and see if the results are accurate.
Search for reviews of the company. An online search for the company name can reveal complaints from scammed customers. For a more official perspective, you can search the better business bureau directory for detailed records of the company's response to customer complaints.
 These sites typically run the same searches you did when you tried the free methods, so paying money is very unlikely to turn up new results and may result in your information being stolen or your credit card overcharged.
 Even after you've tried all the above options, you will often still not have the information you need. Hiring a private investigator is an expensive option, and you'll want to research several options before selecting one. Make sure you get an estimate and detailed information on terms before you hire anyone. A refund is often available in the event the investigator fails to find the information you're looking for, but ask about this in advance.

 The most common way to use olive oil to remove scars is to simply massage it into your skin. Use only a drop or so of olive oil and apply it to troublesome areas.


Move your finger tips in small circles to massage the oil into scarred skin. Use deep pressure and massage for 4 to 5 minutes.
Once your skin's pores absorb some of the olive oil, use a clean paper towel to wipe the excess oil off your skin.
Repeat this process again. When you finish for the second time, let the oil sit on your skin for 15 to 20 minutes.
Do this twice a day and see if you see any improvement.;
, If you're mainly worried about scars on your face, you can try using a facial steam to clear your skin. Facial steams are fairly easy to do at home with only a few supplies and they work by opening the pores to release sweat and debris. This can help the overall health of skin and lessen the appearance of scars.


Put a pot of water on the stove and wait for it to steam. Do not allow the water to get so hot it's boiling, however, as this can burn your skin. Just wait until it's producing steam.
Add a few drops of olive oil to the water and stir. Wrap a towel around your head and lean over the pot. Keep your face about 18 inches away from the water. Any closer could cause discomfort.
Stand over the steam for 8 to 10 minutes. Then, remove the towel and wipe off your face, neck, and shoulders.
 You can make a scrub using olive oil to exfoliate your skin. This can remove the dead skin cells that cause scars, resulting in smoother looking skin.


Mix a tablespoon of baking soda with a tablespoon of olive oil. Rub this onto your skin using your fingertips, paying special attention to any acne scars.
Rub for about 3 to 4 minutes. Then, use a wet cloth to wipe the mixture from your face.

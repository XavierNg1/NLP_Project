 You may want to choose a system that uses sound to create a barrier for your dog. This device will emit a high-pitched sound that is unpleasant to dogs, so it will deter them from getting close to off-limits areas.These sounds will not be heard by most humans.
 Another system you can use is a spray barrier. This type of device will create a barrier by spraying a mist into the air around the boundary of the area that dogs wonâ€™t like. This will discourage the dog from entering the area., Static barrier devices are another option to keep dogs from certain areas. This device creates electrical pulses that the dog can feel on the skin. It will tingle unpleasantly, which will help your dog learn not to go into certain areas.Different devices have different levels of static pulses. You can also get them that send the static pulse to a dog collar, or get a device that puts the static pulse in a mat you place near the off-limits area. You can choose one that is right for your pet.
This method may not be right for everyone.

 Once you’ve mastered the basics, practice other snares, hi-hats, and basslines. Practice each new sound individually until you execute them perfectly. This way you’ll have a wider array of sounds with which to create more diverse patterns.


Expand your snare sounds with the tongue snare with lungs (“C”), the “pff” or lip snare (“P”), and the techno snare (“G.”)
For hi-hats, try the open “tssss” snare (“S”) and successive hi-hats (‘tk”).
For bass, learn the bumskid bass drum (“JB”), the strong bass drum (“B”), the sweeping bass drum (“X”), and the techno bass drum (“U”)

, Once you’re comfortable using the basic sounds in more complex patterns, incorporate the new sounds you’ve learned. Attempt more advanced patterns, like this:


S |----|K---|----|K---||----|K---|----|K---| 
H |-tk-|-tk-|tk-t|-tkt||-tk-|-tk-|tkSS|--tk| 
B |B--b|---B|--B-|----||B--b|---B|--B-|----|

, Beatboxing is featured in a variety of music: hip-hop, R&B, house, techno, and more. The way it’s used in each style varies as well. Listen to a wide sampling from each and study both the obvious and subtle differences between them. Perform those beats yourself to better understand how each genre varies from one to the next.
 With a wider variety of sounds and a better understanding of genre, decide on a style of music and compose your own pattern. Take baby-steps: beat by beat, bar by bar. Pay attention to your own sense of rhythm and build on that. Keep your pattern clean and uncluttered so you can execute it perfectly; it’s better to adhere to the basics than to attempt more than you can physically perform at the moment.

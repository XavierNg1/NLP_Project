 Pour your juice into a champagne flute or similar glass. Fill the glass less than halfway full with your juice, as you'll be adding more of your carbonated beverage., After adding your juice, add your carbonated beverage to your mimosa. Strive for a rough ratio of two parts juice to three parts of your carbonated beverage.For example, if you added a quarter cup (60 mL) of juice, you would add half a cup (120 mL) of your carbonated beverage.
 Mimosas are generally not stirred.They should mix well enough during pouring, and stirring may cause carbonation to become flat.

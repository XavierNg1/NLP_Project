 You'll need milk, china grass (commonly known as "Kadal Paasi" in Tamil, also called agar-agar), Sarsaparilla syrup (called "Nannaari Syrup" in Tamil) or rose syrup, and vanilla ice cream.
 This will thicken the milk to help the taste and texture of the drink. Boil until the milk has been reduced to half its original volume and has turned a pale yellow color. Then let the milk cool, and refrigerate to chill it., Soak it in water for about three hours, or until it looks like pieces of jelly. Once it reaches this point, remove it from the water., Fill about half of a large glass with the reduced milk. Mix the Sarsaparilla syrup and china grass into the milk, stirring well to combine the flavors. Then top with a scoop of ice cream and enjoy.

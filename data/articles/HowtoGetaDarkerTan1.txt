 Doing both of these things will make your tan last longer, and you will tan better too. You also shouldn’t shower for four hours after using tanning lotion, so your tan won’t fade.


Working out before you tan is another way that you can tan faster. This is because working out will increase blood circulation, which will allow for better tanning.
To hydrate your skin, you should drink a lot of water throughout the day. Keeping your skin moisturized with lotion will also prevent it from fading after you’ve already gained the tan.;
, This means you remove dead skin cells from the outer layer of your skin, allowing for a better tan.Exfoliating will also get rid of any patches of rougher skin, improving the overall look of your skin. You can exfoliate with a loofah, an exfoliating mitten, and with exfoliating scrubs.Apply the exfoliating scrub in small, circular motions all over to help remove dead skin cells and smooth the skin's surface. This will help to ensure a more even tan and help to make your tan last longer.
 If you tan the wrong way, you’re going to end up with a severe burn, not a dark, good-looking tan. So do it the right way, and protect your skin.Your skin will be less susceptible to burning if you’re already tan or have spent a lot of time in the sun.Watch the degree of time you spend out in the sun. Too much sun exposure can make you sick and result in a severe burn, not a darker tan. Any tan not from a lotion or spray must be obtained gradually and with proper sunscreen.
Don’t use baby oil to tan. It can cause a severe burn. Always use an SPF lotion or spray, preferably factor 15 or over. Contrary to popular belief, this will not stop you from tanning; it will simply help to protect the skin from UV damage, including drying, premature aging and even skin cancer.

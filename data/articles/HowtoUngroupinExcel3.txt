 If your data was grouped with the “Group” button then it was done manually. Groups are sometimes created automatically by functions, like Subtotal, which can be identified by a “Subtitle” row under the grouped data.
 This is located in the top menu bar and will bring up a set of data-specific controls.
 This button is on the right of the data toolbar in the "Outline" section and will bring up a dialog box.
 This button is in the lower left of the dialog box and will ungroup all data and remove the subtotals.

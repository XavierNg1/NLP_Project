 With this method, you can print out a template that has a great amount of detail. It will take longer, but you'll be able to include as much detail as you'd like.


Place it on the table. Clear a space much wider than the paper on your surface.
 Make sure it's covered on all sides and the template can't move around underneath.


If you seem to be having issues, tape the edges of the template down to the table, too.
 It should be much bigger on all sides than your template. It does not have to be perfectly centered; it just has to be bigger.


If you don't have tulle, you can use sheer fabric. Know that tulle is stiffer and easier to work with it.
 For your first mask, you may want to stick to one color. Be careful not to rest the edge on your hand on the template, smearing the paint.


If you do use more than one color, be aware that the colors may run a bit together where they meet.
Let it dry overnight.
 Gently peel the tulle off the table, making sure everything is dry first. Carefully cut out the edges of the mask and the eyeholes.
 Cut two pieces of ribbon 20â€³ each. Spread a little fabric glue on the tips and attach them to the mask. Let dry 1-2 hours.


You can trim the strands shorter if you like, just make sure it will tie around your head before cutting!

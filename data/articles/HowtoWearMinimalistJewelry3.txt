 A lariat is a long necklace that ends in a single chain that drops down from the middle of the necklace. It usually has a small pendant on the end. While you can wear a lariat with any number of blouses, another way you can wear one is to turn the necklace around so that the pendant is in the back. This technique works best with shirts and dresses that are low-cut in the back., While you want simplicity and clean lines with minimalist jewelry, stacking a few minimalist pieces for a statement piece can create an interesting effect. For instance, you could wear a small choker with a delicate chain necklace, or stack several rings or bracelets for a statement. Just keep in mind that you really want just one big statement piece, so don't go overboard with necklaces, bracelets, AND big earrings., If you do wear stacked pieces or multiple pieces, mixing materials can add texture and interest to your look. For instance, you could have a choker made out of leather along with a dainty gold necklace., You may think charms are the exact opposite of minimalist, and if you're talking about a standard charm bracelet, you'd be right. However, wearing a small charm or two on a dainty chain necklace can bring meaning to your jewelry without adding too much bulk.

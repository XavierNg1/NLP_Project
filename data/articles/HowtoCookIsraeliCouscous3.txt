 Pour the oil into a large saucepan and heat it on the stove over medium heat.


For an even more flavorful twist, use lemon-flavored olive oil.
 Stir continually until the couscous and nuts toast to a light golden brown.


Stir the couscous and nuts continuously to prevent them from burning.
Toasting the couscous and nuts will enhance their flavor. Most nuts will work well, but almonds or pistachios are among the best to consider. For a change, though, you could try pine nuts, macadamia nuts, or mixed nuts.
 Bring the contents of the pan to a boil.


Stir well to distribute the salt and pepper throughout the toasted couscous and nuts.
 Reduce the heat and cover, cooking until the couscous has absorbed all the liquid in the skillet.


Stir the couscous gently, pulling it up from the center to the sides of the pan. If liquid seeps down into the center of the pan, you need to cook the couscous a little longer to absorb the remaining liquid.
Note that the overall cooking time can vary by brand. Follow the package instructions to determine the proper amount of time.
 Toss the dried apricots, golden raisins, parsley, and mint into the cooked couscous and stir to distribute throughout.


You could also change up the dried fruits in this recipe. For instance, you could use standard raisins, dried tart cherries, dried cranberries, or dried figs.
 Transfer the couscous to serving dishes and sprinkle each serving with a little cinnamon or a drizzle of lemon juice.Alternatively, you could serve the couscous without any garnish.

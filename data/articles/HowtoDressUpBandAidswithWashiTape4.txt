 In some cases, engaging your child in a small craft will take his or her mind off any injury and bring the focus back to something fun.


Find a shoebox or larger empty tin to keep your supplies. Include a pair of sharp scissors in addition to the Band Aids and assortment of Washi tape.
, Then allow your child to apply it to the Band-Aid independently (or with your assistance if needed).
 Your child will delight in wearing the self-created pretty Band-Aids.

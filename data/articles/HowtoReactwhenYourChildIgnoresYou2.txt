 Know when to engage with your child and when to refrain. Though it is never okay for your child to ignore you, know that sometimes they should get a pass. If they are crying or very upset about something, for instance, you might choose to let it go. However, in all other instances you should not tolerate being ignored and disrespected.Call attention to the behavior, give a warning, and then follow through with a punishment if they don’t listen.
 Many children respond better when there is a degree of flexibility offered. Perhaps you need your child to take out the trash or clean the bathroom. Rather than saying “Zach, clean the bathroom right now,” which might get you ignored, say “I need you to clean the bathroom before 8PM tonight.”This way, your child can finish up any tasks they are in the process of so they can devote more attention to their chores.
 Tasks like homework should be completed at a certain time of day to establish a routine. Avoid giving your child a lot of flexibility about when they will complete tasks like these. Tell them to put away the electronics while they work.You will avoid being ignored if your child knows the exact time of day that they are supposed to do something; this will prevent you from having to remind them.

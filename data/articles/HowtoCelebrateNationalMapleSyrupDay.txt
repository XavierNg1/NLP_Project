, Make a peanut butter sandwich, only add maple syrup instead of jelly.
 Try it for the sweetener in your favorite recipe for muffins, baked beans or barbecue sauce, too. If you're replacing crystalline sugar, reduce the other liquid a bit.
 Try topping ice cream with it, making a layer of syrup in cakes, and dipping Twinkies or other light cakes in it.

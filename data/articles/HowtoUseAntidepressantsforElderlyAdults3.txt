 One month after you start taking SSRIs, you need to have your sodium levels checked. SSRIs can cause hypnoatremia, which is a condition where your blood sodium level is abnormally low.Make sure your doctor checks your sodium levels when you go in for a check up if you have been prescribed SSRIs or if your dosage has changed.


This is especially necessary if you are also on other medications that can cause hyonoatremia, such as diruetics., If your doctor places you on tricyclic antidepressants, you should keep an eye out for additional side effects of these medications. You are at an increased risk of blood toxicity, even if you are on a low dose of the medication. This is especially problematic if you slowly metabolize medication.


Before you start taking them or if your dosage is increased, you should also have your blood pressure checked and you should have a ECG.SSRI’s have become the first line treatment for depressive symptoms. If possible, try to avoid TCA’s. Some side effects of TCA’s include the risk for cardiac toxicity, CNS toxicity, and anticholinergic toxicity.
 When an elderly adult is given antidepressants, the dosing may need to be adjusted. The low dose that most antidepressants are started at with elderly adults may not give them the therapeutic effect needed from the antidepressants.


If you find that you or a loved one are not receiving the right help from the medication, ask your doctor about a possible change in dosage.

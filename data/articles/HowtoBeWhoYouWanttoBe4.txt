 Other people may want you to be someone who you are not. They may ask things of you that make you uncomfortable, anxious, or burdened. Realizing that not everyone will like you is liberating, as it allows you to take care of your own needs. Put your own happiness first. This does not mean you have to be selfish; rather, it is a simple awareness that by taking care of yourself, you are better positioned to take care of other people., Being who you want to be means taking responsibility for your actions. By realizing that you can change, you also realize that you have control over your own actions. While other people may try to stop you or obstruct your dreams, you have the power to ignore them and to make your own choices.
 Every day, remind yourself of what makes you a great person. You can do this by praising yourself in the mirror or by writing down positive notes to yourself. Higher positivity leads to higher confidence, and it will help you become more comfortable in your individual personality.
 Don't be surprised if old friends and acquaintances don't support you. Some people will try to convince you that it's just not possible to change. They may even try to make you feel guilty for trying. Donâ€™t argue with people who criticize your choices.


Simply say something like, "I was unhappy before, and I am working towards being a better person."
You can also say, "Thank you for your concern. No matter who I become, I will always love you."
If you have a friend or loved one who still bothers you about the changes you are making, then you may want to take some time away from the person.

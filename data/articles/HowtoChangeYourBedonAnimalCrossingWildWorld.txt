 There are many ways to do this, for example:

Go to Tom Nook's and find one there.
At the acorn festival, give Cornimer 150 acorns (find them under trees), and he will give you a 'Mush bed.'
Shake trees, to find furniture and check if it is a bed.;
,, It will ask you if you want to change it, press 'Yes', it will then go to your pockets., Now you can sleep in your new bed!

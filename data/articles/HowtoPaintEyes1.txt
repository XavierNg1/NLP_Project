 Drawing is a great practice for any aspiring painter. Drawing helps flush out the design properties before taking the design to paint. While drawing and painting are different mediums, the fundamentals are the same., If you want plenty of images and ideas, search google images for eyes and you’ll find more than you can swallow. Immerse yourself for inspiration. If you have a mirror nearby your canvas, then you have the best source for eyes: your own!

, Before going into the long lengths of planning and executing a painting of eyes, try messing around first. A great way to find your style is by doodling. Create a bunch of eyes in a quick manner. The point is to not think about what your drawing; that will come later., Look through the progression of eyes you drew and see how they matured. Select the eye you are most proud of. Don’t necessarily select the eye that most resembles an eye. Instead select an eye that looks best to you.
 Take out a pen or pencil and try your hand at recreating the eye you’re most proud of. Spend a little more time reformulating this eye as to when you were quickly doodling. Try to fill up a page in your sketchbook.


Look over your work and select the eye you are most proud of., Now spend more time recreating the latest eye. This time around, spend more attention to the details of the eye. Incorporate more details into your doodle. This is when you could start looking at real life eyes for inspiration. Incorporate as much detail into the framework you’ve created., Now draw an eye that is a simplified version of the detailed eye you just drew. Draw this onto canvas or whatever you choose to paint onto. This will act as the outline for the eyes you're about to paint.

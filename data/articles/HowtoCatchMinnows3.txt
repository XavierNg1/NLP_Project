 Minnow seines are a popular netting technique that generate many minnows without waiting all day or night. Certain fishing brands market these exclusively as “minnow seines.” Visit an outdoor store that has a fishing department or order one off the internet.Smaller seines work better for creeks.
 Gather two wooden boards that are about four feet tall. Use a saw to cut a sharp angle at the bottom of each board. Tie the seine to the top and bottom of each board.


You can also staple the seine or net to the wooden boards., Search for a spot along a moving body of water like a stream or creek. Creeks will have a larger population of minnows. Check a map to locate creeks that feed into a larger body of water.
 Locate an area of the body of water where the water flows above or around natural objects like rocks. Stick the boards with the seine attached into the creek using the sharper edges.
 Keep hold of the net while both the stream and creatures enter your contraption. Keep an eye out for schools of minnows as you stabilize the seine and support boards., After 10 to 15 minutes, lift the seine out of the water. Grip the bottom of the seine and meet it with the top of the seine. You should have an abundant supply of creatures caught in your net.


Try again if you didn’t catch any minnows. Be sure to align the bottom of the seine with the bottom of the creek's floor.
Relocate if you are still having troubles.
 Transfer the caught fish into your large cooler. Go through the fish that you caught and make sure that there isn’t any larger fish in the cooler. It’s okay if you caught other bait fish like a crayfish or a shiner.

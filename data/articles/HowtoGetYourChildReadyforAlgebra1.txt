 Some educational researchers, such as Dr. Herman Epstein, believe the human brain has periods of rapid development and periods where little development occurs, one of which coincides with a physical growth spurt during the ages 14 to 17, the high school years.;
, Your child should show some general problem-solving skills, be able to draw conclusions from logical reasoning, and be able to organize projects.
 Historically in American schools, algebra was introduced in either the 9th or 10th grade. Due to political pressures resulting in part from the No Child Left Behind Act, many school districts have formally introduced algebra in the 8th grade, with preliminary concepts taught in 7th grade.


If you homeschool your child, look at the curricula from several districts in your immediate area for a better handle on when might be an appropriate time to start preparing your child for algebra.
 You can do this in 1 of 2 ways:


Through a formal algebra readiness test. Many school districts offer algebra readiness tests as a means of placing students in study tracks for their high school years. These tests are usually offered during a student's middle school years. Organizations such as College Preparatory Mathematics and Sylvan Learning offer online or downloadable algebra readiness tests.
By regularly reviewing your child's math homework. Use the information presented under "Prerequisites for Algebra" along with an understanding of your school district's curriculum to monitor your child's progress in developing the preliminary skills for learning algebra.
 Many of the concepts taught in algebra can be presented to children at a younger age if done in a manner appropriate to their age. For example, you can introduce the concept of variables by asking your child what number added to 6 makes 10.

 Stand it up on its edge so that it is neither on the "heads" nor "tails" side.
 Face one full side towards you, so that you can either see the heads or tails of the coin.
 If you're spinning a quarter, flick George Washington's nose or the "In God We Trust Text". Don't flick it too hard or it will spin far away from you.


The trick to spinning a coin tightly by flicking is getting a good balance between speed and area. Try to flick the coin pretty quickly (using a good amount of force), but not so quickly that the coin flies too far away from you. On the other hand, when flicking with your index finger, try to only hit a small area of the actual coin; hit too much area and your coin will go flying.
Remember to keep your other hand on the coin even as you flick it. If you let go of the coin with your one hand, you won't get a tight spin.

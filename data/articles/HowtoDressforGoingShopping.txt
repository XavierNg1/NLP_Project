 It is not fun to take tennis shoes off and then put them right back on, so in the summer, go with flips flops, and in the winter go with slip on tennis shoes with no laces.;
, Tight clothes are hard to get on and off, so you won't have fun while you're out.
 Collared shirts tend to be a pain while trying to get back on. Wear a regular shirt that is easy to get in and out of.
 Suggestions for guys are loose pants or shorts. Basically, wear bottoms that you can change out of easily.
 Big loop earrings get stuck in hair and clothes and it may be a frustration in the dressing room if jewelry gets tangled.
, Wear colors that will match with anything you try on so that you can more easily envision yourself in the clothes you try on.

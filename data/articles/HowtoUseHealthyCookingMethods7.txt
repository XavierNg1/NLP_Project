 Marinade your meat or vegetables in vinegar, lemon juice, herbs, spices, or wine. A healthy baking method does not include adding oils or other fats to the marinade.
 Rotate the food halfway through its cooking duration. Also rotate the pan if your oven cooks unevenly.
 If so, remove them. You should be careful not to bake the food for too long, since the hot, dry heat of an oven can dry out food.


The healthy baking method does not include the baking of pastries, desserts and most breads. Many of these include added oils and fats and empty calories from processed flour and sugar.

You will want to include the amount of gold you have and the word 'Buying' in the topic title. (e.g. Buying with 150k, 150k | Buying)
In the first post, put whether they should PM you or post in the thread, as well as things you don't want to buy and things you do want to buy.
 When you get offers, take about 10k off of items under 100k, 20k off of those under 200k and so on.

Before you buy an item, make sure it sells quickly.

For example, buying an item that sells 5-6 units a day will sell very slow, however, if the item sells 50-60 units a day, it might sell before you can refresh the page.

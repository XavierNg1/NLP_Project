 If you’re in good shape and have run an obstacle course race before, 4 weeks of training should be sufficient. For beginners, 90 days of training will prepare you best. High level athletes should train 5 days per week, while beginners will benefit most from a 3 day a week schedule.


Generally, you should plan on working on endurance one day, strength another, and combining those two aspects on a third day.
If you have an active daily schedule, you may want to plan your workouts for the evening or early in the morning.

Take about 5 minutes of rest time between your sets of burpees and running.

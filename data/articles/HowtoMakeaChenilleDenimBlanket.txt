 You may do this by collecting old jeans, or you can buy denim yardage if you prefer. In most cases, old jeans are better as they are a cheap and easily available source of material. A cheap source of flannel could be to use an old flannel sheet, but you may also purchase it new at a fabric shop.


Wash and dry the fabrics.;
, Make the rectangles or squares a minimum of 8 to 10 inches (20-25 cm) wide (the width of the pant leg is usually sufficient). You can get a rip started by cutting a slit in the seam, cutting in the direction you want the material to tear.


The object of tearing the material into the desired size is to begin the fraying process. You could also cut the material to shape and let the washing machine do the fraying for you later.
 Sew diagonally from corner to corner and not around the perimeter. The purpose is to baste the materials together, so don't panic if your seams are not perfect.
 Do this by sewing the squares together with the flannel sides together and leaving a 1.5 inch (4 cm) seam allowance. For added seam strength, sew each seam twice.
 Be sure to leave the wide seam allowance. You may choose to miter the seam ends to make it easier for your sewing machine to handle the thick material.
 You can be quite random about this, so long as the edge you are about to sew is the same length of the strip you wish to sew it to. Always sew with flannel sides together and leave a wide seam allowance (it is recommend that you keep the seam allowance fairly consistent, but it can vary as much as .5 cm or a quarter of an inch with no problems).
 Do this when the blanket reaches your desired size.
 Make your clips approximately half an inch or (1.5 cm) apart. Clip all the seam allowances. You may also choose to clip the outer edge up to your zigzag seam.,, Be sure to clean out your dryer's lint trap, as it will be full by now.

 Securing your hair in braids before you go to bed will reduce friction and tangling. Your hair wonâ€™t be able to move about so freely, further reducing tangles., Satin is a smooth fabric and your hair will not stick to or get caught in it like with cotton. The reduced friction of smooth fabric can be a powerful tangle prevention measure.
 Get regular trims and cut off split ends. Take off a small amount from the ends to remove split ends on your hair and prevent further damage. Fewer split ends will result in fewer tangles.
 This will help keep it under control and prevent tangles. Ponytails and braids can also help in other situations where you know your hair might get tangled -- high winds, convertibles, motorcycles, etc.

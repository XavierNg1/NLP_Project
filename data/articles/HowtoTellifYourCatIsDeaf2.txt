 The BAER (Brainstem auditory evoked response) test monitors electrical activity in the brain that is caused by auditory stimulation (such as hearing pans banging together). This test helps a vet to see if your cat’s brain has actually registered a sound, and if one or both ears are involved.If your vet does not have BAER test equipment, ask about auditory centers that may be able to help you.
 Three small electrodes will be attached to your cat’s head. The machine will then produce a series of clicking sounds that are generated at a range of frequencies.


The electrodes will help to monitor your cat’s brain’s responses to the clicks.
 Good natured cats can usually go through with a short test while fully conscious. This short test only checks to see if your cat is fully deaf or not.A full hearing test that gives detailed answers as to the severity of the deafness, and whether or not both ears are affected, generally takes 20 to 30 minutes. Cats usually need to be sedated for this longer test.

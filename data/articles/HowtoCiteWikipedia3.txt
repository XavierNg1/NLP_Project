 In Chicago Style citations, web sources are usually cited very briefly. To begin, you would simply write the title of an article in quotations followed by a comma. For example, "Jimmy Carter,"., You should include the access date or the date the site was last modified. This is to indicate to readers how up-to-date the information is. As Wikipedia changes so frequently, it makes sense to add the date you accessed the information. In Chicago style, you list the month, then the date, a comma, and then the year. For example, if you accessed the information on March 11, 2015 you would write "March 11, 2015." Include a comma after the date.The example citation would now read: "Jimmy Carter," accessed March 11, 2015,

, You should always add the URL after the date. List the full URL and end with a period. This is all the information required for Chicago Style citations when citing Wikipedia.The example citation would now read: "Jimmy Carter," accessed March 11, 2015, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter.
 In Chicago Style, it's generally preferred that you do not cite web citations in your bibliography. Instead, include footnotes or cite the information in the text itself. For example, "According to the Wikipedia page, Jimmy Carter was born in 1924."

 Select your image you want to make art from trigonometry by -- here, for example, the objective is a bowl of cherries. Decide on the basic curve to employ. Here, for example, the curve selected was the sine wave curve on a sphere because it can come to inner endpoints like a cherry does, also because of shading considerations it's better than the spherical helix and finally because of the way spheres are joined, the stems are not spirallic as in the spherical helix. The basic plan is to make random arrangements of cherries in a bowl that may fluctuate at the user's discretion, so that the user may choose the arrangement they find most pleasing. The selection here represented had stems that were too long, and there has been a significant Revision from the chart data via inspection of where the 1's occur in column D, especially concerning "twinned cherries" -- look for MODIFIED or NEW if you are revising your work to date please. This workbook is very time-intensive and a lot of effort is being made to obtain the best results possible.

 D, indicate where new sphere or cherry starts and old ones end, so they indicate where the connecting lines (stems) are over in the charting columns. These connecting lines may be verified by hovering over them on the chart with the cursor until the datapoint data appears.

Command+Shift Select K6:L17288 and Q6:R17288 and Format Fill sky blue for the charting columns.
Select K17286 and enter w/o quotes "=K6" to make the complete connecting line. Format fill sea foam green with font red, bold black border outline, aligned center. Copy this and paste to L17286 and then also to Q17286:R17286.  Do Paste Special Format of the current cell to cells M5:N5, G6:G7, E6:E7, and C6:D6.
Separate each two adjacent columns of data from the next two by a bold border right outline. Separate all column Headings into their own bold outline boxes. Select cell range A17285:R17285, copy it and paste it to A17287 as backup formulas. There will be temporary errors -- those are acceptable. They may have to do with column definitions.
Select cell K17291 and enter "=MIN(K6:K17285)"; select cell K17292 and enter "=MAX(K6:K17285)". Copy K17291:K17292 to L17291 and Q17291:R17291 as an aid to charting.
 Under Chart Wizard, a new Chart sheet will be created but per the Ribbon, a graph will land atop the data of the Data01 worksheet. Copy (or Cut) this graph and paste it to the top left corner of the Chart worksheet. Hover over the lower right corner until the cursor becomes a double-headed arrow and then select the corner and pull the graph into an approximate square. These steps may take some minutes, depending upon your processor. Wait times of 4 minutes were common for such job as a recalculation of new random arrangement, copy picture, etc. Again, it is much faster to have a mini-chart of columns Q and R with red line, weight 1, on the DATA01 worksheet than to wait the 5 minutes for the actual chart to generate.
Click in the Plot Area to add series 2. Do menu item Chart Add Data and in response to the range query, activate the Data01 worksheet and Edit Go To cell range Q6:R17285, then click OK. This often comes out wrong and has to be corrected in the formula bar. The two series you want are =SERIES(,'DATA 01'!$K$6:$K$17286,'DATA 01'!$L$6:$L$17286,1) and =SERIES(,'DATA 01'!$Q$6:$Q$17286,'DATA 01'!$R$6:$R$17286,2), in that order (per the last number in the last chart parameter of the foregoing chart function statements). The standard preference is for no grid lines or axes or legend, all of which can be set to none via Chart Layout.
Under Chart Layout, per clicking in the Plot Area, one reaches at the far left Current Selection -- Plot Area -- and Format Selection. Under this, the Fill has been set to the Texture Oak, Line has been set to None and no other effects were added.
Next, the Current Selection is set to Series 1, the bowl, and Format Selection shows that Shadow has been set to Outer, 270 degrees, black, size 100%, blur 4 pt, distance 21 pt and transparency 2%. No glow or soft edges were used. Line = 180 pt weight, style solid dashed,  and the gradient picture is presented here (with the final right hand white coming in at 68% and the maroon at 66%):










Next, the Current Selection is set to Series 2, the cherries, and Format Selection shows that Shadow was set but never turned out, even though none of the cherry's colors are transparent, so for whatever reason. Here is the picture of the Line Gradient for the Cherries, plus some of the colors:





Starting at 4% White, we then go to Pink/Fuchsia, and so on:












































 Opening graphic - 15 cherries, paired


Save the Data chit section from A1:R15 as Formulas, then below that as Paste Special Values to the Saves Worksheet, and under these two sets of data, save a copied picture of the chart by using the shift key + copy and the shift key + paste.
Save the workbook.

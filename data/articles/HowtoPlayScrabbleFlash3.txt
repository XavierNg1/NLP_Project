 Since Scrabble Five-Letter Flash only lets you make five letter words, you must move all of the tiles to create your words. If you get stumped, try placing the tiles in random combinations to see if they make a word. When you make a word, the tiles will beep and display 5 new letters.
 You will get 75 seconds to play your words and the goal is to make as many 5-letter words as you can in the time allotted. If you find this version of Scrabble Flash too challenging, try playing regular Scrabble Flash for a while to build your skills.
 After you have lined up the tiles, wait for your score to appear. The game will display your total score (SCR) and the maximum score (MAX) you could have earned if you had made every word possible with the 5 letters you were given.

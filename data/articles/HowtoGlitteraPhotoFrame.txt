 It's also recommended to place down a smaller sheet of paper to make it easy to pick up and recycle the loose glitter; a printer paper page is ideal, as it can be turned into a funnel to return the glitter to the jar.;
, The supplies are listed below, under "Things You'll Need".
 Pop out the glass or perspex in the frame, if relevant. This will stop it from getting glitter on it. An alternative is to cover it with newspaper and painter's tape but it's much easier to remove it, if you can.
 Position it over the printer page, if using.
, Aim for an even covering, avoiding the creation of clumps on any part of the frame.
 By doing a side at a time, you can take it slowly and ensure a neat and even covering of glitter.


If you'd prefer to just add a design on one part of the frame, simply add liquid glue to that part of the frame and sprinkle the glitter there. For example, you could use a stencil, holding it over the portion of the frame where you'd like the design to go, infill with glue, then sprinkle the glitter on. Remove the stencil before it gets stuck to the frame too.
 Collect all loose glitter and restore it to the jar by funneling it back in.
 Although optional, a sealant will protect the glitter layer and reduces the amount of glitter that will flake off the frame over time. Use a suitable sealant, such as Mod Podge or varnish. Allow it to fully dry before using the frame.
 Slide the glass back into the frame, add your photo and tighten the fittings at the back. The glitter frame is now ready to shine on your shelf.

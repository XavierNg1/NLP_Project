 Converting from kilograms to pounds is simple. Best of all, once you know how to do it, it's something that you can use in a wide variety of situations. Start with the number of kilograms you want to convert.


For example, let's say that you want to convert 5.9 kilograms to pounds. In the next few steps, we'll do just this.;
, Next, just multiply your kilogram measurement by 2.2. The answer you get is the number of pounds that is equal to your kilogram measurement.


In the example from above, you can convert by multiplying 5.9 by 2.2. 5.9 × 2.2 = 12.98 pounds.
Don't forget the "pounds" label. If you're doing this calculation for schoolwork, you can lose points if you leave the label off. If you're doing the calculation for something else, the person who reads your work may misunderstand your answer.
 Technically, multiplying kilograms by 2.2 to get pounds is sort of a "shortcut" for easier conversions. If you want to get the most accurate result possible, you'll probably want to use a more accurate value for the conversion. 2.2046 should be accurate enough for most purposes.


In the example above, if we use the more-accurate value, we get 5.9 × 2.2046 = 13.00714 pounds. This is a minor difference, but if we're aiming for very precise measurements, this may be the better choice.
If you want to be even more accurate, consider using a conversion factor with more decimal places. At an extreme level of accuracy, one kilogram is equal to 2.2046226218 pounds., Getting from a pounds measurement back to kilograms is as simple as dividing the number of pounds by your conversion factor. In other words, if you used the basic "2.2" conversion above, divide by 2.2. If you used 2.2046, divide by 2.2046, and so on.


In the example from above, you can get from 12.98 pounds back to the original kilogram measurement like this: 12.98/2.2 = 5.9 kilograms. Don't forget the label!
Don't mix and match your conversion factors — only divide by the number you originally multiplied by. For instance, since you got 13.00714 pounds when you used the more accurate 2.2046 conversion, you wouldn't divide by 2.2. This would give you 13.00714/2.2 = 5.912 kilograms, which is slightly different from your starting 5.9 kilograms.

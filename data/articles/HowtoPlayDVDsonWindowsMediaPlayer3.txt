 While you can install a codec pack or decoder to enable DVD playback in Windows Media Player, these either cost money or come saddled with adware. You'll have a much easier time playing DVDs in XP or Vista if you download and use a third-party media player. These will also allow you to play virtually any video file format, including the popular MKV.The two most popular players are VLC and MPC-HC. Both are free and open-source, and do not come bundled with spyware. You can download VLC from videolan.org/vlc and MPC-HC from mpc-hc.org.
 Run the installer after downloading and follow the prompts to install it. Neither program will install spyware if you downloaded it directly from the official website. Most users can keep all of the settings at their default.
 Place the DVD into your computer's DVD drive. Make sure that it is a drive that is capable of reading DVDs.
 You'll be able to find your newly installed media player in the Start menu or on your desktop. Launch it if it does not start automatically when the DVD is inserted.
 You can click the Play button in your media player to begin playing the inserted DVD. You may be prompted to select the drive before the DVD begins playing.
 Sometimes DVDs just won't play, and there are a few things that may be causing this:


Your DVD player can likely only play DVDs from the same region. If you're trying to play an import DVD, you may have to do some digging about flashing your DVD player's firmware.
If your DVD player is failing, it won't be able to play DVDs. You may need to install a new DVD player if this is the case. See How to Install a DVD Drive for details.

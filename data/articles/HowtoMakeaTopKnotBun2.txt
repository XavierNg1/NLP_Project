 Work with second or third day hair or spray your hair with dry shampoo to give it some texture. Then comb your hair into a high ponytail near the top of your head, securing it with a hair tie.








This style is especially good for those with curly or wavy hair, since curly hair gives you a more voluminous look.
 Take about a quarter of your hair from the ponytail and hold it straight up above your head. Use a comb to backcomb through the hair, starting at the midpoint of the hair and combing down to the base of the ponytail. Repeat until you have lightly backcombed each section of hair.








Backcombing your hair makes it more voluminous and textured so that your top knot is fuller.
 After backcombing your hair, take the comb and lightly brush the very top layer of hair in the ponytail, brushing from the base of the ponytail down to the tips of the hair.








Comb very gently with a brush rather than a comb, which will be easier to work with on backcombed hair.
Smoothing this very top layer of the ponytail will keep the top knot looking smooth, even if the hair in the center of the top knot is full and textured.
 Take the hair of your ponytail and wrap it clockwise around the base of the ponytail. When you reach the tips of your hair, tuck the hair underneath the hair tie.
 After you twist your hair into the top knot, pin your hair in place with several bobby pins. Use your fingers to pull the bun out if you wish to give it more volume and then spray lightly with hairspray to give it better hold.

 Children born with a chromosomal or genetic anomaly are at a greater risk for developmental delays. These anomalies are common in children with Down syndrome, as the child has an extra genetic material that alters the course of their development, resulting in a developmental delay., Factors such as exposure to toxic agents like lead and drugs before or after birth, as well as poor maternal nutrition, transmitted infections like measles or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from mother to child during pregnancy, premature birth and a lack of maternal care can all put a child at a higher risk for developmental delays.


As the number of risk factors increase for a child, this will make them more susceptible to developmental delays. The risk factors have a cumulative effect on the child.
 As these developmental issues can lead to serious health issues for your child, it’s a good idea to test them from an early age to prevent any smaller delays from becoming bigger, life changing issues.


Screening is a broad and fast measurement of a child’s skills, and is a good preliminary step to determine if your child requires a more in depth evaluation. Developmental screening can be performed through a questionnaire given to the child’s parents or guardians, or as a test given to the child by a trained health professional.
A developmental evaluation is a more extensive and thorough assessment of your child’s skills and is only performed by an experienced health professional, such as a psychologist. This test will outline your child’s strengths and weaknesses in all five developmental areas. The outcome of this evaluation will indicate if your child needs immediate medical assistance or treatment.

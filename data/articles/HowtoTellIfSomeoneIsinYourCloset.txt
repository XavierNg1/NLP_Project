 Make sure that it is truly funny. If you hear giggling then that is a sure tell sign someone is in there.;
, Clothes generally create no noise but air conditioners can mask the sound. In a nice, quiet, room, you can hear the person in your closet breathing.
 Keep in mind that someone inside your closet generally will have a hard time closing the door.
 If not, try looking under the closet to see feet. This step should be taken with caution, as the person inside may notice and pop out at you. But remember, as the person outside, you have the best control over the doors!

, This high-tech technique is nearly sure to find anyone hiding inside.
 Make sure that it makes a noise locking it. Then fake closing you door ( open the door, count to 2, then close it ). If someone is inside there, they would be freaking out because they can't get out.
 While this approach seems rather basic, it may catch your hider off-guard!

,, Then, using a hand (or pole), poke your clothes or any hiding spaces gently to check for people. If you find none, congratulations, your closet is clear.

 If you cannot use the online process, or you need the greatest anonymity possible, or you find it is simply unwieldy and difficult given the type or bulk of documentation that you have, Wikileaks enables you to post the documents and related information.
 The information can be provided in any format that you're able to access and use effectively.


You can send CDs, DVDs, USB flash drives (memory sticks), microfiche, handwritten evidence, photos, etc.
Make two copies of anything transferred on a floppy disk, as floppies can be unreliable.Wikileaks will scan paper documents if they are of significant political or media interest â€“ you can contact Wikileaks at http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Contact_us first if you're unsure of the significance of your documents.
 If writing "Wikileaks" on the address label is going to cause suspicion and problems, then don't. Instead, use any name or acronym (e.g., "WL") you'd like, provided that you use the correct postal address. Contact Wikileaks direct at http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Contact_us for relevant unlisted postal addresses.



You can post to any country in the Wikileaks network. Post to whichever country you feel is most suitable. Go by the nature of the material and your postal service's reliability/ability.
Where your country has an unreliable postal system, make multiple copies and use DHL, FedEX, or another postal courier service.
Another method is to send the materials to multiple addresses, to make sure the materials reach at least one of them.
Provision of a return address is up to you. If you do use one, make it clear so that the envelope can be returned to you.
 Wikileaks will destroy the mailed package.

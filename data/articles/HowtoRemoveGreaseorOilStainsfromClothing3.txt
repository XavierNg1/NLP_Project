 Spray the spot remover liberally onto the area and scrub with a toothbrush.
 Allow the spot remover to set while you start this step.
 A couple things to remember as you perform this step:


Place your garment in a tub, washbasin, or other safe area. It's not recommended to place the garment on the floor and splatter extremely hot water all over it (and potentially your feet)
Try to lift up the pot of water as high as possible. This method works for two reasons:
The water is really hot, helping to break the grease and/or oil bonds.
The water forcefully hits the grease/oil stain. The higher up the water is when you pour it over the stain, the more force it will generate as it hits the clothing.


Be careful! You're using scalding hot water. Be sure to aim the water onto the garment. Try to avoid any splatter than might come back and hit you.
 Turn the garment inside out and attack the stain with another round of spot remover/boiling water if method doesn't work first time.
 Follow washing instructions on clothing label exactly.









When ready to dry, allow the clothing to air-dry. Drying in the extremely hot mechanical dryer may cause any lingering oil or grease to set into the clothing.

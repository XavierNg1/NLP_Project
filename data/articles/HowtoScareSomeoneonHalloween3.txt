 Tell them to get a costume that makes him or her look like a murderer. However, get a regular costume for yourself.
 Find out your planned path for trick-or-treating. Familiarize yourself with it, and look for a place that is dark and hidden (ex: a corner).


It's best that you pick a location during the evening, when you'll be able to see where the shadows fall.
 In the middle of trick-or-treating, get close to the spot (in this case it's the corner of the the street).
 You could also have the adult make the sound, but this isn't recommended if they can't make a convincing, eerie noise.
 However, tell the group to stay behind. Be very firm in your decision, and make sure no one follows you.
 Walk down the street until you think the group can't see you.
 Have the adult spray fake blood over you while making a convincing, chainsaw sound. Scream when he/she makes it.


You could record the sound of a chainsaw onto a camera and play it loudly. That way, the sound will be more convincing.
 They'll see you covered in fake blood.
 The group will hopefully run away. If not, that's perfectly fine - let them know it was just a prank.
 At some point later on, join the group (or not).

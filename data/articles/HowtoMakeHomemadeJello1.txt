 Get out a small saucepan and pour in 1 Â½ cups (355 ml) of juice, 1/2 cup (120 ml) of water and 1 tablespoon agar agar flakes OR 1 teaspoon agar agar powder. Stir the mixture to combine the ingredients.You can use any juice except for pineapple juice. Pineapple contains enzymes that will prevent the jello from setting up.;
, Turn the heat on to high and bring the jello mixture to a boil. Boil the mixture for 5 minutes and stir it occasionally. This will help dissolve the agar agar. Turn off the heat.If you want sweeter jello, you can stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons of honey.
 Peel and slice 1 to 2 cups (175 to 350 g) of fresh fruit. Lay it in the bottom of an 8x8-inch (20x20-cm) baking dish. Avoid using raw fruits that have enzymes which prevent the jello from setting up (or you can just cook them first). These fruits include:Pineapple
Kiwi
Mango
Fig
Guava
Ginger root
Pawpaw

, Slowly pour the jello over the fruit. Put the baking dish in the refrigerator and chill the jello for 4 hours or until the jello is firm. You can slice the jello into squares and serve them immediately. Or you can use cookie cutters to make unique jello shapes.For example, you can cut stars, hearts, circles, or festive shapes.

 Blush keeps your face looking rosy. When used correctly, it gives the appearance of looking sun kissed and happy, and helps you avoid looking too pale, which could give the impression you are ill or nervous. Start at the apples of your cheeks and move up toward your temples using a blush brush. Blend using your fingers so you do not see an obvious line where you applied. If you are fair skinned, stick with soft pinks, peaches or light corals and apply lightly in order to keep a natural look. Applying too darkly or using a darker color will look too dramatic.
For a medium skin tone, use pinks and peaches and avoid applying too darkly. Refrain from using colors with a blue undertone, as those could create a bruised look rather than the naturally sun-kissed you are going for.
If your skin tone is dark, use deep reds, oranges, or browns to highlight your cheeks.
 For a natural yet lasting look, use lip balm, lipliner, and lipstick. Make sure your lip balm has an SPF of 15 or more to protect your lips. Your lip liner and lipstick should be a softer shade that resembles your natural lip color. We are enhancing your natural beauty, not changing it! Start with lip balm to keep your lips moisturized. This will serve as a base for everything else you're going to do.
Line your lips with lipliner. Choose a shade that is a close match to the lipstick you are going to use. In addition to lining your lips, lightly color in your lips. This helps the lipstick last all day.
Apply lipstick by puckering your lips and starting from the middle of your lips (where lipstick fades the quickest).

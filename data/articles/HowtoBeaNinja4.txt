 This does not necessarily mean becoming lean and muscular; it means building endurance, agility, strength and flexibility. Go for long distance runs, swimming, push-ups, chin-ups, crunches, squats, and make sure to stretch. Your body is a tool - as long as it can perform the functions of a ninja, it is a valuable tool.
 Ninja were often very knowledgeable. With knowledge comes power and this can help you become more resourceful and also help you blend in more easily.
 Perhaps not traditional meditation, but meditation based on complete awareness of your actions. Train your mind to be completely aware of your actions when the need arises, for prolonged periods of time.

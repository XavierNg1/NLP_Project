 Like fabric patches, key-chains are a great way to express yourself. Popular themes include souvenir key-chains from your travels, favorite cartoon characters, and plush toys.


You can buy mini sharpie marker key-chains. Hang these on your schoolbag so you and your friends can sign you name or draw designs at any time.
 Collect buttons from concerts, charity events, or as souvenirs. Buttons are available in an infinite array of designs, images, or sayings. Shop around and find buttons that fit your style and taste.


Look online for buttons from foreign countries or foreign sport teams.
Keep a collection at home and change them up frequently to keep things interesting. Avoid anything with profanity or nudity, especially when at school.
Always unpin any buttons prior to washing.
 Consider redecorating an old schoolbag instead of spending money on a new one, or purchase several plain schoolbags and decorate them using different color schemes, designs, and/or techniques. You can also coordinate your schoolbag's colors and designs to match a favorite outfit. Additionally, you can apply these methods to decorating other types of bags, such as totes, purses, or drawstring bags.

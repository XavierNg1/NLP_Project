 You can use live bait like panfish worms, night crawlers, and wax worms to attract bluegills to your hook. Other smaller insects like crickets, minnows, and baby crayfish can also attract the fish.Look up what the bluegill naturally eats in the habitat that you're fishing in to increase your chances of catching one.
 Artificial lures like wet flies that look like insect larvae are attractive to bluegills. When fishing with wet flies or other jigs, slightly twitch the line to emulate movement and to attract the bluegills to your line.When using jigs, stick to small jigs, like 1/100 oz (.28 g) or 1/64 oz (.44 g) lead-heads.
 Things like sweet corn, bread, and hot dogs are things that bluegills like to eat. If you don't have any other bait, you can roll up a piece of bread into a ball or place a piece of corn on the end of your hook as bait.

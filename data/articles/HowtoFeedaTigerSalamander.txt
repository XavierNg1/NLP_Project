 Tiger salamanders eat insects only, occasionally pinky mice (recommended for larger salamanders only, and also as a treat. Pinky mice can make your tiger obese and it can get sick). Crickets or mealworms are good staple foods. Tiger salamanders can also eat earth worms, dubia roaches, and wax worms.

Gut-loading crickets a day or two before feeding the salamander(s) will pass down the nutrients.
Dusting the insect with reptile/amphibian calcium will help.;
, You can use your hands or tweezers/tongs. The salamander will either quickly use its tongue to get the food into its mouth or it will lunge forward and bite it.Â 

If the salamander bites down on your finger/tweezers/tongs do not try to throw/fling it off, or try to pull! You can injure your salamander!!

, If you're letting your salamander hunt its food on its own, don't try to help it. Just make sure your tiger does not eat a rock, moss, or dirt along with its food. Those can mess with its digestive system and could harm it., When your salamander has eaten the food, remove any left over food. If the salamander finds it later and eats it, it could be harmful to the salamander if bacteria has started to grow on the old food.

 Perhaps you want to change your demeanor because your behavior bothers other people. You may seek to reform your habits for the sake of peace or happiness, or to bring your life into greater balance. Perhaps you feel that you are living beyond your means, or that you can't control your feelings, or that you spend too much of your life with your head in the clouds.;
, There is no one way to be "down to earth," and there is no single big change that you can make to immediately become "down to earth." It is a lifestyle, a demeanor, and a label. It is a collection of habits. Thus: if you want to be more down to earth, you'll need to start by changing your habits. Try to identify specific behaviors that do not feel "down to earth," and begin by gradually changing these behaviors.


There are many ways to be "down to earth." Ultimately, this is a quality that you want to see in yourself, and a quality that you may not find in your current way of being. Start from where you are.
 It can be hard to stay self-aware, especially when you are evaluating the way that you act on a day-to-day basis. Look for someone that you trust to hold you accountable â€“ a friend, a family member, a teacher, a counselor. Speak frankly with this person about your desire to be more down to earth. Together, identify specific habits and behaviors that you can change to reach your goal. Ask the person to keep an eye on the way that you're acting, and check in with them periodically to review your progress.

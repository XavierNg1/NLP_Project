 Do you like the new guy because he's cute, funny, and smart? Or do you like him because he reminds you of your ex? It can be easier to look for a new relationship that's just like the old one. It may make you happy for a few dates, but it's less likely to last. If the new guy seems interesting because he reminds you of your ex, you may be rebounding.
Listen to what your new guy has to say. If your mind is wandering to other people or your ex, this may not be a good fit. But if you are interested in what he has to say, then focus on that.
 If you've been on a few dates with a guy, and feel like there's a connection, don't assume he's only a rebound from your last relationship. On the other hand, don't assume that every new guy is even more wonderful than the last. If a new guy is genuine, honest, and caring, don't simply put him in the "rebound" category because it's a few weeks or months after your last relationship. This will likely hurt the relationship, and hurt him if you make him feel less-than.
Allow yourself to be loved and appreciated. Don't keep your guard up so much that you feel like no guy will be there for you. Treat him the same way you'd like to be treated.
 Be clear with them that you had a break-up, but that you are hopeful for a future relationship. No one can tell you when you're ready to start dating and opening yourself to love except you.


Share about yourself, but avoid oversharing all the details of your past relationship. Don't try to rehash the break-up with a new guy in your life.
If you're feeling vulnerable, consider setting boundaries with any new person you date. Stay true to what you think it is right for you to be safe and happy. Don't let others decide for you.

 You'll need to be playing a song in order to like it. You can enter a song, artist, or genre into the "Create Station" field in the upper-left corner to begin playing music.
 When you're using the website version of Pandora, you can only Like or Dislike songs. There is no "Bookmark" feature like there is on mobile devices. When you like a song, it will appear in the Likes list on your mobile device instead of the Bookmarks list.


Even though they have different names and are found in different places, Likes and Bookmarks generally act the same way.
 You'll find this underneath the album art or band picture.


Even though this has a picture of a Thumbs Up, and it adds the item to your Likes list, this is not the same as giving the song a Thumbs Up while it is playing. It will not affect how your stations are created like giving a Thumbs Up does.
 This will open your profile page.
 This will display the songs, artists, and albums that you have given a thumbs up for.
 You'll be able to see lyrics, features, similar tracks, comments, and links to buy.
 This will remove the song, artist, or album from your Likes list.
 These are the bookmarks you created on the mobile app or on the old version of the website; it is not possible to add bookmarks from the current version of the Pandora website., Click the â–¼ button next to the "Play a Sample" button and select "Delete" to remove the bookmark from your list.

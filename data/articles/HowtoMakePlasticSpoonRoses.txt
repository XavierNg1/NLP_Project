, This can be any kind of candle, scented or not. You may want to make this rose outdoors because burnt plastic has a very strong and unpleasant smell.
 Hold one spoon concave down about and inch or two over the flame. When it starts to melt and wrinkle, remove it from the flame and carefully pinch it into a bud by pulling the outside edges toward each other, then snip the handle. Be mindful of the hot plastic!

, Hold spoons over the candle one at a time, concave side up. Allow the spoon to become pliable, then form the petal by pulling the tip downwards to stretch it. Leave about a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of handle on the spoons. The farther away from the bud, the longer and flatter the petals should be.
 You can start on the outside by melting the handles of your longer petals together, or build off off the bud by working your way outwards. Every once in a while, put the rose over the flame to soften the bottom to adhere the petals and then lightly press the bottom of the rose against your hard surface to flatten it.
 Each rose may look a little different, some taller or shorter, wider or smaller. If you started from the bud outwards, you can stop adding petals once your rose is the size you want it.
 You can make a pin, a pendant, a wreath, or you can glue multiple roses to a globe for a unique decoration!

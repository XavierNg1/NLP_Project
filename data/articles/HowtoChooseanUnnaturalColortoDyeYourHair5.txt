 You know what colors you like and dislike. Treat yourself by dying your hair your favorite color. If you like blue, dye your hair a unique shade of blue that stands out to you. The same can be said if you like the color red and its varieties. Hair dye isn’t permanent and if you feel strongly towards a color, go for it.
 This works well if you like a monochromatic look. For example, if you love to wear green, choose a shade of green that is slightly different from your clothing. This way your hair won’t fully match the outfits you like to wear, but your hair will match your style.Sort through your wardrobe for inspiration. Look at your favorite outfits and decide if you love them based off their colors.
 Blue eyed people could go with yellow, orange, or blue. Green eyed people could go with blue, purple, or green. Brown/hazel eyed people could go with red, pink, or green. Unnatural hair looks good with any eye color.


Take suggestions for what colors complement your eyes from your peers.
Some people’s eye color changes based off what they are wearing. Other people’s eyes don’t change color as often.
 If you are loud and bold, you could go with a bright color such as red, orange, aqua, yellow, or neon green. If you are creative and artistic you could choose a variety of green, orange, blue, or purple. If you are smart and studious, muted colors such as baby pink, dark blue, or dark purple might work for you.
 Remember, not all hair colors work on all types of hair and skin tone. A blue tone can come out as yellow or green when applied to the wrong hair color, for example. Remember factors like the color wheel, your natural hair color, and your skin tone when finding a shade based on your personality. You may have to go with your second or third choice.

 Tap on the Spotify’s app either on your home screen or app drawer to open it.
 If you did not log out from your previous Spotify session, most likely you will still be logged in. If not, enter your account information (email address on the upper box and your password on the lower box) on the login screen then click the “Log in” button to continue.
 Once logged in, swipe the screen from left to right. On the page that appears, tap on the link labeled “Offline devices.” All your offline devices will now be displayed.
 Click on the device you want to remove and then click the “REMOVE” button.


Repeat this step for all the devices that you want to remove.

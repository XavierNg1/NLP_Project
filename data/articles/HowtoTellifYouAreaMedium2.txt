 If you are a medium, you might see auras or symbols surrounding people.These images might just be fuzzy fields of color or physical symbols or scenes, like a lake or river. They are probably normal to your internal world, so pay close attention to how you perceive others.
This is a large part of clairvoyance.These images might just be within your mind’s idea, rather than outside of you physically.
Also, notice if you tend to see things out of the corner of your eye that others don’t perceive.
 Do you know if someone walks into a room without seeing that person? Sensing others’ energy or moods can be an indication that you’re a medium.


You have deep intuition about people’s moods.
If you hold an object owned by a person, you can sense deep emotions and experiences connected with that person through the object.
 Your personal experiences surrounding death might reveal that you have a psychic gift.


After someone you love dies, if you are a medium, you might experience odd occurrences. These could be as simple as unexplained slammed doors or strange sensations and feelings other than grief.
 Clairaudience, the ability to hear the voices of spirits, is a large part of being a medium.

You might not know that you can hear voices, as these are usually not audible outside yourself. They are internal voices.
You might have a series of nagging thoughts or ideas that come to you from seemingly nowhere.

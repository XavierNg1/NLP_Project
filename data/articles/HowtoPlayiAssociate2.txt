 Search for "iAssociate 2" or its developer, "TicBits". Currently, the app is free of charge.;
, It is a mini-level that will guide you through the basics (which are also outlined in this article).


The main objective of the game is to think of words that are associated with other words that link to each other.
 You will see a word in a red oval. A bunch of other white ovals filled with dashes and a number is linked to that one word via a grey dotted line. Each dash represents a letter and the number shows the total number of letters in the word. For example, ---- (4) suggests the word has four letters.
 In the example to the right, three words can be associated with "Surf" and one word with "Up". Also, "Surf's Up" can be broken into "Surf" and "Up", creating two associations.
 If it's right, you'll get points (see Tips), the oval will become red, and the grey dotted line(s) will transform into a black solid line. Other associations may appear, allowing the level to expand.
 These are indicated as a white question mark (?) in a green speech bubble. To see the clue, tap the word and it will appear at the top of the screen.

In-game hints: When you start a level, you will be given a number of hints (depending on the size of the level, they can be from 10-25). Hints reveal the word one letter at a time - one hint reveals one letter. Use sparingly and save until you're nearing the end of the level.

Facebook: You can ask friends on Facebook for help on words. A news story will appear on your Facebook wall requesting help.
 At certain intervals, you will get a message displaying your progress and be awarded a medal - bronze for completing 50 percent of the level, silver for 75 percent, and gold for 100 percent.

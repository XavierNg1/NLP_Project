 You can play this outside, in a pool, in the ocean, in your backyard, or even inside if you have a big space. Make sure if you're inside there are no breakable items that could easily get knocked over.;
, The thrower will throw the ball, determining how much it will be worth and whether it will be dead, alive, or both.
 The object of the game is to get 500 points first. The thrower will throw the ball, saying the amount of points it will be worth for the person who gets it. The throw can say dead, which means it has to fall on the ground before anyone can pick it up. If someone catches it while it's in the air it will count for nothing and has to be returned to the thrower. If they say alive, you must catch it before it hits the ground, and it will count for nothing if it hits the ground. If they say dead or alive, then it's basically whoever gets the ball first, no matter if they catch it in the air or if it falls on the ground and they pick it up. Whoever reaches 500 points first is the new thrower!

, First you say dead, alive, or dead or alive (see above) then when you throw it up, saying how much it will be worth. You can say any number between 0-500. Another way to play is to also add negatives, meaning whoever catches a negative numbered ball (i.e., -200) it will take away that much points from their score.

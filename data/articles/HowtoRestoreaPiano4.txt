 This may require several applications, especially if your piano has ornate parts or scroll work. (You can skip this step if your piano has no varnish or paint left on it.)

, Use paint thinner, fine steel wool and an old lint-free cloth. As almost all pianos use a very thin veneer, avoid taking off any more material than is necessary to remove the original finish.
 If you plan to use a lacquer finish coat, you must use a filler that has the same chemical makeup as the finish lacquer. (This will prevent a reaction to the stain you use that could cause uneven color after you stain the wood.)

, Most finishes can be applied over most types of wood stain, but polyurethane varnish cannot be applied over some stains.
 Use a lint-free rag. You can also use a foam brush (use only new brushes). Stain a small area at a time and wipe away any excess to avoid streaking.
 You can apply as many coats of stain as you would like; each new coat will deepen the color.

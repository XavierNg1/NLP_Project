 Use an electric drill to create a ⅛ inch hole in the center of the head. Increase the size of the drill bit by 1








Note the recommended depth for you specific screw extractor. Don’t make the hole deeper than recommended.
 Insert the extractor into the hole you created. Lightly tap it into the screw with a hammer—make sure the extractor’s threads grip the sides of the screw before proceeding. Locate a T handle—it likely came in your extractor kit—and attach it to the top of the extractor., Keep the extractor straight while turning it counter-clockwise. Avoid applying any lateral pressure to the extractor as this can cause it to bend. Continue turning the screw until it loosens. Pull up on the extractor to bring the screw to the surface. Pull the screw from the surface with a pair of pliers.

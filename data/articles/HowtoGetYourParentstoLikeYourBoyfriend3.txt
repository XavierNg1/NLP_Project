 You may feel torn between your parents and your boyfriend. But it’s not about who’s right or who’s wrong. It about reconstructing each side’s ideas about each other. Focus on being understanding.Tell you parents that ultimatums will likely be less helpful than having your parents get know your boyfriend.
Find ways to see compromise as a benefit for them and your boyfriend.
Remind your parents that you love them, and you’re not trying to hurt them with your choice of boyfriend.
 It may be hard to understand your parents’ ways or beliefs. They may seem to show little respect for your own choices. Try to take the high road and focus on being kind even if it’s tough. Show them that you can be respectful, even if you continue to see your boyfriend. Avoid alienating yourself from your family just because they say they don’t like your boyfriend.
Understand that their thoughts about your boyfriend may change with time. If you continue to be kind, polite, and mature, they are likely to be less overbearing about your boyfriend.
Treat them as you would like to be treated.
 Even if your family may be initially hesitant to include your boyfriend, find ways to have your boyfriend become more integrated into your family’s life. If your parents say they don’t want to see him, don’t assume that they will always act that way. Your parents may feel initial shock or worry when meeting a new boyfriend of yours. It may simply take time for them to feel more comfortable.
Make your boyfriend feel welcome at your home or in your life. Provide your boyfriend with reassurance that your parents may change their minds with time.

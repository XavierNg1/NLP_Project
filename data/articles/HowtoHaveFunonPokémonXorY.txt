 This is an obvious one, of course! Don't think the game is finished after you've beaten Team Flare! Head to the eighth city Gym, then head to the Pokémon League to challenge the Elite Four and Diantha. Make sure you have lots of Max Potions, Max Ethers and Revives with you!;
, There, Professor Sycamore can give you to the pass to Kiloude City. In that city, some of the main attractions include the Friend Safari, a special place where you can catch Pokémon of the same species that belong to your friend, and Battle Maison, where you can earn rewards for battling and buy items.
 Go to the cave at Pokémon Village, which should have been blocked before, and Mewtwo will be there, ready to be caught. Watch out! Mewtwo is level 70, so you'll need some fairly strong (but not too strong) Pokémon with you.
 If you chose Fennekin, you'll be able to catch the electric legendary, if you chose Chespin, you'll be able to get the water legendary and if you chose Froakie, you'll be able to get the fire legendary. Walk to somewhere you can encounter wild Pokémon and the legendary bird will appear, but flee before you can make a move. Use the Pokedex to track down where the bird has fled, and as quickly as you can, without using Fly, head to that place and encounter them again. Once you've done this several times, the bird will surrender to the Sea Spirit's Den. Head there and you can battle and catch it. Watch out! The legendary birds are level 70, so you'll need some fairly strong (but not too strong) Pokémon with you.
 You can find Zygarde in Terminus Cave. Watch out! Zygarde is level 70, so you'll need some fairly strong (but not too strong) Pokémon with you.
 It'll take a lot of hard work, but it's very rewarding when you finally get your paws on the glimmering, rare creature. Add some style to your team!

, It's next to impossible, so that is why you'll still be playing a lot.

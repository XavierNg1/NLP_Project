 Use a bucket, tub, or trough deep enough to submerge the entire garment underwater. Suitable soaking spaces may include a clean laundry sink, a clean bucket, or even a baby's bath. Add enough water that you can submerge all of the clothing, but not so much that the addition of the clothing will displace the water and make it spill over. To avoid this problem: try first filling the bucket with the clothes that you want to soak, and then pouring the water over the clothing.You will need to locate a suitable container that can be filled with water and still take the added clothing size. Remember that the weight of the clothing will increase the water level!

, Use the regular amount that you would use to wash your clothes. Swish and stir the cleaning agent to ensure that it dissolves into the water.
 Add the clothing and push deep under the water so that all of the garments are completely covered with water. Push down any pieces of fabric that pop up above the waterline.


If you are trying to remove a small, localized stain, then consider only soaking the stained corner of the fabric. This way, you won't need as much room.If the water spills over, then you've added too many garments. Try soaking in stages, or soaking simultaneously in multiple buckets., The length depends on the fabric: e.g. denim can be soaked for hours, and wool or cotton should not be exposed to stain remover for longer than 20-30 minutes.Do a light soak (20-30 minutes) if you're just having a routine wash. Soak for longer if you're trying to intensively remove a heavy stain., Rinse the fabric out before washing to remove the detergent. If the soak did not remove the stain, then you may consider soaking again â€“ but be careful not to be too hard on the fabric. A more intensive, localized soak or scrub might be the way to tackle a tough stain.

 While it is not recommended to turn to water shedding or "diet" pills, you can safely try taking one over-the-counter anti-gas pill to reduce excess air, gas, or other forms of intestinal bloat for a quick slimming effect.
 If you don't have gastrointestinal issues, try taking a magnesium supplement to help clear out your gut., This will help to elongate and relax your stomach muscles.Try bending both of your knees into your stomach while lying on the floor. In some cases, this posture can temporarily improve your bowel function.
Focus on your posture, too. Try to sit and stand up straight and don't hunch over or collapse your stomach. This can cause your stomach to seize and cramp up.
 Changing what and when you eat can help you banish the bloat.Avoid beans, the notoriously gassy musical fruit.
Eat smaller meals, slowly, and more frequently throughout the day to avoid bloating up when you eat.
Go for protein smoothies, yogurt, and low sodium soups instead of solid food. Liquids are easier to digest and don't pouch out your stomach as much as solid meals. Throw some fiber-rich fruit into your smoothies and yogurt to help move things along in (and out of) your intestines.Avoid carbonated beverages and chewing gum. The bubbles in these drinks can bloat you up, and you ingest a lot of extra air when you chew gum.

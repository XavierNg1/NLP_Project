 Use the round tip at the end of a wooden spoon to create evenly portioned holes throughout the entire cake., Pour the topping over the cake, filling in the holes as best as you can., Sprinkle the top with the chopped candy., Use plastic wrap to cover the cake and place it in the refrigerator to chill for a few hours. This allows the filling to absorb into the cake. Allow the cake to chill until it's ready to be served.

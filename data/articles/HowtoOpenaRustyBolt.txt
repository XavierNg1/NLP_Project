 Any sort of soft drink/soda/beer should work fine.;
,,, The fizzy drink should have dissolved the rust build-up causing the bolt to stick. This doesn't de-rust the entire bolt but it does loosen the bolt so that you can unscrew it.
 If your bolt is very rusted and old, it's time for a trip to the hardware store to buy a new one.

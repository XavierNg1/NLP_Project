 Try personal service and service by substitution first. Service by publication can only be performed if you have a written court order giving you permission to use this method.This method of service is very rare. In all likelihood, you will only be permitted to use it if you have already tried to serve the papers in every other reasonable way possible without any success.
 This is the name of the official court order permitting you to use this method of service. You must file an Application for Order for Publication of Summons and a statement of Declaration of Due Diligence to the court to obtain such an order.The declaration is simply a statement regarding the efforts already made to serve the respondent.
Tell the judge everything you know about where the other party might be. If you can show the court that the other party cannot be found, even if you know where the respondent should be, the judge may consider your request.
If the judge accepts your request, he or she will order the notice to be published in a newspaper the judge selects for the order.
 After the notice has been published in the newspaper for the amount of time specified by the judge, the papers are considered to be served. The newspaper will then need to provide a sworn statement stating that the publication has been made as directed.
 You will still need to fill out and file this form with the court as usual. The court will attach the newspaper's sworn statement to the complete form, as well.

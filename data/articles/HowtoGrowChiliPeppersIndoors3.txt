 Keep approximately 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of empty space between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot.
 The seeds should be spaced 2 inches (5 centimeters) apart from one another.
 You should only have about 0.2 inches (0.5 centimeters) of compost covering the seeds, just enough provide minimal protection.
 Spray the seeds with water as often as necessary in order to keep the soil moist. Water is essential to chili peppers, especially in the early stages of planting.
 Depending on the variety of chili pepper you chose, the first sprout may appear above the soil anywhere between one and six weeks.

 Taking low-dose aspirin has been shown to improve some women’s rate of pregnancy, though it’s in question whether this is due to increasing the thickness of the uterine lining.Only take aspirin with your doctor’s approval, after discussing your health history., Pentoxifylline (Trental) is a medication that increases your blood flow. It’s been combined with vitamin E to thicken the uterine lining of women trying to get pregnant.It can make you dizzy and may upset your stomach. Discuss pentoxifylline with your doctor, and be sure to tell them the following:If you’re allergic to caffeine or any drugs
What medications you’re taking, especially any blood-thinners (anticoagulants)
If you have or ever had kidney problems
If you’re trying to get pregnant
If you’re having surgery soon

, If standard practices have failed to help thicken your uterine lining, consider working with a specialist to try a newer medical procedure. Treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has improved the endometrium in trials of women preparing for in vitro fertilization. This is a new method that is still being studied, but ask your doctor whether it’s something to consider.

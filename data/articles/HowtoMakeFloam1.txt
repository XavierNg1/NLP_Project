Simply shred the block using a cheese grater.;

Use one teaspoon of borax instead of two for a gooier floam.
Use three teaspoons for a more solid floam that better holds its shape., Measure a quarter cup of room temperature water into a large mixing bowl. Blend in a quarter cup of white craft glue. To color the floam, add a few drops of liquid or paste food coloring.

The exact amount of polystyrene beads can vary. If you want a thicker floam, use more. For a thinner floam, use less.
 Seal the bag securely. Squish the bag between your hands to knead it. After a few minutes of mixing, the floam should become jelly-like. Once it reaches this semi-solid state, your floam is ready for play./images/thumb/7/7e/Make-Floam-Step-6-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Floam-Step-6-Version-4.jpg

, To prevent drying, keep your floam in either the bag you used to make it or transfer it to another airtight container. While it can sit at room temperature for a while, it's best to store the floam in the refrigerator. This will keep it fresh and free of mold for much longer./images/thumb/8/87/Make-Floam-Step-7-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Floam-Step-7-Version-4.jpg

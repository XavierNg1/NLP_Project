Cut 4 2-inch (5.08 cm) lengths of wire.
Make a loop about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) from one end by wrapping it around the round-nose pliers' jaw.
Wrap the short end around the length of the wire twice, just below the loop. Repeat at the other end of the wire.
Cut the excess wire and press it against the bar with the chain-nose pliers. File the ends smooth, if necessary.


Cut 5 1-inch (2.54 cm) lengths of wire.
Make a loop at one end.
Thread a bead on the wire.
Make a loop at the other end of the wire, next to the bead.
Cut off the excess wire.


Open the loop on one end of a bead unit.
Slide one loop of a bar onto the bead unit's loop, and close the loop. Repeat, alternating bead units and bars, until you have joined all the components, ending with a bead unit.
Open the loops on the end bead units, and attach them to a toggle clasp. Close the loops.

 Choose cards that are interesting, large and easy to transform into a puzzle.


Avoid using cards that have glitter, moving parts etc., as these will be either messier or harder to work with.;
,, Take a digital photo of the card before it is cut. Print a complete picture out as the guide for each puzzle.
 Use your imagination to form shapes, or follow common patterns in a jigsaw puzzle.


The amount of pieces will depend on how difficult you want the puzzle to be and how patient you are with cutting out the pieces. For an easier puzzle, 5 to 6 puzzles is great; for a harder puzzle, make up to 25 pieces.
 Use a pair of small, sharp scissors suitable for cutting paper. Cut carefully to prevent tears or poor fit.
 Glue or staple the printed image to the outside of the box or resealable bag.


Keep card boxes to use as little jigsaw boxes.
,,, The winner is the player with the most correctly assembled cards.

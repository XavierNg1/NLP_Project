 There are various other plants that can be planted in Minecraft. Each of these has specific planting requirements. For example, saplings, sugar cane, cactus, vines, cocoa pods etc.


Saplings: Obtain by breaking leaves. Plant in dirt or grass.
Sugar cane: Obtain in the wild, next to rivers. Plant next to water.
Cocoa pods: Found on jungle trees. Plant on jungle wood.
Vines: Found on jungle trees. Plant anywhere. Harvest with shears.
Cactus: Found in deserts. Plant on sand. Harvest with caution––ouch!
Mushrooms: Found in swamps, caves and other places. Plant in the dark.
Nether wart: Found in nether fortresses. Plant on soul sand.
Flowers: Found in the wild on grass. Plant on grass; you can really only transfer a flower from one place to another. Or, you can obtain bonemeal and right click on the ground and you might get a flower if you're lucky.

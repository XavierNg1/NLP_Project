If you are unable to find a wreath form, you can make your own out of strong cardboard. Place the cardboard on a table and trace a circular form into it. Make sure the circle is at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick. Use a box cutter to cut out the outside circle and then cut out the inside circle.;
, Cut them into strips that are approximately 10 inches to 1 foot (0.30 m) (25.4 to 30.5 cm) long. They can be in different widths, because a rag wreath should appear varied in its colors and pattern.


For an even bolder design, choose fabric scraps in complimentary colors of red, green and white. You can take fabric from your own scrap pile or find many different designs at a fabric store.
 You may need to cut more later on, if you want your wreath to look fuller.
 Tie it in a double knot, so that it stays firmly in place. Allow the ends to fall open.
 Push it close to the last knot. Continue adding strips of different fabrics and knotting them close together.


If you are using a metal or wicker wreath frame that has a few different parallel pieces of frame, you can wrap them around different bars to make the wreath full and varied.
 Fluff the ribbons on the front to see how it will look.
, Tie it in a knot and cut off the ends. Tuck the front part of hanger fabric behind the other cloth knots.
 Attach holly sprigs, fake poinsettia flowers, ornaments, red or green buttons and more with a hot glue gun.
 Allow it to dry before hanging.

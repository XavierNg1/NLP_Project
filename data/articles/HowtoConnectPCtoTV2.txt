 VGA and S-Video only deliver video signals, so you'll need to get sound from your computer to your TV with a different source.

If you wish to use VGA with a Mac, you'll need a DVI to VGA adapter or an Apple Display to VGA adapter.
,,

If using an adapter, connect the adapter to your computer.


This will typically be a 3.5 mm mini-jack port.
, It's a button on the remote or on the TV itself and is typically labeled "Input" or "Source.",

If you don't see video, check your computer's video output/monitor settings and make sure that VGA, S-Video, or the port to which the adapter is connected, is selected.
If you don't hear any sound: (1) Make sure the volume is up and mute is off on both the TV and your computer; and (2) Check your computer audio output or sound settings to make sure that the output is set to the headphone jack.

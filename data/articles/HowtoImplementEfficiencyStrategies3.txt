 Take a broad view of company efficiency and try to identify at least four to five efficiency gaps you would like employees to focus on for the fiscal year. This will ensure your goals are current every year and can build off the goals of the previous year.


You may have company efficiency goals like improving the work environment by switching to a more sophisticated computer program or computing system, reducing the amount of paper waste produced in the office, providing better compensation for long standing employees, and ensuring clients receive more effective project management from employees.
Once you have identified the key efficiency gaps for the year, assign one goal to each department or area in the company. This will ensure it is clear who is accountable for addressing the gap and increase the likelihood that the gap will be addressed.
 Most companies can improve their efficiency by improving their technology every year, from upgrading to faster computers to investing in several scanners or printers for use in the office. Focusing on the latest technology will keep operational efficiency high and allow your employees to work to their full potential.If you have growing IT needs and demands, you may want to consider outsourcing your IT needs to a contractor or outside company. This may be a necessary expense if the company is not able to keep up with the IT needs of clients and employees, and allow your company to focus on providing excellent customer service and meeting deadlines, rather than IT issues.
 Use feedback from your clients and your employees to add to the companyâ€™s efficiency goals and make sure these goals are up to date and current. Let your employees and your clients know that they are active participants in implementing efficiency strategies at the company and that you rely on them to help the company become more efficient.

 Flat screens and LCDs are usually equipped with an HDMI port. If you have an older TV that you want to hook up to your Macbook Pro, you may need to skip to the method below.;
, To connect your Macbook Pro to a HDTV, you will need:

An HDMI cable






A Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter. Two caveats:






If you have a Retina Display MacBook Pro, you will not need this, as this computer comes with an HDMI connection built in.
Some Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapters come with audio support. If you purchase one of these, you won't need a separate cable to get sound.


A 3.5 mm to 3 RCA AV Audio cable to connect sound from your laptop to your computer.
 Hook the two cords together.


If you have a Retina Display Macbook Pro, connect the HDMI cable straight from the Macbook to the HDMI port in the TV.
,, If not using a Mini DisplayPort that supports audio, hook the 3.5mm plug into your Audio Out or headphone jack on your Macbook Pro, and then the Audio component of the cord into the TV.


When connecting the audio to your TV, you may need to change the settings on your TV. Make sure that your audio is not coming in from your HDMI cable (digital) if your HDMI cable does not support audio. Change the audio settings from digital to video to get your audio up and working.
 You should be able to watch videos from your computer on your TV, with sound included.

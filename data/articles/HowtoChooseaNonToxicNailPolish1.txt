 Toluene, formaldehyde, and dibutyl phthalate are known as the “toxic trio.” Polishes labeled as 3-free are free of these chemicals, which can irritate your eyes, skin, nose, and throat and cause long-term damage to your body. For example, formaldehyde can cause cancer and toluene can damage your liver and kidneys.Brands including Essie and OPI specialize in 3-free polish.;
, Nail polish that is labeled as 5-free does not contain the “toxic trio,” but goes beyond avoiding these chemicals. Five-free nail polishes are free of formaldehyde, toluene, DBP, formaldehyde resin, and camphor.Bliss, Chanel, Dior, Jinsoon, and Nailing Hollywood make high quality 5-free nail polishes.
 Many companies are going beyond removing the toxic trio from their products. Nail polishes labeled as 7-free do not contain formaldehyde, toluene, DBP, formaldehyde resin, camphor, ethyl tosylamide, or xylene.Companies like Butter and Pacifica make 7-free polish.
 If you want to avoid a wide range of toxic ingredients in your nail polish, opt for an 8-free product. These nail polishes are free from formaldehyde, toluene, DBP, formaldehyde resin, camphor, xylene, ethyl tosylamide, and triphenyl phosphate.Try a polish from Smith & Cult, Butter, or Lakur for a reliable 8-free product.

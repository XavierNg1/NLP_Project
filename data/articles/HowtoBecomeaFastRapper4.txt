 The best lyrics transform thoughts into words.Keep your lyrics simple enough for everyone to understand. Listeners should not need a dictionary to understand your songs. Come up with creative rhymes as much as possible.


Great lyrics can combine original imagery with unique thoughts that express your unique views on the world. A good example is this verse from Lil' Wayne.

"I'm probably in the sky flying with the fishes / Or maybe in the ocean swimming with the pigeons / See my World is Different"



, To perform you should know the song forward and backwards. It is impossible to rap very fast when you aren’t certain of the next line. By the time you are ready to perform you should know the lyrics as well as you know your own address or phone number.
 Fast rappers are all unique in their performance and you should be as well. Use your training and knowledge to perform songs that reflect upon your influences in addition to your own unique approach. It’s not just about how fast you are, but how you are fast.


The style of delivery should reflect how you are as person: maybe you're chill, intense or stylish.These attributes should be reflected in your performance.
Perform with confidence, and if you lack confidence, then fake it.If you don't seem confident in your music or yourself, your audience won't buy into your act either. Part of being a great performer is selling the act to the audience.

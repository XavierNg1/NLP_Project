 Locate the app icon on your home screen or app drawer. It’s the blue icon with a white padlock. Tap to open.


If you don’t have My Passwords yet, you can download it for free on Google Play.
 The master password is the password used to access all the passwords saved in the app. Do not lose or forget this password; if you do lose or forget it, you cannot reset the master password when you access the app, and you will not be able to recover the passwords saved in the app.


Enter the master password in the first field and repeat the same password in the second field. Make sure that you create a strong alphanumeric password for better security.
Tap “Register” when you’re done.
 Tap the circle with the plus icon at the bottom right corner to open the New Password window. Here you can add information regarding the account for the password you will be saving.
 In the New Password window, you have to enter details in the first 3 fields: Title, Account, and Password. The rest of the fields are optional.
 When you’re done, tap the checkmark at the top right side of the window, and you will be taken back to the app’s main screen.


You can repeat steps 3 to 5 if you want to add more passwords from different accounts.
If you exit the app and then access it again to view your passwords, you must enter the master password you created in step 2.

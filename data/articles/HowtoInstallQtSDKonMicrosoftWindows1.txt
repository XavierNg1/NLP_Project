 Preparing your Windows operating system for Qt application development



Download the Qt SDK. Select the Windows version and be prepared for a long download depending on your Internet speed. I would suggest you select the off-line installation of the Qt SDK if you do not have a very fast internet connection. The complete Qt SDK for the Windows operating system is 1.7 GB which can take over 6 hours on a slow connection.;
, Once the Qt SDK executable is installed you will need to edit the Windows system PATH so that the Windows operating system can find the Qt commands from the command line. Be careful editing your Windows system PATH.

 This will be your pattern.;

Put removable tape on the back of the stencil, and attach it to the leather if slipping occurs.
 Do not use regular scissors, because doing so can damage both the scissors and the leather.
 Some ideas are below:


Punch a hole at the top of your bookmark using a leather punch. Thread a short piece of leather lace through and tie it together at the top.

Stamp or carve a design in your bookmark
Punch holes with a leather punch an equal distance apart all the way around the outside edge of the bookmark. Thread a piece of ribbon or leather lace through the holes and tie it off.

Dye your leather with specialty leather dyes, or oil it for a darker finish.
Bevel the edges of your bookmark for a smooth finish.

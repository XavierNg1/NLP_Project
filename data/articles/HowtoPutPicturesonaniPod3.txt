 Use your preferred email program or website and compose an email to your own email address. Make sure it's an email address that you have configured on your iPod Touch. Create the message on your computer so that you attach the images you want.


If you only want to transfer a few pictures, email may be the easiest method.
 Your email service may limit you to 20-25 MB, which means you may only be able to send a few pictures. You can attach files by clicking the "Attachments" button in your email program.
 Depending on how many pictures you're sending, the message may take a few moments to send.
 Open your Mail app on your iPod Touch. You should see your message in your inbox. Tap it to open it.
 Tap one of the images from the email message to open it. Press and hold the image, and then select the "Save Image" option that appears. The image will be saved to your Camera Roll, which can be accessed from the Photos app.

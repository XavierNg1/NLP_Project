 Don’t just rush up to her to ask if she’ll be your valentine. Figure out when you can have a few quiet moments together during the day if you see her regularly. Call her when you know she’ll be home.
 Don’t worry too much about what to say. Tell her you’d like her to be your valentine. If you want to add anything, list a few of the things you like about her. You’d could also remind her of things you have in common or enjoy doing together.


Focus on saying things you like about her as a person. Try saying things like, “I like how nice you are to other people” or “I admire your confidence” or “You’re really creative and funny.”
Remember to tell her how nice she looks.
 Work up your courage to ask her in person by rehearsing what you want to say. Be calm and confident. Don’t worry about what she might be looking for in a valentine and focus on being yourself.Start by saying hi: “Hi, it’s so good to see you!”
Show an interest in her by asking “How are you?”
Be sure to tell her you’d like to spend time together on Valentine’s Day: “I’d love to get together on Valentine’s.”

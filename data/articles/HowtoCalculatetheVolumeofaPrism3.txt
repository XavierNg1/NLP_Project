 The formula is simply V = length * width * height. A rectangular prism is a prism with a rectangular base.
 The length is the longest side of the flat surface of the rectangle on the top or bottom of the rectangular prism.


Ex: Length = 10 cm.
 The width of the rectangular prism is the shorter side of the flat surface of the rectangle on the top or bottom of the shape.


Ex: Width = in 8 cm.
 The height is the part of the rectangular prism that rises up. You can imagine the height of the rectangular prism as the part that stretches up a flat rectangle and makes it three-dimensional.


Ex: Height = 5 cm.
 You can multiply them in any order to get the same result. Using this method, you have essentially found the area of the rectangular base ( 10 x 8) and then have multiplied it by its height, 5. But to find the volume of this prism, you can multiply the lengths of the sides in any order.


Ex: 10 cm. * 8 cm. * 5 cm = 400 cm.3


, The final answer is 400 cm.3

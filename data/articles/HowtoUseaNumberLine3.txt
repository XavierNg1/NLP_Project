 Find which number is the first number in the problem and which is second.


In the problem 7 - 2, 7 is the first number in the problem and 2 is the second number in the problem.
 Put your finger there.


If your math problem was 7 - 2, you would start by putting your finger on 7 on your number line.
 You have now moved 1 space.


For example: if you start at 7, when you reach 6, you've traveled 1 space.
 This will make sure you end on the answer to your problem.


If the second number in your problem is 2, you should have moved your finger to the left two spaces.
 That is the answer to your subtraction problem.


For example, in the problem 7 - 2, you would have started your problem at 7 on your number line. You would have moved 2 positions to the left, ending with your finger on 5 on your number line. 7 - 2 = 5.
 This is to check your answer.


If you get a different result from your check, try again to see where you made a mistake.

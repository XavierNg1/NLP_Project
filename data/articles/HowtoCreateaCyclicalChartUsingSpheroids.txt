If the chart is not turning out, try substituting a 2 for one of the last two numbers. However, this may result in non-spheres. The choice was made for a partial curve."
D2: Input "=VLOOKUP(ABS(Spheroids2),LOOKER,IF(Spheroids2<=24,3,2))"; Insert New Comment and edit in "Original formula =VLOOKUP(ABS(Spheroids2),LOOKER,IF(Spheroids2<=24,3,2)). If the chart is not turning out, try substituting a 2 for one of the last two numbers. However, this may result in non-spheres. The choice was made for a partial ring."
E2: Input 1. This variable, Number, is not being used at present. It's purpose is to warp or skew the output via incorporation into the formulas in cell range C6: I2886. Insert a New Comment if you like.
F2: Input "=1954/9/2". This variable, NewDate1, is not being used at present. It's purpose is to warp or skew the output personally via incorporation into the formulas in cell range C6: I2886. It is a birth date in format yyyy/mm/dd, i.e. a double quotient. Insert a New Comment if you like.

B4: Input "=16*107". Insert New Comment and edit in "Original constant value =16*107."
C4: Input 24. Do Insert New Comment and edit in comment "See Lookup Tables for range of Spheroids values contemplated by this worksheet." Expand the comment frame if need be.
D4: Input 1. Do Insert New Comment and edit in comment "Input 1 if keeping input data for Spheroids normalized, else 2 to shrink by 1/2, or .5 to expand by a factor of 2, since ShrinkExpand is a Divisor." Expand the comment frame if need be.
E4: Input 180. Do Insert New Comment and edit in comment "Normally this will not be changed, but can be for warping effects. Original value 180". Expand the comment frame if need be.
F4: Input "=(1958/4/13)". This variable, NewDate2, is not being used at present. It's purpose is to warp or skew the output personally via incorporation into the formulas in cell range C6: I2886. It is a birth date in format yyyy/mm/dd, i.e. a double quotient. Insert a New Comment if you like.
G4: Input "=16*107". Insert New Comment and edit in "Original constant value =16*107."
H4: Input "=Spheroids". Insert New Comment and edit in "=Spheroids is original formula because most often Spheroids2 is the Standard or Goal for Spheroids, and needs to correspond per period on a 1:1 basis." Expand the comment frame if need be.
I4: Input the formula "=ShrinkExpand". Insert New Comment and edit in "Original formula =ShrinkExpand is most usual value as Standard or Goal, e.g. 100% of Normal. But if 80% of Normal is the New Goal, say for a Personal Fitness Program, then a little math is required.  ShrinkExpand2 = 1/.80, or 1.25 would be the new input. This is because it was thought the natural trend would be to want to shrink by say a factor of 2, so 2 = 1/.50 and the New Goal is to be 50% of Normal, or shrink by a factor of 2 (as a divisor). You may change the formulas and comments so that ShrinkExpand and ShrinkExpand2 are multiplicative instead of divisive if preferred." Expand the comment frame if need be.
 A5: Base t; B5: c; C5: Cos; D5: Sin; E5: Main X; F5: Main Y; G5: Count2; H5: Second X; I5: Second Y. Select cell range A5:I5 and Format Cell Font Underline.

 Expand the comment frame if need be. Do Format Cell Fill Light Rose color to distinguish it from the other cells in the column.
Edit Go To cell range A7:A2886 and with A7 the active high-lighted cell, input "=((A6+(-Tip*2)/(AjRows)))" and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell A7 and copy the the formula in the formula bar and do Insert New Comment and edit comment "Original formula "=((A6+(-Tip*2)/(AjRows))) to bottom A2886 (as adjusts per cell on the way down)". Expand the comment frame if need be.
Cell B6: Input "=IF(Spheroids<=24,Base*24/Spheroids,Base*24/Spheres)" and Insert New Comment and edit in "Original formula =IF(Spheroids<=24,Base*24/Spheroids,Base*24/Spheres)". Expand the comment frame if need be. Format Cells Fill Light Rose - to make it distinct from other cells in same column with different formula.
Edit Go To cell range B7:B2886 and with B7 the active high-lighted cell, input "=B6" and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell B7 and copy the the formula in the formula bar and do Insert New Comment and edit comment "Original formula =B6 to bottom B2886 (as adjusts per cell on the way down)". Expand the comment frame if need be.
Edit Go To cell range C6:C2886 and with C6 the active high-lighted cell input "=Spheroids/KEY*(COS((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))" and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell C6 and do Insert New Comment and edit it "Original Formula =Spheroids/KEY*(COS((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))". Expand the comment frame if need be. This formula and the next one form the ring the Spheroids occupy, By taking the cosine of the cell 6 rows above the cell it's in, C6, the formula is taking the cosine of 0, which = 1.
Edit Go To cell range D6:D2886 and with D6 the active high-lighted cell input "=Spheroids/KEY*(SIN((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))" and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell D6 and do Insert New Comment and edit it "Original Formula =Spheroids/KEY*(SIN((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1)). By taking the sine of the cell 6 rows above the cell we're in, C6, the formula is taking the sine of 0, which = 0. Therefore, between the formula in C6 and the one in D6, the {x,y} coordinates of the first cell are {1,0}. It proceeds counterclockwise from there. so that is how to read the chart, from 0 degrees counterclockwise back to 360 degrees. Even though there are basically 2880 rows being charted, and 2880/360 = 8, the factor = 1/8th at .125, so a level of detail is achieved while keeping everything normalized for a single cycle in the typical case.
Edit Go To cell range E6:E2886 and with E6 the active high-lighted cell, input the formula, "=((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*COS(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+C6)*VLOOKUP(ROW(),SPREADLooker,3)/ShrinkExpand" w/o quote marks and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell E6 and do Insert New Comment "Original Formula =((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*COS(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+C6)*VLOOKUP(ROW(),SPREADLooker,3)/ShrinkExpand multiplies each term of the standard formula for a spherical helix per 'CRC Standard Curves and Surfaces' by David von Seggern,  1993, by GM (Golden Mean) to keep things proportional, with the z dimension added into the x and y dimensions. This is then multiplied by the Lookup Table SPREADLooker, which either randomizes the data or accepts inputs per the Goal Lookup worksheet. Lastly, it is subject to ShrinkExpand, a variable for normalizing or growing or shrinking its chart relative to the Standard or Goal chart data series of Second X and Second Y." Expand the comment frame as much as necessary. I realize that there will be NAME error values -- these will be fixed in a little while.
Edit Go To cell range F6:F2886 and with F6 the active high-lighted cell, input the formula,"=((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*SIN(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+D6)*VLOOKUP(ROW(),SPREADLooker,3)/ShrinkExpand" w/o quote marks and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell F6 and do Insert New Comment "Original Formula =((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*SIN(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+D6)*VLOOKUP(ROW(),SPREADLooker,3)/ShrinkExpand (see note in E6 for details)." I realize that there will be NAME error values -- these will be fixed in a little while.
Cell G6: Input "=IF(Spheroids2<=24,Base2*24/Spheroids2,Base2*24/Spheroids2)" w/o quotes. Insert New Comment and edit in "Original formula =IF(Spheroids2<=24,Base2*24/Spheroids2,Base2*24/Spheroids2) which is redundant but being worked on." Expand the Comment frame as needed. Format Cell Fill Light Blue as the next cells have a different formula.
Edit Go To cell range G7:G2886 and with G7 the active high-lighted cell, input the formula,"=G6". Do Insert New comment and edit in "Original Formula =G6 down to G2886 as adjusts per cell thereto."
Edit Go To cell range H6:H2886 and with H6 the active high-lighted cell, input the formula,"=((SIN(A6/(G6*2))*GM*COS(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(G6*2)))*GM)+Spheroids2/KEY2_*(COS((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor2)))/ShrinkExpand2*IF(Spheroids<=15,2,IF(Spheroids>=40,0.5,1))" w/o quotes. Do Insert Comment and edit comment "Original formula =((SIN(A6/(G6*2))*GM*COS(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(G6*2)))*GM)+Spheroids2/KEY2_*(COS((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor2)))/ShrinkExpand2*IF(Spheroids<=15,2,IF(Spheroids>=40,0.5,1)) with ShrinkExpand2 being the Goal or Standard the Spheroids of Main X and Main Y are to attain." See Step 25 for notes on ShrinkExpand2.Expand the comment frame if need be.
Edit Go To cell range I6:I2886 and with I6 the active high-lighted cell, input the formula,"=((SIN(A6/(G6*2))*GM*SIN(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(G6*2)))*GM)+Spheroids2/KEY2_*(SIN((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor2)))/ShrinkExpand2*IF(Spheroids<=15,2,IF(Spheroids>=40,0.5,1))" w/o quotes. Do Insert Comment and edit comment "Original formula =((SIN(A6/(G6*2))*GM*SIN(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(G6*2)))*GM)+Spheroids2/KEY2_*(SIN((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor2)))/ShrinkExpand2*IF(Spheroids<=15,2,IF(Spheroids>=40,0.5,1)) with ShrinkExpand2 being the Goal or Standard the Spheroids of Main X and Main Y are to attain."

Select cell U6 and input the formula, "=(6+AjRows/(Spheroids))/DIVIDED_BY". Do Insert New Comment and edit in "Original formula =(6+AjRows/(Spheroids))/DIVIDED_BY So, in the case of 24 Spheroids and 2880 AjRows, 2880/24 = 120 + 6 = 126. The original Vlookup formula finds which row() it's currently in and compares it to this number, thus bracketing the data into groups."

Edit Go To cell range A2:A101 and with A2 the active high-lighted cell, input 1, then do Edit Fill Series Columns Linear Step Value 1 OK.
Edit Go To cell range C2:C65 and input .33 into cell C2 and do shift+tab and input -.33 into cell C65 and do Edit Fill Series Column accept the proposed Step Value (-.01) OK. select cell C101 and input 0. Then Edit Go To cell range C65:C101 and do Edit Fill Series Columns Linear Accept proposed Step Value OK. You can copy these values and do Paste Special Values into cell range B2:B65 to see the small spiral effect on the chart.
Edit Go To E2:E101 and input 1.5 into cell E2 and do shift+tab and input 0 into cell E101 and do Edit Fill Series Column accept the proposed Step Value OK. You can copy these values and do Paste Special Values into cell range B2:B65 to see the large spiral effect on the chart. You may notice that since there are 24 divisions of 2880 due to 24 being the number of Spheroids, that if you look across from 24 in column B or E that the last value is .95, not the bottom value of 0. It's possible to do Insert New Comment about this at the top on the label Spiral or in the first active formula cell.
Edit Go To D2:D101 and with D2 the active high-lighted cell, enter the formula "=RANDBETWEEN(60,98)/100" and do Edit Fill Down. You can copy these values and do Paste Special Values into cell range B2:B65 to see the random effect on the chart. Do Insert New Comment into cell D2 and edit in "Original formula =RANDBETWEEN(60,98)/100 but =RANDBETWEEN(40,150)/100 also works just fine -- it just creates a larger spread of random numbers is all."
Copy and Paste Values of D2:D101 into B2:B101 for now to create a random data spread.
You are ready to enter live data (e.g. diabetes data) into column B (B2:B101) of the Goal Lookup worksheet, where it will be treated as PERFORMANCE INPUTS in Main X and Main Y vs. the Standard in Second X and Second Y. Go check the DATA worksheet and see that all the errors have vanished. If not, see Tips below please. You may leave the data as random for now.
 Either do Chart Wizard or select Chart on the Ribbon (activated in Preferences) and select All, Scattered, Smoothed Line Scattered. If using Chart Wizard, a new Chart worksheet will be created. Otherwise, copy or cut and paste the chart into the upper left corner of the Chart worksheet you created at the beginning, and hover the mouse over the lower right corner until it becomes a double-headed arrow and then use it to pull the chart into an expansion of a large Square.
On the Chart worksheet, do menuitem Chart Add Data. In response to the Range request, activate the Data worksheet again and Edit Go To under Second X and Second Y cell range H6:I2886. When I do it, it does not work right and it takes column E instead of column H. Click on the second standard ring series, or double-click until it appears in the formula bar and edit it until it reads as follows: =SERIES(,Data!$H$6:$H$2886,Data!$I$6:$I$2886,2)
The first series, after clicking on it, should read as follows: =SERIES(,Data!$E$6:$E$2886,Data!$F$6:$F$2886,1). Any other series which Excel created should be deleted by clicking on it and deleting it from the Formula Bar.
Edit Series 1 ( the one with the last digit = to 1 in the series formula, and the one randomized or input by you or spirallic) by double-clicking on it for line weight = .25, glow = canary yellow size 8 point 25% transparent, if you want to start off resembling mine.
Edit the line of Series 2 to be dashed and 1 point line weight and Foresty Green to Lawn Green to Leafy Green in hue. It's a yellowish-green, not a blue-green.
Double-click on the Plot Area and set the Gradient to be Radial, Centered, Dark Purple on left and Prussian Blue on right. My pigments are all put away right now or it would be easier to say if it was Prussian, Cerulean, Ultramarine, Cobalt or some other blue. Sorry - get them mixed up. I have No Line set for either the Plot Area or the Chart Area, no Chart Titles, No Axes which are all controlled by Chart Layout (which appears on the Ribbon when you click on the Chart Plot Area).

 Each image was copied, opened in Preview via File - New from Clipboard. Each was exported as a JPG file to my wikiHow folder under similar filenames. Then do Insert Photo Picture from File in Excel and select each picture and place it beside the last one by moving columns to align with sides of images. Then adjust the final Row Height to match, slip the cursor underneath, hold down the Shift Key, move the cursor to the opposite corner and slide it under, then Copy. Open again in Preview with all three side by side and there's the Cyclical Progress Chart, voilá!, The top graphic shows, from right to left, the same pattern. But the underlying standard or goal changes: 1) in the first image on the right, the diabetic is exceeding normal parameters apparently by a factor of 2 -- the blood glucose level would be about 200 on average where 100 is the norm; 2) in the center image, the diabetic hits some dangerous lows and risks going comatose, so insulin is probably increased and/or glyburide is taken at mealtime; 3) in the leftmost image, the diabetic has achieved normal blood glucose readings with fairly acceptable fluctuations, but needs close monitoring daily, at least twice a day at the very least. The diabetic needs to keep some energy bars and orange juice on hand in case of sudden drops in blood sugar with attendant shakes and possible headaches. If this level can be maintained, this diabetic might be a good candidate for an exercise and weight loss program, possibly starting with some non-stressful yoga. All in all, the chart shows the diabetic ate about the same food, but less of it apparently, as the same cycle was maintained over the research periods. If the chart is a 24 hour clock, 0 degrees to the right might be 12 AM, 90 degrees straight up would be 6 AM, et cetera, and one can see that a midnight snack and a more well-rounded breakfast would probably be good ideas.

Or, the same charts, read left to right, would mean a diabetic who was under control has lost control and is at serious risk currently due to overindulging on their favorite and usual menu.

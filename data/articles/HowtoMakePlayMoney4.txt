 Using any internet search you can find a number of website offering kids play money for free online. You can choose which template you like and download it.
 Once you have found a template that appeals to you, copy and paste the picture onto Microsoft Word or another text program. You can then change the size of the template by clicking on the image and dragging the box in the top left corner of the image. This will alter the size.


If you’re printing a lot of play money copy and paste the image multiple times. Try to fill the page with the image to avoid wasting paper when you print it out.
Make sure you print double sided. When you press print, select 'Print double-sided' in the preview menu'. This way the money will be printed on both sides and you'll be able to cut it out easily.
You also can glue two identical pieces of play money together if you are unable to print double sided.
 You can also find pre-printed play money that you can buy in bulk online. Search “buy play money” in your internet browser and you’ll see there are a ton of options.


You can buy cases with a variety of denominations and cut down on the work for yourself.

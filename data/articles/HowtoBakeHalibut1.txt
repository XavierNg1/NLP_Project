You could also line the dish with a sheet of parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil.;
, Drizzle each fillet with approximately 1 tsp (5 ml) of olive oil or butter, followed by 1/2 tsp (7.5 ml) of lemon juice.


If you're using halibut fillets with the skin still attached, arrange the fillets with the skin-side down. For skinless fillets, it doesn't matter which side faces up.
 Evenly sprinkle each fillet with garlic powder, black pepper, and freshly chopped parsley.


Use 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of chopped parsley if it's fresh. If it's dry, however, drop this amount to 2 tsp (10 ml).
 Place the prepared halibut in the preheated oven and bake it for about 15 minutes, or until the flesh flakes easily when you pierce the center of the fish with a fork.


Peek at the fish through the window of the oven door after 7 or 8 minutes pass. If the top looks dry and the oil/butter has pooled at the bottom of the baking dish, quickly spoon the fat over each fillet and continue baking.
Note that you should not rotate or flip the fillets during the baking process.
 Remove the finished halibut from the oven and enjoy it immediately.


Consider serving each serving of fish with lemon wedges or a fresh squeeze of lemon juice.

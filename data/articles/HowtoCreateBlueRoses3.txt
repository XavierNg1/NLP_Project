 To spray paint the roses blue, you will need blue floral spray paint, fresh white roses, a drop cloth, and a well-ventilated workspace. Spray paint can get messy so you will want to wear clothes that you don’t mind getting paint on.Floral spray paint should be available at craft stores, your local florist, or online.
Regular spray paint is not recommended for this as it will kill the rose quickly.
 To protect your work area from getting painted as well, you will want to cover everything with newspaper or painting cloths. Your workspace must also be well-ventilated to protect you from the fumes of the paint.For best results, do this on a moderate temperature (70°F) day with low humidity.
Working in the garage with the door open or even outside on a nice day would be the best place to do this.
 It is recommended to remove the thorns from the roses before beginning to avoid injury. Although not necessary to the dyeing process, the thorns can be very sharp and make the roses difficult to handle especially when arranging them at the end.Take care not to damage the actual stem of the rose when removing the thorns.
Thorns can be cut away using scissors, a knife, or a de-thorning tool.
 Shake the can well before starting to spray. Hold the can about 15–18 inches (38–46 cm) away from the flower and make sure the nozzle is pointing towards the flower blossom. Spray the blossom while rotating it to evenly coat.Make sure you get the insides of the petals as well as the outside.
Set the flower aside and let it dry completely.
 Once the paint has dried completely, you can paint them again until you get the color to the darkness that you’re looking for. Paint should take about an hour to dry. For best results, make sure you let the paint dry between coats.Let all flowers dry completely before arranging them.

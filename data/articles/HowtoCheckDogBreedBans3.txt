 In most areas, landlords can ban any pets they want. You don't have a right to own a certain type of dog on another person's property. Therefore, it's always best to ask about your dog before signing a rental agreement. The landlord may ban certain breeds, and your dog may not be allowed to live there.Most landlords require you to sign a pet agreement. If you don't sign one, you may have more leeway under the law to keep a breed your landlord bans.
Keep in mind that some landlords may ban certain breeds out of necessity, due to the insurance they carry.
 Have evidence ahead of time that your dog isn't trouble or a nuisance. You can have a letter from your vet, for instance, stating that your dog is not violent or destructive. You could also have letters from previous landlords or neighbors who can attest to the fact that your dog is generally good. Also, make sure to lay out how you've trained your dog, as well as what you do when you're working (such as crate the dog).Also, lay out any way you plan to protect the place you're renting from your dog.
 Usually, landlords have rules in place because they've been burned in the past. Besides, getting angry won't help. You may be able to persuade a reluctant landlord if you are calm and reasonable, but if you start yelling, you shut down any chances you may have of renting there with your dog.

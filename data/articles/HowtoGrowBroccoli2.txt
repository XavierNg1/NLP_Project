 Usually this will take about six weeks. The height and plant development are more important than the duration of the germination process.
 Make sure you have completed the proper soil preparation methods outlined above before transplanting your seedlings, including fertilizing the soil.

 For summer plantings, apply an organic mulch of compost, leaves, or bark to keep soil cool. For winter plantings, apply a black plastic covering to heat the soil.,

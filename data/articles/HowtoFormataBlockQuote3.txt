 Block quotes should be used sparingly throughout your paper, and be sure to elaborate on their context so teachers and professors know that you’ve understood the work.In CMS, you can use a block quote for shorter amounts of text for stylistic purposes.
 Place a colon at the end of the sentence that leads up to the block quote. For example, Dean et al. (2017) found that grass fed cattle produce higher quality meat: (your block quote will come next).


In CMS, you can use a period or nothing after the sentence that leads up to the block quote, but a colon is most common., After you’ve introduced your quote, begin the quote on a new line., Moving from the left margin, you’ll want to indent the entire quote by 5 spaces (½ inch or 1.27 cm). For most computers and writing applications, you can achieve this indent by hitting the “tab” button.If you are citing multiple paragraphs, indent the first line of the quotation based on the way it is indented in the original text.Indent the first line of each successive paragraph the same way.
 Because you are starting the block quote on a new line with indentation that is separate from your text, you don’t need to add quotation marks to set it apart from the main body of your paper., Block quotes are usually single-spaced in CMS, but it’s not required.Double-spacing is also acceptable., It’s very important to properly cite where the original quote came from. Unlike MLA and APA formatting, CMS uses footnotes to cite references.

For example: The findings suggest the smoking can increase lung cancer risk., Once you’ve finished formatting your quote, you can continue your personal commentary on a new line. If the block quote is part of a larger paragraph of text, simply start a new line after the quote with no indentation.If you want to begin a new text paragraph after the block quote, start a new line and begin your paragraph with a ½ inch indentation from the left margin.

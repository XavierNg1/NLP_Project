 When exercising with a broken wrist, it is recommended you use a sling to maintain the writs in a neutral position. Besides providing protection, the sling prevents the wrist from excess movement that could worsen the injury., The tip of the bandage should stick out farther than your elbow.
 Do this gently so that the tip is pulled toward the shoulder opposite of the affected arm and around your neck.
 Take the part that is hanging down and pull it over the injured arm. The tips should meet behind the neck.
 This step might be impossible for you do to on your own.


Above the collarbone, have your assistant tie the ends to a knot.
 Ask your assistant to adjust the sling so that it supports the arm all the way to your little finger.


Fit the sling around your elbow by twisting the tip with a safety pin or tucking it in.

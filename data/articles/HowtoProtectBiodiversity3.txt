They should put committees in place who figure out what harms the environment and who have the authority to take or recommend action to stop those actions. They should also limit the importation of non-native species, which can be invasive.Laws should criminalize behaviors that harm the environment, especially on the corporate scale., If you don't see enough change, you can make a difference by running for office yourself, and then working towards environmentally friendly laws that conserve the diverse environment.

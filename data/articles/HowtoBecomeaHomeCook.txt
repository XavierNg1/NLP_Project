Plan meals for 1 week at a time. This will save shopping time and you will not get stuck wondering what to make for dinner at the last minute.
Find recipes that appeal to your taste and skill level. The Internet is a great source of recipes and it is easy to use it to find recipes that contain ingredients you already have on hand.;
,


As you shop for ingredients, look for basics that are used in a wide range of recipes and can be stored for long periods of time, such as flour, sugar, vinegar and spices.



In the beginning, you may just have a few things, but over time you can acquire as many cooking tools as fit into your space and budget. Choose tools that can serve more than one purpose in your kitchen.



Read about cooking techniques such as baking, braising, grilling, poaching, roasting, sauteing, stewing, and stir-frying in cookbooks, magazines or on the Internet. You can also watch cooking programs.



Find a time to cook that fits into your schedule. Some people prepare all the meals for a week on one day and then store them to be warmed and assembled when they are to be eaten. Other people shop for, prepare, and cook everything on the same day. These are only examples. What matters is that you find a time that is convenient for you.
Make sure you choose recipes that can be finished in the time you have available.



Read recipes all the way through before starting to cook them. This way you won't be surprised by something as you are preparing the recipe. It can be quite a shock to realize that something needs to rest for an hour before the next step when you are planning to have dinner in 20 minutes.
Prepare and measure your ingredients before beginning a recipe. In cooking this is called "mise en place."
Don't be afraid to experiment with new foods and techniques. A good cookbook should give you adequate guidance to make almost any recipe successfully.

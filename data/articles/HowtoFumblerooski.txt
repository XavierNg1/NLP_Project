 Have the center hike the football.;
, Tell the quarterback to take the ball and place it on the ground — technically a fumble.


Since the ball has been “fumbled,” members of the offensive line—particularly the guards—are now legally able to touch it.
 Have a guard suddenly turn away from the offensive line and pick up the ball.



Have your running back or backs run up one side of the field while the guard runs the opposite direction.
Help sell the play by faking a handoff. Fake a handoff between your quarterback and one of the running backs to help bolster the misdirection.
 Block for the guard as needed. If done quickly and correctly, he should have an open side of the field with no one even watching him.

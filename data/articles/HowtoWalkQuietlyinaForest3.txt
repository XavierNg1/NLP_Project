 Breathe at a steady pace, inhaling and exhaling through the mouth. Forcing air through your nostrils creates more noise than breathing through your mouth.
 If you are trying to walk quietly in a forest, the last thing you want to do is sneeze loudly and give your position away. If you feel an urge to sneeze coming on, there are a few things you can try.Try pressing down hard on your upper lip, just under your nose. Hold your finger there until the urge to sneeze passes.
Hydrate your nose with saline nasal spray before you take your walk – this will prevent sneezes related to dry nasal passages.
Avoid staring directly at sunlight, and wear sunglasses in bright daylight. Sudden exposure to sunlight can trigger a sneeze.
 Check your clothing before you leave the house, to be sure you aren't wearing anything that makes noise. Avoid pants that rustle when you walk, jackets with dangling metal zipper pulls, and backpacks with jangling metal clips or D-rings.
 If you need to cough or rifle through your backpack, try to time this to coincide with other noises around you. A rushing waterfall, an airplane overhead, or a car passing on a road nearby will camouflage small sounds.If you feel a coughing bout coming on, try to hold it until you can mask it with a louder sound – maybe the person you're following will toss their pack to the ground to rest, or you hear a group of riders on horseback approaching down the trail.

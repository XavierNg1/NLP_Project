 If choosing a lethal trap, this is the most humane choice. It works to deliver a powerful snap that will kill a rat instantly. There are many types and brands to choose from, including the original wooden standby that still holds up as the most popular choice. The wooden traps are so popular because you can adjust the pan tension. If you find a smaller rat who cautiously nibbles the bait, you can set the trap to a very light setting.The wooden bottom can sit soundly on insulation if you use them in the attic.Other brands usually have a single high-tension setting with uneven plastic bottoms.;
, While this can be a trickier way to catch a rat, it allows you to get rid of unwanted rodents without killing them. However, these can become tricky because you may need several to help catch the rat, and you may not have the space to place them all out. Also, they can be more expensive than other traps.Once you do catch a rat, you will have to drive to a wooded area at least 2 1⁄2 miles (4.0 km) away to release it.With this trap, you need to check it several times a day. If a rat stays in a live cage trap for too long, it will die of stress exhaustion., These types of traps tend to cause problems and are considered the most inhumane way to catch a rat. It works by gluing the feet and legs of the rat to the trap, and then it holds the rat there until it suffocates or starves to death. Sometimes, the rat will escape, leaving behind chunks of fur or a leg. If you do find a trapped rat there, you will have to deal with discarding a possibly living rat., Bait is not necessary to catch a rat. The main factors in a successful trapping are the location and type of placement you use. However, if you want to use bait, try peanut butter. Technically, you could use anything, but peanut butter is the best thing to use because it stays fresh for long periods, and it won't be easily removed by sneaky rats.

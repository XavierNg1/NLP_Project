You will need a printer which is ready and capable of printing. This means it will need to be properly hooked up to the computer you are printing from, all of the necessary drivers must be installed, and the printer will need to be full of both paper and ink.
Donâ€™t forget to plug it in and turn it on!
Also, be conscious of whether you have an inkjet or a laser printer. They print in different ways and require different materials to print with. Laser printers can print only in black and white.



You will need to determine what type of paper you want to print on before printing. Choose heavier paper for more formal prints (such as invitations or resumes) and thinner paper for basic flyers and other mass prints. This paper will need to be loaded into the appropriate slot, so that it will be used when you go to print. You will also need to determine if you need color or black and white prints.
Make sure that the paper you are using is not too thick for the printer.

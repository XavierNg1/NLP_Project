 Removing the fat from the meat, whether it be chicken, pork, beef, venison, or another type of meat, allows you to can prime cuts rather than wasting space with fat. It also prevents fat from getting on the rim of the jar. Fat that creeps into the lid area can prevent the jar from sealing correctly.
 Rather than canning an entire wedge of meat, it's a good idea to cut it into cubes or strips, so each individual piece gets hot enough during the canning process. As you cut the meat, remove any pieces of bone or gristle.


If you're canning ground meat, you can skip the cubing step. Form the meat into patties or can it loose.
It's easier to cut the meat while it's cold, rather than cutting warm meat., Heat some oil in a cast iron skillet and brown the meat for several minutes on each side. This shrinks the meat, allowing you to pack more in each jar. Browning meat also brings out a good flavor that will improve over time as the meat sits in the jar after canning.


It is not necessary to cook the meat; you can can it raw instead, unless you're canning ground meat.
Season the meat with spices before cooking it if you'd like. You could also wait until you're ready to use the meat to season it.
 Fill it with a few inches of water and place it on the stove. Turn on the heat and let it simmer. Place the lids in the hot water and let them stay there until you're ready to use them., Scoop meat into the jars, stopping two inches below the top of the jar. Pour either water or broth into the jar and fill it to within an inch of the top. You need the extra headspace, so don't fill the jars all the way to the top.
 Use a paper towel soaked in vinegar to wipe the rim of the jars, making sure to remove any traces of fat or oil. Use tongs to lift lids and place them on the jars one at a time. Screw the rings onto the jars so that they are firmly in place.

 If one of your cats has recently been ill or hospitalized, avoid changing its diet unless the vet tells you it’s necessary. Waiting until it’s recovered before switching its food will prevent food aversion and make the transition easier.If you suddenly start feeding a cat new food while it’s sick, it will likely associate the new food with being sick, and it’ll resist its new diet in the future.
 Switching to a new diet abruptly can cause digestive problems, particularly when changing from dry to wet food. Start by feeding your cats their new food at one meal per day and the old food at other daily meals. Gradually work towards feeding them new food at all meals over the course of four to seven days.You can also try mixing the old and new food together. Feed your cat 75 percent old food and 25 percent new on the first day, 50 percent of each on the next day, 25 percent old food on the third, and only new food on the fourth.
 If you have trouble systematically switching your cat’s meals, you can mix old and new food together. Try placing a small amount of the old food on top of the new food. Gradually decrease the amount of the old food you include with each meal until you can omit it completely., If you have any problems getting your cat used to its new diet, you can try adding a tasty, high-value flavor to its new food. Pour in a bit of canned tuna juice or a flavor you’ve observed your cat show preference for in the past.Be sure to ask the vet if it’s okay to add anything to your cat’s food. If your cat is obese or on a prescribed or therapeutic diet, an additive might not be the healthiest choice.
 If you do need to switch your cat’s diet abruptly, you should do so with the vet’s guidance. The vet might find it prudent to keep the cat in their office for two or three days to oversee the diet transition.Keeping the cat with the vet or having it hospitalized during a forced switch will help prevent digestive problems or malnourishment.

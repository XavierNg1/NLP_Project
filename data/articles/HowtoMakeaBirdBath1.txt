 You will need to be able to stack these stones so that they will provide a sturdy base for your bath. Look for stones that are large and relatively flat., Take the stones you have found and stack them, one on top of the other. Try to arrange them so that they are level. It will be a bit like a puzzle, as you try to match the jutting edges in some rocks with the gaps in others., Birds sometimes use bowls lying directly on the ground as birdbaths. They prefer, however, for their birdbaths to be at least a few inches off the ground, but it is not absolutely necessary that they be very high up., Once the stones are relatively level, place a trashcan lid on top of them. You do need to pile the stones very high. Your priority should be creating a level surface for the lid. The lid should be deep enough for you to fill it with 1-2 inches (2-5 cm) of water and wide enough that there is enough room for you to put a large stone in the center and still have space for birds to get inside. It is counterproductive to have more than 2 inches of water in a birdbath.
 Place a heavy stone in the center of the trashcan lid to hold it in place on top of the other stones. Be sure the stone is centered or it will throw the lid off balance. , Once the lid is secure, fill it with water. The birds should show up in no time!

 Inner confidence is a remarkably attractive attribute, which is why it is probably the first and only law of flirtation. But let's be clear: "confidence" doesn't mean arrogance. Confidence means that you are aware of yourself and comfortable with yourself, embodying your positive traits without flaunting them.If you aren't a very confident person, consider building your self confidence. Feeling good in your own skin will help you in all aspects of life, not just your relationship.
 Cracking corny jokes or one-liners can be a great ice-breaker, especially if they flatter his manliness. For example, you can accidentally trip and fall into your man, commenting, "My, your chest is so firm I thought I was falling onto a wall!", Your attempts to introduce something new might elicit a laugh, but don't worry: this is a natural reaction to a break from the status quo. Laughing along with him keeps things playful and reinforces the bonds that keep you together.

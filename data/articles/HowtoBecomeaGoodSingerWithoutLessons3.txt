 Singers don’t have the luxury of replacing their instrument because their body is their instrument. If you’re low on energy, it will affect your body and your voice.Figure out how much sleep you need every night. Make a bedtime and stick to it.
The more energy you have, the more energy you can use to power your voice.
 When your vocal cords are dry, your voice comes out sounding weak and scratchy. In order to keep your voice sounding strong and healthy, drink water consistently throughout the day.Have a glass of water during every meal and another one during a snack.
Carry a water bottle around with you throughout the day so you don’t get thirsty.
 Coffee dehydrates the vocal cords, so singers should stay away. Instead, pour 1 teaspoon of manuka honey into a mug of warm water and add a few drops of lemon to taste.The honey and lemon will help stave off any colds or flus.
Try drinking this every morning with breakfast so you don’t forget.
 Before you can start singing the song you’re working on, you need to warm up your voice. Without warming up, your voice will sound rusty and it’s possible over time you could do actual harm to your vocal cords.Try going up and down scales a few times to warm up.
Loosen your tongue by saying a tongue twister. Try saying “Mama made me mash my M&M’s” ten times, picking up the speed each time.
Warm up your body as well. Singers hold tension in their shoulders, necks, backs, faces and jaws, so stretch and massage those areas to keep them loose.

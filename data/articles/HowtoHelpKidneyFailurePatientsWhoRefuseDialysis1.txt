 Diuretics can decrease edema (swelling of hands and feet) due to excess water in the body. Your doctor should prescribe drugs like hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide in doses specific to the severity of kidney failure. Furosemide is administered in tablet form or IV and is taken every day once a day until the desired effect is obtained.;
, ACE inhibitors, Veno-dilators, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers can help keep your blood pressure at a healthy level. These drugs either dilate the veins or arteries, reducing either the amount of work required of the heart or reducing the amount of blood pumped to the heart.
 Taken before meals, phosphate binders like calcium carbonate or Calcitriol bind phosphate in the stomach and prevent it from being absorbed. A concentration of phosphate in the blood leads to:


weakening of bones and ultimately irreversible damage
skin irritations and itching
muscle cramps due to electrolytes disturbance

, Supplements can help activate the vitamin taken from food or sunlight. The activated form of vitamin D helps regulate both calcium and phosphorus levels in your blood through balancing their absorbance. It also controls parathyroid hormone "PTH" release, which forces your body to increase calcium levels by taking it from bone tissue, which is ultimately not good for you.
 Anemia develops because of a decrease in erythropoietin (EPO) production. EPO help form red blood cells by stimulating bone marrow to produce them. When not enough red blood cells are synthesized, less oxygen is delivered to your vital organs, causing short rapid breath, fatigue, chest pain, confusion or dementia.
 NSAIDs like Ibuprofen and Declofenac salts can harm your kidneys. Ask your doctor to prescribe you other safe analgesics.

 By cooking one dinner per day, rather than a main meal for adults and side meals for children, you can encourage your children to remain open to new foods. Children will be challenged to try foods that adults enjoy, and will therefore be more likely to develop into adults with an openness to diverse food items as opposed to adults with a picky eating habit. As an additional benefit, you will have more time to invest into cooking a tasty and diverse menu with your family., By serving meals at regular intervals, you can ensure your family has an adequate appetite. Choose a time that works for everyone in the family, allows for adequate meal preparation time, and minimizes the time window for snacking., Serving snacks between meal times may lead to a lack of appetite at meal time.If the picky eater is not hungry, they will be less likely to try something new. So, you should focus on creating good healthy meals for picky eaters, and avoid multiple snack times.
 Give small portions of food so that your child will eat appropriate portions and will need to request additional servings based on their appetite.While keeping portions small, remember to include lots of diversity on the plate so that there are opportunities for picky eaters to try new things. You might try integrating small portions of a food item that your child has previously rejected and they may eventually grow over their dislike for this item., It will take time for picky eaters, especially children, to try new foods so donâ€™t give up! It may take ten or fifteen tries before a picky eater tries a new food.

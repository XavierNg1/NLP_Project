 Silvermist is a Water Fairy (hence the name SilverMIST). Take care of water. Try swimming and diving.;
,, Water is blue, of course.
 Sing to them, talk to them, really be kind to any creatures. Have a fish tank at home to put in fish or have a pet turtle.
 Also, have a 'go with the flow' style and be mellow.
 Don't try to do everything so quickly.
 If they aren't kind to you, ignore them. They shouldn't waste your day.

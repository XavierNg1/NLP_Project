 Make a figure-eight with a rubber band, then slip it onto a finger. Stretch the band over the two notches of the mini-loom.
 Put another rubber band in the crook of the hook, then pull it through and out the other side back on the hook.
 Loop a rubber band in the crook and pull the two-band sides that are already on your hook. Repeat until you reach your desired length.
 You can C-clip the ends of the bracelet together, or you can tie a slip knot.

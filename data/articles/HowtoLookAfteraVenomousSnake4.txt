 If you are bitten by your snake, move away from it immediately. It may strike you again.Further bites mean more venom in your bloodstream and an increased risk of death.
 Immediately call 911 or one of the hospitals you have already identified as having anti-venom.Time is of the essence. You need medical assistance immediately.
 The bitten area is likely to swell. Tight clothing or jewelry around the area can be difficult to remove once this happens.,


You can gently clean the wound with a damp towel, but do not flush it with water.Do not attempt to suck the venom out of the wound or otherwise remove the venom. You can end up making matters worse. Do not use a tourniquet., Keeping the wound below the level of your heart will slow the spread of the venom. Keep the wound low, ideally while lying down.


If the snake has bitten your arm, for example, lie on a bed or couch with the bitten arm dangling over the side., Although it may be hard not to panic, you need to stay calm and still while you wait for help. Anxiety and activity will increase your heart rate, speeding the movement of the venom through your body.Do not drink alcohol or caffeine while awaiting help. Alcohol thins the blood, and caffeine raises your heart rate. Both can cause the situation to worsen more rapidly.

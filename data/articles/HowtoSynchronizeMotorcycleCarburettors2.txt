 Maybe you don't have vacuum measuring gauges, are too poor to buy some, or the old horse is just too worn out for them to work correctly? Stuck in the middle of some godforsaken place without any mechanics, workshops, anything? Fear not, my friend, here's the bush method for synching your carbs. All you need is a few little metal balls from an old ball bearing, of about 5mm in diameter, one for each carb, easily found in any scrap yard, and added to your emergency tool kit., If the engine revs higher when you spray a particular spot, that's where an air leak is. Close it with some liquid gasket or chewing gum. Yes, it works, at least for some miles. (Most of the times, this is what caused your previously nicely adjusted carbs to act up in the first place.), Leave them attached to the throttle. Place them, level, over a level cardboard box or something. Put a ball from a ball bearing in each., Stare in wonder at the butterfly valves opening. Listen to the sound of the little balls falling through onto the cardboard - "ploploploplop". Adjust the butterfly valve screws until you hear just one plop. There you you go, carbs are synched up!, Ride off into the sunset!

 Purchase pre-made pie dough from your local grocery store to the quickest and easy way to make pie crust letters. Refrigerated dough is especially easy to work with, though you can also go with a frozen option and thaw it according to the directions on the package.
 Pie crust is notoriously hard to get just right, but by sticking to a proven recipe you can make a delicious pie dough on your own. To make about one pie’s worth of dough, gather 2½ cups of all purpose flour, ¼ teaspoon salt, 3 tablespoons white sugar, ¼ cup vegetable shortening, 12 tablespoons cold, cubed butter, and ¼ cup of ice water.Use a food processor to pulse the flour, salt, and sugar until mixed. Add the shortening and butter incrementally, until the mixture is crumbly. With the processor running, add the ice water one tablespoon at a time until a firm, consistent dough is produced.
Press the dough into a ball or hockey puck shape. If you’re preparing the dough ahead of time, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate.
 Though you don’t need eggs in the dough recipe, have a few on hand to assist in baking. You’ll want to beat the eggs and brush them onto your pie crust letters to seal any small separations and hold them together as they bake.Note that you’ll also need parchment paper and a pastry brush.
Beat an egg yolk into a teaspoon of water for the perfect beaten egg equivalent.

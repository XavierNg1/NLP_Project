 It appears on your map as a gun icon. The alley in which this event takes place is directly east of the Ammu-Nation.If this event is available and has been triggered, your minimap will flash. A blue dot will also appear on your minimap, which signifies that someone nearby needs your help.


Unequip any weapons before approaching the woman. She will not ask for your help if you have a weapon equipped.;
, Keep your distance from her as she leads you into the alley. A man will appear from behind the corner of the building, and the two of them will draw their pistols and start shooting at you.


If you donâ€™t keep your distance from the attackers, they will steal $500 from you. It is still possible to retrieve the money they stole after killing them, however.If one of them steals from you, they will stop attacking you and take off running. If you do not shoot and kill them before they run away out-of-sight, you will not be able to retrieve your stolen money.
 It is best to use a gun with good range, such as a submachine gun. Using a close-range weapon, such as a sawed-off shotgun, may require you to stand too close to the attackers and risk being robbed. Once you successfully kill both attackers, the random event will be complete and you can walk up to them to retrieve their dropped ammo and the money they may have stolen.


You have the option to flee from them instead. Doing so will complete the event, but you lose out on the ammo they drop.
If you do decide to flee instead, wait for the second attacker to appear before you run away. They will not pursue you once you leave the alley.

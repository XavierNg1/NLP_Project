 Tanning beds use ultraviolet (UV) light bulbs emitting UV radiation similar to that of the sun.However, these beds are known to heighten your chances of getting skin cancer. Therefore, dermatologists highly advise against using them. But, if you need to get an immediate tan, this is the quickest, most effective method out there.
 It is extremely important that you wear goggles specially formulated for tanning beds while tanning. You can buy or rent these at the tanning salon.
 Tyrosine is an amino acid that your body uses to produce melanin, a chemical that makes your skin darker. However, the FDA does not approve tyrosine and there is no concrete evidence that it actually works.
 If this is your first time tanning, you should start with a relatively small amount of time around eight minutes. People generally tan in beds for between eight and 20 minutes, though the median rests around 12 minutes. If you have very fair skin, go for a shorter period of time than if you have darker skin and/or a good base tan.


Undress completely and get in the tanning bed. Shut the top flap over you like a clam shell. Find the button to flip on the tanning lights.
The lights are programmed with a timer and will shut off automatically when your time is up. Be sure to get into the bed right away when the timer begins.

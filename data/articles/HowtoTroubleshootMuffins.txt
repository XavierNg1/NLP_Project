 If the muffins had peaks like Everest with too much color, this is known as "peaked". It usually means that the muffins have been baked in an oven that is too hot, or the muffin mixture was over-mixed.;
, This usually means that the muffin cavities in the pan were overfilled. Don't fill the holes more than two-thirds full.
 An undercooked muffin will have a center that is too moist and it doesn't peak enough. Usually this is caused by the oven not being hot enough or the cooking time was too short.
 Poorly risen muffins with a heavy, dense texture usually means that the raising agent was insufficient or ineffective (stale) or that the muffins were missing an ingredient or two. If you've made substitutions to the muffin, this may also be another reason for poor rising.
 Usually this means that either the oven temperature was too high or you left them in for too long. Use a timer if you're forgetful.
 When a muffin has baked properly, it will have an even texture and will have risen evenly in the centre. Overall the colour will appear golden. When looked at in the pan, the muffins will be starting to come away from the sides of the pan holes of their own accord.

 Take your can or bucket and fill it 3/4ths of the way full with warm tap water. There is no need to use filtered water and heat it in the microwave. Get your faucet’s water to be above room temperature, but not scalding hot (about 85 degrees Fahrenheit).


Place the thermometer into the aluminum can.
 Use any glass or cup around you and fill it with ice. You don’t want to add ice directly to the warm water. Add some regular tap water to create ice water. It is better for the experiment to add ice water instead of full ice cubes.
 Bring all your supplies to the location where you plan to conduct the experiment. Have a friend assist you to bring the supplies to the location you decided on. Be careful not to spill any of the liquids or break the thermometer.
 When conducting scientific experiments and measurements, it’s best to record the starting temperature. Look at the thermometer in the cup and jot down the starting temperature and time.The temperature should be around 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
 Use a small spoon or syringe to add the ice water to the cup to effectively lower the can's surface temperature. Avoid adding pieces of ice to the can. To get the most accurate reading, you’ll need to transfer the ice water slowly. As you add the ice water, stir the mixture gently.


Keep your eye on the surface of the aluminum cup., Keep adding ice water to the warm cup until you notice dew or perspiration on the side of the can. This is the moment you’ve been waiting for. Once dew has formed on the outside of the cup, the liquid in the cup has reached the dew point., Right when you notice dew on the outside of the cup, record the temperature into your notes. You should also record the outside temperature or the temperature of wherever you are conducting the experiment.


It is also a good idea to record the time to determine how how long it took to form dew.

 Do they look healthy? Are they happily playing? Don't pick a mouse that looks sick or weak. You want to get a healthy, happy, and strong mouse.


A healthy mouse should have a clean, well groomed coat and bright, healthy eyes.
A healthy mouse should be moving freely and be inquisitive.
An unhealthy mouse may have a poor coat condition, dull eyes and its posture may be hunched up.;
, Is the smell overwhelming? Or is it just a little stink? A strong-smelling cage could mean they are living in unsanitary conditions. A dirty cage means a dirty mouse, possibly even a sick one.
 Ask your breeder or rescue about the mice. Where did they come from, have they ever been sick, are the genders separated, are they handled often, etc.
 If you don't like the mice there you can always go to another breeder or rescue. Do not go to a pet shop unless you have exhausted other options, as they are less likely to be healthy, good tempered, or long-lived, and you may even come away with a pregnant mouse. Breeders and rescues also offer backup and advice for your mice and should always be prepared to take your mice back if for any reason you are no longer able to keep them.
 When you find the mice you want, buy or adopt them. But be careful. Don't shake your carrier. You could injure the mice.

 Don’t wait until the day you need to be somewhere. Taking extra time to familiarize yourself with what to expect will ensure your trip is smooth and stress-free as possible.


Research the station and its location to you. You may need to take a bus or ride your bike there. Find out how long it will take you to arrive to your destination. Determine the price of your fare and if you’ll need to transfer.
 The turnstiles where you buy your ticket will be readily apparent. They accept cash, but cards are generally easier to deal with.


Look for the turnstile or gate where you can buy your fare. Never get on a train without paying the fare––getting caught is incredibly expensive and can go on your record.
 Passes are oftentimes cheaper than buying a ticket every day.


Do the math by multiplying each day you use the train by the cost of the ticket. Compare that number to the price of a week or month long pass.
 If you’re not sure where the boarding area is, look at a map or follow the signs.


Once you arrive at your platform, wait a safe distance from the tracks. Pay attention to where you are walking and where the train will arrive. Keep your head up and stay alert.
When the train arrives, allow other passengers to disembark before you get on. Don’t stand in front of the door and expect them to walk around you; stand to the side and give them proper room to leave the train.
 Get all the way on; don’t let any part of you (including the straps of your bag) dangle outside of the doors.


Make sure you are on the correct train by listening to the destination and route. If you’re not, get off at the next stop and reevaluate.
 Bring a book, download music, or play games on your phone.


Always be respectful of the people around you by using headphones and keeping your music or radio show to a respectable level.
Be polite and courteous to your neighbors. Offer older people or otherwise infirm people your seat.

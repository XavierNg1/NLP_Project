 Place packaged or homemade seasoned breadcrumbs in a large bowl or container within reach of the area where you will be cutting. Note that breading your wings is optional and is used based on preference and persuasion. If you do not care for breaded hot wings, or you are a loyal "buffalo" wing fan, disregard this steps concerning breading your wings.
 As you cut your wings, set the usable pieces into the breading container. Toss or stir the wings until each one is completely coated with breading. Place a cover on the container. Chill for 1 - 2 hours.
 Preheat your fryer or stock pot filled with vegetable oil. Place the wing pieces in slowly and carefully. The hot oil can splash up and burn you if you are not careful. Do not put too many in the pot at one time. Cook until the pieces are lightly browned.
 Remove the wings from the oil and place them on a plate lined with a few layers of paper towel. The paper towel will absorb excess oil from the chicken.
 First, transfer the wings to a large bowl. Cover with wing sauce. Stir the wings to evenly coat. The sauce can be pre-bottled favorite from the grocery store, or you can make your own sorry we can not provide you with the information on making your own wing sauce.
 Accompany the wings with celery sticks and a dish of bleu cheese dipping sauce or dressing. These side items will tame the tongue after its been introduced to a particularly spicy sauce.

, No one likes feeling sweaty and smelly!

, You always want to have some emergency money handy, but no more than that! It's a bad idea to keep large sums of cash with you, particularly if you don't usually lock your locker.
 You probably don't want to walk around with really smelly breath.
 To keep your lips in "kissable mode." (Vaseline can double as a lotion and a cut/scrape protector.)

, This will help if your hands are dry, or once again, for those ashy moments.
 You'll probably know yourself why and/or if you need to change them.
 To keep your hair nice. If your hair is long enough, a comb for tangles.
 In case you actually use it.
 Some girls like the smell, and some girls don't. Don't wear it after gym it will stink when mixed with sweat but some schools have rules against wear cologne because some people are allergic to it. Do not put a lot on though, because there are many people that highly despise the smell of axe.
 If you wear glasses, a clean cloth.


Whatever else you want.

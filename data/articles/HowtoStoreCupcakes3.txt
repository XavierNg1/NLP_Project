 Wrap unfrosted cupcakes in plastic wrap or aluminum foil.


You can store unfrosted cupcakes in airtight containers, if desired, but the plastic wrap will make it easier for the cake to retain moisture. This is important since the process of refrigeration tends to draw moisture out of food.
 Arrange frosted cupcakes in airtight containers. Choose containers that are tall enough to accommodate the height of the frosting.


Leave enough space in between the cupcakes for you to comfortably reach in and grab them.
If the frosting reaches above the height of the container, cover the container with aluminum foil instead of the lid. Tent the foil so that it clears the height of the frosting.
 Place the cupcakes in your refrigerator and store them for two to seven days.


Unfrosted cupcakes should be able to last for seven days inside the refrigerator.
Most frosted cupcakes last for two to four days in the refrigerator. Those decorated with whipped cream or fresh fruit are best when eaten within two days, though., Roughly 20 minutes before you plan to serve the cupcakes, bring them out of the refrigerator and let them drop down to room temperature.


This isn't strictly necessary since you can eat a chilled cupcake, but the texture of the frosting might seem unnaturally stiff if you eat it directly out of the refrigerator.

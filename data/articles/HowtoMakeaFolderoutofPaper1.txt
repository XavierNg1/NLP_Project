 This method calls for two pieces of 11”x17” construction paper. If you have larger sheets, you can simply cut them down to size., Take the first sheet of construction paper and fold it in half lengthwise.With the sheet folded, you will have a sheet that is roughly 5.5”x17” in size.
 Now take the second sheet of construction paper and place it inside the fold of the first sheet.You want to align the 17” edges when placing the second sheet.


Make sure that the bottom edge of the second sheet rests snugly into the crease you made in step 1.
 With the two sheets placed together, you now want to fold both pieces widthwise.This means you want to fold a crease along the 11” side of the whole sheet, which is the 5.5” side of the previously folded sheet.


Once you fold, the large sheet will be roughly 8.5”x11” in size, and the smaller sheet will form a small set of pockets around the bottom of it.
 After you have folded the papers in half, the center crease will make the spine of the folder, and the first sheet that you folded in step 1 will form pockets. In order to hold the pieces together, you simply need to staple the pocket piece to the larger folder piece at the edges of the cover.You can also place a staple along the bottom of each cover of the folder to reinforce the bottom of each pocket.
This folder will actually have four usable pockets—two on the inside of the folder and one on the outside of each cover.

 Depending on your injury, you may need continued treatment until the problem totally resolves or ongoing if the problem becomes chronic. This sometimes involves physical therapy, chiropractic care or alternative treatments. There are various treatment regimens for chronic injuries. These include:


Spinal manipulation: Manipulating or moving certain joints and muscles by a trained professional can help in pain reduction.
Ultrasound: Deep heat is produced by high frequency sound waves.
Strengthening exercises: making the areas around an injury stronger can sometimes help ease stress off of the injury.
Massage therapy: Manual rubbing can soothe and relieve pain.
Water therapy: Monitored exercise in water can help in strengthening.
Electrostimulation: A mild electrical current provides pain relief by preventing nerves from sending pain signals to the brain.

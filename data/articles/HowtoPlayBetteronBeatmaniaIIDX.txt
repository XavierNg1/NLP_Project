 Class Mode is designed to help you to improve your coordination between eyes and fingers and adapting changes of BPMs by giving you 4 songs per class, each with gradually increasing difficulty, while Story Mode (or Step Up Mode on IIDX Lincle) can help you build your "stamina".;
, Modifiers that change scrolling speed such as HI-SPEED will help you to see notes better. Changing the scrolling speed means that the space between notes is larger, but this also means that the time for you to react is much more shorter, so watch out. Also, HARD or EX-HARD is very helpful. HARD or EX-HARD make the gauge increase more difficult and decrease at more rate than normal. This way, you can push yourself to the limit and slowly but sure, you will do better.
 Don't play same songs repeatedly. There are a lot of songs with interesting pattern, so you can learn new techniques.
 You cannot push yourself too much. It is better that you start playing on difficulty range(s) that are comfortable for you, then increase the difficulty step-by-step.
 This is a way to sharpen your skill on recognizing the BPM and how the beat will be. By recognizing the BPM you will learn to play in time with the beat and you will receive a much better judgement.
 Playing versus with other partner can raise the competitive side of yourself and encourage yourself to push yourself to the limit. But, find partners that is as good as you or better than you.
 Yeah, the effect is similar to the one above.

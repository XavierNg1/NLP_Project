 Look for a spot away from popular paths, and where the ground is easy to dig into but not mushy. You don't want anyone to have to come across your waste! You should also be at least 200 feet from any water source to avoid contamination.
 When camping, its important to have a shovel dedicated do doing just this. You should dig your hole by a tree for cover and so that you have something to hold onto. Make sure that it is at least 6 inches deep!, Hold onto the tree with both hands, lean back and make sure that you are over the hole. Then do what you need to do!, Toilet paper is trash, and should not be left in nature!, Cover your hole up using leaves and dirt and make sure that nobody will accidentally step in anything you've left behind. You may want to leave a stick or other kind of marking to make sure that nobody else digs a hole in the same spot and finds an unpleasant surprise!

 Make sure your computer is near a wall cable socket.;
,, Most modem's don't have an On/Off switch. Plugging and unplugging them is how you turn them on and off.


When the cable modem is turned on, it has to go through a boot up process. You can tell this process is done when most of the lights have turned on and stopped blinking. There's usually one light that will keep blinking.
It usually takes about 30-60 seconds for a modem to finish turning on.
If you've purchased a new modem, you'll need to call your cable ISP and give them information about your new modem, because they won't recognize it as being associated with your account otherwise. You'll need your modem's serial number and its MAC address, both of which should be printed on the bottom or side of the modem., Open a web browser and go to a website that you haven't been to before. If you go to a website you've been to recently, your browser may load it from its cache. If the website loaded, then you're connected to the internet. If not, complete the rest of the steps.


Searching for something using a search engine is a good way to do this.

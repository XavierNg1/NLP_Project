 In order to download a version of Siri that works with older devices, your iPhone will need to be jailbroken first. This will allow you to access Cydia, which can install apps not allowed on the official App Store.


Your device must be running iOS 5.1.1 or later.
This method has been known to cause issues on older devices. If your device loses functionality, you may need to restore it.
 You will need to add the SiriPort repository before you can download it. Go to Manage > Sources > Edit > Add. Then, type "http://repo.siriport.ru" into the box that appears. Tap "Add Source".
 When it does, search for the "Siriport (original) iOS 6" package. Install it and reboot your iPhone.
 Scroll down until you find the entry for SiriPort.ru. Select this, and then tap "Install Certificate". This will open a Safari window displaying the Install Profile screen.


Tap Install, and then tap Install again in the upper-right corner. On the Profile Installed page, you should see the word Trusted in green letters. Tap Done and then close the Safari window.
 There may be a delay when using this method, because the program has to communicate with servers overseas.

 Homemade toothpaste can be adapted to your specific needs and tastes, but ensure you are including the following types of ingredients:


A cleaning substance.
An abrasive to loosen plaque.
An emulsifier to help the various ingredients mix well.
A sweetening agent to make the toothpaste palatable.
A flavoring agent (optional, but helpful both for taste and freshening your breath).;
, Start with a proven method and experiment from there to determine your tastes and preferences. One common recipe includes the following ingredients:


1/2 teaspoon glycerin (a sweetener)
1/8 teaspoon mild neutral soap powder (a cleanser)
1 tablespoon calcium carbonate, which is often sold as chalk of Paris White (an abrasive)
1/2 teaspoon gum arabic, commonly sold at health food stores (an emulsifier)
A couple drops of peppermint oil (a flavoring agent)
1/8 cup water

, Combine all ingredients, then heat and stir for five minutes over medium heat, or until your mixture has achieved a paste-like appearance. You can make a year's supply of homemade toothpaste for one-tenth the price of purchasing a market brand.Experiment with different flavorings. Making your own toothpaste can be an especially useful solution if you harbor a strong dislike of the mint flavoring used in most commercial toothpastes.
As your homemade toothpaste doesn't have all the ingredients found in commercial toothpaste (for better and for worse), consider alternating between your homemade toothpaste and a commercial toothpaste every two weeks.
When using a homemade toothpaste, consider following with a mouthwash.

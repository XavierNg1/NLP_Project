 While you can't control your genetics, you can use the power of illusion to make your hair appear thicker. Ask your hairdresser for the best cut and style to create thickness and volume in your hair.


Add layers to create fullness, especially if your hair is very straight.
If you are feeling daring, consider getting bangs. The contrast between your bangs and the rest of your hair will help accentuate length.
Get a trim. When hair tapers off at the ends, it tends to appear thin and unhealthy. Trimming your hair so that it’s an even length will make hair appear healthier and more bouncy, and get rid of split ends in the process. Keep your hair looking salon-ready by getting it trimmed every 6-8 weeks.
 Highlights add dimension to hair, making it appear fuller. As mentioned above, however, bleaching hair extensively can cause further breakage, so stay within your natural color range.
 If you’re not ready to take the plunge and splurge on full extensions, try clip-ons. These are a much cheaper (albeit less realistic looking) version of hair extensions that can be purchased at local beauty supply stores. Find some in a color and texture similar to your own, and clip them in on a daily basis to add volume to your hair.

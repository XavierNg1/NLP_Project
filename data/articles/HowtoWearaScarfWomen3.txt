 Use a long rectangle scarf in any fabric.


Fold the scarf in half lengthwise.
Place the center of the scarf behind your neck, with the ends falling on either side of your chest and waist.
Smooth the scarf down your sides.
Loop a small accessory belt around your clothing and the scarf. Secure the scarf in place with the belt.
Alternatively, you can throw the folded scarf over your shoulder. Use a belt to secure the scarf down your right side in back and in front.
 Make sure the scarf is thin and wider than the circumference of your waist by 6 inches (15cm).


Fold the scarf in half diagonally.
Roll the scarf together until the ends are wrapped up.
Thread the scarf through your belt loops. Tie it in front or off to the side.
 Grab a very large square scarf or a sarong.


Wrap the opposite sides around your waist.
Place both ends on 1 side of your hips.
Tie them tight until the skirt hangs at your hips. Tie a double knot to secure it.

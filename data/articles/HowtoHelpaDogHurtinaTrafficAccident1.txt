 Start talking to the dog before moving toward it. Use a soft, soothing voice that will be comforting to the dog. Shouting or using a loud, firm voice could intimidate the dog, making it uncomfortable or scared.


Keep talking to the dog in this manner the whole time you are trying to help it.;
, As you approach, keep your body turned slightly away from the dog so that you are not towering over it. Towering above the dog can be scary for it and may cause it to act aggressively in defense.If possible, stay low to the ground as you approach so that you appear as less of a threat to the dog.
 Do not run up to the dog, as this might frighten it and cause it to try to run away. Instead, make slow, steady movements. Stop when you are about one foot away from the injured dog., Make a loose fist with one of your hands. Keeping your knuckles pointed up, slowly extend your closed hand toward the dog. Depending on the dog’s reaction to your hand, do one of the following:


If the dog struggles, growls, or makes another act of aggression, retract your hand. Continue to talk softly to the dog for another minute or so, then reach your hand out again. You may need to do this several times before the dog begins to trust you.
If the dog shows no signs of aggression, pet it gently with your closed hand. Continue talking softly to the dog while you pet it., If you’ve tried to approach the dog by following the steps above, but the dog is still being very aggressive, it may not be safe for you to try and help the dog. If you feel the dog will bite you if you continue to approach, slowly back away. Call animal control to assist in rescuing the dog.


You should also call animal control if the dog has run away from the scene. They can help track down and safely capture the dog.

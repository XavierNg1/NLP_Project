 At first, don't try to be brave or strong for anyone- allow yourself to let it all out. This may mean not leaving your bedroom for an afternoon or taking a long walk by yourself. Get your privacy and give yourself time to unload all your feelings.
 Don't stay camped out on that couch forever- there is a limit to sobbing and obsessing. Once you've allowed yourself enough time to unwind, get up and take action.

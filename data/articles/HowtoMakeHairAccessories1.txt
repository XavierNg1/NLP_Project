 Choose a ribbon or trim of your choice, and pick up a thin elastic band in a color








If your headband is too loose, cut off more ribbon and sew it to the end of the elastic. The elastic will typically be hidden under your hair, so it won't be a problem to have a bit more of the stretchy material.
Avoid ribbon or trim with sequins sewn in, as they may get caught in your hair and cause a difficult tangle.;
, Hard-shell headbands are available for incredibly cheap, at several for a dollar at many stores. They're cheap for a reason though: they're plain. Grab a couple in a color you like, and decorate away! Wrap them in ribbon, spray-paint them, glue on beads or sequins, or add feathers. The sky's the limit when it comes to decorating these bad boys. Plus, because they're cheap you don't have to worry about ruining one and not being able to make a new one. 








Use found items or pieces off of old headbands or jewelry in order to be environmentally friendly and frugal.
 This is a great option for combining fashion with utility. Purchase two 2" thick jersey headbands from any beauty supply store. Cut one of the headbands in half along the seam. Place the cut headband through the complete headband, and then sew the ends back together (so you are left with two loops linked together). Pull the loops tight and then sew the opposite ends of the loops together to create a single loop, with a knot at the front where the two headbands meet.








If you'd rather not buy and butcher two perfectly good headbands, any jersey fabric cut into strips will work. You can also choose to use old nylons for the same effect.
You can hand-sew or use a sewing machine for this project.

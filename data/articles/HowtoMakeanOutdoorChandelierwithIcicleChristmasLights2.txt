 Spread newspaper or cover the surface before you paint to protect your floor or room. Also, paint in a well ventilated area to avoid being exposed to hazardous fumes.


Allow up to 48 hours for dry time depending on the number of coats you used and humidity levels. You don't want to start the project with a wet hula hoop.
Spray paint the plastic pole tubing the same color and allow ample time for the tubing to dry.
 Tuck any excess wire underneath and tape with the duct tape. You want a seamless, continuous strand to wind around the hoop.
 Essentially you are determining placement before you tape the icicles in place. Make sure the entire hoop is covered and icicles are draping downward off the hoop.
 Wind tape around in a circular motion, covering the wire but not the lights. Smooth any bubbles or bumps along the way.
 You should essentially be creating a pyramid with the tube.


Use duct tape to join the tube to the hoop and the three tubes together at the top.
Optionally you can tie the twine forming a cross and hang it up on a hook.
 Use the extension cord to plug into an outlet. Do the same if you're going to the twine.

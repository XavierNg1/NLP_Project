 Buy a suede brush, and use this to remove general dirt and debris with gentle brushing in a consistent direction — that is, don’t rub back-and-forth or in circles. However, for scuff marks, brush more vigorously and back-and-forth with the brush, then gently in one direction. Rubbing a suede eraser or even a regular pencil eraser on a stubborn scuff mark can also help.If you must use water to clean a stubborn stain (or need to remove a water stain), wet the entire shoe lightly and then blot it dry thoroughly. When the shoe is dry, use the suede brush to restore the texture.
Apply a spray-on suede protector after cleaning and on a regular schedule, as per the product directions.
 Most leather dress shoes are made of treated leather, but you may have a nice pair of untreated leather shoes or boots that need cleaning. Check the tag on the shoes to determine if the leather is treated or untreated. For either type of leather, use a soft brush or cloth to gently wipe away dirt and debris.


To give untreated leather a deeper clean, use saddle soap. Moisten a clean cloth, then rub a small amount of the soap onto it. Gently rub it onto the shoes, then wipe away the lather. Let the shoes dry thoroughly.
Protect untreated leather with mink oil. Apply a small amount using a clean cloth, then buff it with another clean cloth.
 Satin shoes are a common accompaniment to women’s formal wear (like a prom or wedding dress), since they can be dyed to match the dress color. A deep cleaning isn’t really possible with these delicate shoes, but you can remove minor debris and scuffing.


Wipe the shoes with a dry cloth.
Mix a small amount of oil-based soap with water, dampen a clean cloth with the mixture, and rub it gently over the entire shoe. Scrub a bit harder (in a circular motion) for more stubborn stains or scuffs.
Allow the shoes to dry overnight or longer before wearing them.
Re-dyeing the shoes may also help with stains or fading.

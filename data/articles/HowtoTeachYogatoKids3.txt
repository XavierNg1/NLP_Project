 The Archer Pose is a good one because kids can pretend they are shooting a bow and arrow.


Stand with feet wide apart with your heels on the floor and the left foot pointing left while the right foot points straight ahead. Extend your left arm and position your right arm so you pretend to be pulling back a bow.
Breathe and reverse the posture to the right side.
 This will stretch a child's entire body and help with breathing.
 Hold it at the knee, and then switch and do the other leg.
 Have kids get on their knees and lean forward, with their arms stretched out over their heads and their foreheads touching the floor.
, Kids will love pretending to be a snake. Lift the upper body off the floor while your legs and feet remain on the ground.

 If you don't know your both your cockatiels' ages, you need to figure this information out before breeding. A vet can help determine the rough age of your cockatiel. If possible, ask for your birds' birth dates from the breeder or pet store where you purchased them. If your cockatiels are not at least 15 to 24 months old, breeding is risky. Younger birds encounter more problems when breeding and fertilization is generally less successful., You should never simply breed two cockatiels without veterinary approval. You should have your birds thoroughly examined by a vet before beginning the breeding process. You want to make sure they're physically capable of breeding successfully.


Make an appointment with an avian vet. Explain to him or her you're thinking of breeding your cockatiels and you want to make sure this is safe.Your vet may want to do some blood tests in addition to a physical exam. Females with low blood calcium levels should not breed until levels can be raised., It can be difficult to determine a cockatiels gender through a physical examination. There are some behavioral and physical characteristics that may offer hints. Males are louder, for example, and females have more markings under their wings. However, the only way to tell for sure is a DNA test. If you don't know the gender of your cockatiels, have your vet conduct a DNA test to determine this. DNA can be gathered from blood or feathers., As the chance of genetic disorders increases with inbreeding, you should not breed your cockatiels if they are related. Return to the breeder or pet store where you purchased your cockatiels. Ask for a pedigree to make sure the birds do not share common ancestors. If you cannot obtain a pedigree, you may want to err on the side of caution and avoid breeding.

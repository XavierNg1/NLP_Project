 The pointed, bendable metal piece should squeeze through the eye and spring back into shape on the other side, providing a larger hole through which to insert the thread.
 Hold the tip of the thread to the threader and put it through the hole. Grasp the end of the thread and pull it through the threader so that you have a few inches of tail hanging through the threader.
 Slowly back the threader out of the eye. As it exits the eye it will pull the thread through, too. Take the threader off of the end of the thread. Your needle should now be threaded.
 Hold the the longer end of the thread perpendicular to the needle. Wind the thread around the needle twice. For a thicker knot, wind it around three times.
 Carefully pull the wound thread loops down the needle to the eye, then continue pulling the loops down the entire length of the thread.
 When you've reached the end of the thread with the thread loop, tighten it into a knot.

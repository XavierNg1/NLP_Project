 Once you’ve determined that your cat has died, take your cat to the vet. The vet can provide comfort by confirming that the cat has died. They also might be able to tell you why the cat has died. If you have other cats, learning the cause of death can help you to prevent the spread of any contagious disease or conditions to them.
 Once you are sure your cat has died, you may choose to bury your cat. Think about where you would like to have the cat be buried. Do you want to keep it in the yard of your home? Or buried in another beautiful place that you love? Once you decide on a place, bring gloves, a shovel, and a container for your cat. Hold a little ceremony in honor of your beloved feline.


You also may want to bring stones or a headstone to mark the spot where you buried the cat.
 Burying the cat may not be practical for everyone. In that case, you can ask your vet to have it cremated for you. You can then place the ashes in an urn or container, or scatter them somewhere outside.
 Coping with the death of your cat can be very painful. Remember that grieving is normal and healthy, and that everyone grieves at their own pace. While grieving, don’t blame yourself for the loss of your cat. Remind yourself that your cat felt loved and had a good life. Lean on others for support when needed, and be aware of any signs of depression.

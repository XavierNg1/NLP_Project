, If there is any color on the flashlight beside black, mold some white over it.
 You can use pony bead tubes (small, tube-like strings for pony beads), or you can use old headphone wires. You can use whatever works here! Add three on each side, inserting them in the clay. They should go from the far mold to the one near the light.
 You know, those claws you use to pick up different things, whether it be your loving companion cube, a complicated blueprint GLaDOS has hidden in a co-op test chamber, or a core you are about to incinerate. You definitely need those to complete any portal gun! I used bobby pins for this part, but you can get creative and use anything. Insert them on the mold near the light, prior to where the wires are. Insert them deeply and have them secured on; make sure they are in there tight!

 You can add little Portal designs, like a companion cube, an Aperture logo, paint it or GLaDOS hanging from the side--do what you'd like! A few ideas would be:

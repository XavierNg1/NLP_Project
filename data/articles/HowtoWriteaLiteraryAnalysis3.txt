 This will be where you give evidence for your argument. A standard body has three paragraphs, though a longer essay might require more.


In answering questions posed, think about what evidence you have to make your assertion. How does it relate to the overall theme? Are you leaving anything out?
Perform a close reading and analyze multiple factors in your literary analysis. You might discuss a character's development -- how the individual changes from the beginning to the end of the work. You could focus on a character's fatal flaw and examine the person's mistakes.
Consider focusing on the setting and theme of the literary work you're analyzing. Emphasize the ways in which these elements contribute to the overall quality of the work.
A paper fails when the writer chooses to ignore elements that don't fit his or her thesis. Make sure your argument doesn't pick and choose which parts of the text to address and which parts to ignore.
Emphasize one major point per paragraph in this section. No need to rush all of your evidence into one idea.
 If your author writes heavily in symbolism and other literary devices, obscuring the true intent of their work, research his/her experiences. What was going on in the world or in his/her life? Does your argument fit these circumstances?


This should advance a specific point of view about the text. You could argue that a given story is the product of the culture and time period from which it sprang. To follow up, provide details about the historical aspects of the literary work within the text and outside of it.
Don't hesitate to use secondary sources (texts from other authors).

A book or article discussing the same text
A book or article discussing a theory related to the text
A book or article discussing the historical or social context of the text

 Wrapping an old hard headband in fabric is an easy way to repurpose it. You only need a piece of fabric and some glue to do this.


Measure the width of your hard headband, and then choose a piece of fabric that is twice as wide and equally as long. Cut the fabric into a rectangle with those measurements.
Wrap the fabric around the hard headband, and attach the fabric to the underside of the headband with some fabric glue. Tuck the ends of the fabric under as well to create smooth ends.
 There are many lovely shades of yarn and embroidery floss available. Find a few you like and use them to wrap a headband.









Coat the entire headband in a thin layer of glue.
Then, begin at the inside bottom end of one of the headband pieces, and wrap your yarn or string in tight rings around the headband.
Continue until the entire headband is covered, and then cut the excess.
Seal the ends with an extra dab of glue

, Choose a pretty brooch, fabric applique, or grouping of feathers and decide on the perfect location for them on your headband. Then, use hot glue to attach them.








Make sure to use caution when using hot glue! You can also use fabric glue if you prefer.

 If you have a long trip before reaching your destination, try to ship milk using the instructions in Method 1. To take milk along with you, though, follow this method.
 If you are going to pack breast milk for a trip, make sure it is fresh. Either pump it immediately before packing, or remove the correct amount from the freezer.
 You can either use bags made specifically for storing breast milk, or you can use glass or BPA-free plastic containers. If you use glass or plastic containers, wash them with warm, soapy water, then rinse well. Dry them, and then fill them with milk.
 Make sure the cooler is not damaged or broken, and check to see that the lid closes well. If the ice melts, the breast milk wonâ€™t be safe to drink.
 Spread regular ice over the bottom of a clean cooler. Do not use dry ice. When it melts, it emits poisonous carbon dioxide that you will be in contact with each time you open the cooler. Dry ice should be used for shipping only.
 Whether you use bags or containers, arrange them neatly over the ice. Pack it in such a way that you use the oldest milk first.
 Leave the cooler closed during your trip so that the ice does not melt. You should be able to count on the milk staying frozen for four to six hours.
 If the milk has thawed, you must use what you can immediately and get rid of the rest. If it is still frozen, you can put it in a freezer right away.

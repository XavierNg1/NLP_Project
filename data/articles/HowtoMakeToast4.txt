 The best, most even toasting that you can do on the skillet comes from a cast-iron skillet, with no butter or oil to grease it. Just put your bread into the pan dry and let the heat toast the bread.








Adding the butter before it's even toasted? Why not. You can fry your toast in a little butter or oil to crisp it up and give it a golden crust. This is sometimes called "Texas toast," and it's delicious.
 When your bread is in, simply heat the skillet and toast it in the pan. The first side will take a bit longer while the pan heats up, so it's a good idea to keep an eye on it so you don't burn the bread.
 Using tongs or a turner, flip your bread over when the underside is done and start toasting the other side. You might as well turn them regularly to make sure you're getting an even crunch on both sides of the bread.

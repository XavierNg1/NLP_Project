 Open a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. Remove 4 peppers from the can, and use a sharp knife to slice them open. Scrape out the seeds and discard them.Save the adobo sauce that’s left in the can. You’ll need some of it to mix into the sauce.
 Add the chipotle peppers to the slow cooker along with 16 ounces (473) of chicken broth, 1 32-oz (907 g) can of fire roasted tomatoes, 2 diced onions, 5 garlic cloves, 2 tablespoons (30 g) of adobo sauce from the can of peppers, 1 ½ tablespoons (11 ½ g) of cumin, 1 teaspoon (3 g) of chili powder, 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt, and a pinch of sugar. Stir all of the ingredients together so they’re well blended.This sauce is fairly spicy. If you want a milder version, add less chipotle peppers and adobo sauce to lessen the heat.
 When all of the ingredients are mixed in the slow cooker, turn it on and set it to low. Allow the sauce to cook for 6 to 8 hours.You can cook the sauce on high for 3 to 4 hours if you want it to be ready more quickly.
 Once the sauce has finished cooking, use a spoon to lift out the chipotle peppers. With an immersion blender, puree the sauce until it is smooth.If you don’t have an immersion blender, you can transfer the sauce to a countertop blender to puree it.
 You can use the enchilada sauce right away. However, if you want to store it for use later, pour it into a glass jar. Allow it to cool, and keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.You can also freeze the sauce if you aren’t going to use it in the immediate future. Allow it to cool, and then ladle it into freezer bags. Squeeze the excess air out, and lay the bags flat in the freezer for storage. Allow the sauce to thaw for 24 hours before warming up on the stove.

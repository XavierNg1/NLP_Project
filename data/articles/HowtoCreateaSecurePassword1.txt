 Don't use a word or phrase of special importance to youâ€”like a birthday or family member. That's the kind of information that can be discovered by someone doing a little digging.;
, This is an open invitation to your online accounts, and it's often exploited to accomplish online identity theft.
 It should be at least eight-to-10 characters long, and longer passwords are even more secure. Some sites or applications may limit the password length, however.
 The capital and lowercase letters should not be grouped together. Mixing them up makes the password more difficult to predict. This kind of strategy might lead to "JeCaMiJe_" in the first example or "HouseOnSpooner#1500" in the second example.
 Many password systems don't allow actual spaces, but it can be useful to insert one into the middle of a password with systems that do. Alternatively, an underscore "_" or two can serve a similar function.
 You can use similar base words to help you remember your passwords easily without making them too easy to crack. So "JeCaMiJe_" might be modified as "my kids JeCaMiJe," "HouseOnSpooner#1500" might become "1500*my first House On Snooper."

, Choose a location away from your computer (and from prying eyes), but make sure you can easily access it. If you forget your password, you can retrieve it without much trouble.


When writing your password down, consider coding it with an offset pattern to make your password more difficult for others to decipher. Thus ri7%Gi6_ll might be written as 2tk9&Ik8_nn (where the offset for the coding is indicated by the first character, in this case +2). This would mean that each subsequent coded character is two alphabetical letters or numbers greater than the actual password character.

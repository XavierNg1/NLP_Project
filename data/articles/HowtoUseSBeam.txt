 At this time, S Beam is only available on the Samsung Galaxy S3, the Samsung Galaxy S4, the Samsung Galaxy S5, and on most versions of the Galaxy Note.;
,,, At the same time, “NFC” will also be enabled. NFC stands for “Near Field Communication,” which is the type of technology used to transfer files using S Beam.
 You can only use S Beam to transfer files between two devices that have the S Beam feature enabled.
 For example, if you want to send a video, open the video on the sending device.
 In order to receive files via S Beam, the receiving device must be on the Home screen.
 Both devices will beep and vibrate to confirm that the S Beam feature is ready for use, and a “Tap to send” or “Touch to beam” dialog box will display on the sending device., After a few moments, the sending device will display a message instructing you to separate the devices.
 The file you selected will start “beaming” and transferring to the receiving device.
 The file you transferred will now be saved on the receiving device in its appropriate location. For example, if you beamed a photo from the Gallery on the sending device, that same photo will now display in the Gallery on the receiving device. In some cases, the receiving device may prompt the user to select their preferred storage location for the file., In some cases, disabling and re-enabling the feature can resolve problems with unresponsiveness.
 A soft reset can often help resolve any software problems with your device.
 In some cases, the background processes associated with third-party apps could be interfering with S Beam.
 A hard reset will restore your device back to the original factory settings, and may resolve any ongoing software problems.

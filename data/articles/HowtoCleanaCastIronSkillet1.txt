 If your skillet is still hot, this is the best time to clean it. If your skillet has a distinct "lip" so that it holds water, you can pour water directly onto the hot pan--something you should not do with other kinds of cookware. It will hiss and steam dramatically, but this is fine. Take care not to get too close to the hot steam lest you risk a burn. Rinse it out once to remove many of the large pieces of food. Then fill it again so that the water fills the cooked on area.The exact amount is not important, but;
, If your skillet still needs cleaning, or is cold, you can heat the pan up again. Carefully place the cast iron skillet back on the burner and heat the water up until it reaches a boiling point. Boil the water for several minutes to help dissolve food scraps.
 Do this while the water is still boiling, but only briefly. Too much contact with metal objects risks stripping the pan's seasoning., Return the cast iron skillet to the burner and turn the burner off.


Use caution when transporting the skillet back and forth between the range and the sink. Because cast iron is an excellent conductor of heat, the handle, as well as all other portions of the skillet, will be extremely hot. Use a cloth or oven mitts to transport the skillet.
 If done correctly, the bottom of your paper towel should contain a dark layer of residue.
 Vegetable sprays work especially well for this purpose. Apply or spray a dab of fat into the bottom of the pan; with a paper towel, wipe the fat into the bottom and the sides of the pan. This process should turn the pan's surface into a smooth, glossy finish.

 Click start, and type "gpedit.msc" into the search editor (without quotation marks).
 Navigate to Computer Configuration> Administrative Templates> Windows Components> AutoPlay Policies. Right click "Turn Off Autoplay" and click "Edit."

, Check the circle labeled "Enable." Below this, under "Options," you will find a drop-down menu titled "Turn off Autoplay on." Select either "All Drives" or "CD-ROM and removable media drives," depending on whether you want to disable Autoplay for everything, or just CD-ROMs and removable media drives.
 Press “Save” in the bottom right corner of the window when you're done. That’s it! Autoplay will now be disabled in whatever situations you selected.

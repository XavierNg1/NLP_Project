 Clothes are very important, and you must dress the part in order to be successful in this venture.
 Tutu-like skirts are a must. Slip-on Vans are very popular among scene kids, as well as most other Vans. (Warning: wearing Vans too much if you aren't a skater could result in you being called a poser.) You could also try some checkered or colorful shoelaces.
 Dark ones such as black and torn are good, but things like bright neon colors, leopard, zebra or checkered are good too.
 You have to have at least 3 of these. Anything with cute monsters, fun sayings or just cool stuff works. Don't buy just black. Scene is a mix of black and neon colors. Wear any pattern you want. Animal print, checkers, plaid, stripes - anything that describes your personality.
 Brand tees are a must. Colorful skinny jeans, tutus, jean skirts, and Vans and Converse are awesome. Wear cool leggings with bold colors or stripes. Leg warmers too.
 Or you could go with the plain bold colour like red. Some very scene designs are: Alice in Wonderland, stars, hearts, lightning, skulls, bats, Anything to do with bands or childish stuff like ice cream and lollipops.
 Pok√©mon, Power Rangers, Keroppi, and especially Hello Kitty are all big parts of scene style. Printed T-shirts with cartoon characters or cute pictures on them are a must.
,, The newest edition to the scene girls sunnies are the old fashioned "cop" style sunnies (Ray-Ban Aviators). Horn-rimmed glasses with no lenses are super-popular in the scene world, and they look super cute too.
 There are a number of ways you can wear them that will make you look like a mature young person.
 It's time to dig them out from under your bed. Don't wear too may though - you want people to see your arms.

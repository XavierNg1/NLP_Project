 Unless you are a bartender, you probably don't have a muddler lying around, but muddling the mint is an essential part of making a good mojito. If you don't have a muddler, you can improvise with a wooden spoon or even the end of a rolling pin.If you do have a muddler, make sure it is made of unfinished wood. Anything that has been varnished or lacquered will eventually wear down, and the finish will end up in your drinks.;
, You can add the sugar as well, as the rough texture can actually help the muddling process.Make sure the glass you are using isn't thin or delicate or it could break during the process.Make sure you remove the leaves from the stems, as these will also give the drink a bitter taste.Spearmint is the type of mint most often used in a mojito, but you can experiment with peppermint or pineapple mint for different flavors., You do not want to shred, crush, or mince the leaves, as this will release the chlorophyll contained in the veins of the leaf. Chlorophyll is very bitter and will make your virgin mojito taste quite unpleasant., The purpose of muddling is to release the fragrant and tasty oils in the leaves, and roughing them up a bit will allow them to seep out and infuse your drink.Muddling the leaves with sugar will allow the oils to seep into the sugar, adding more depth to the drink., This is better than chopping the mint, which would release the chlorophyll, and also leave little bits of mint floating around in your beverage. Getting a piece of mint caught in your throat might spoil the fun of drinking a mojito.

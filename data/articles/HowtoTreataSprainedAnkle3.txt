 If you jog, for instance, start with a leisurely walk to warm up your ankle joint before you start to pound the pavement. Wear a brace if you need to while you are exercising to stabilize your ankle joint. Also, if you're learning a new sport, be careful not to play at full intensity until you're fully conditioned for the activity.
 Because your ankle is weakened by the sprain, you could turn it again if you aren't cautious while you're walking on a rough surface.
 Some people find that high-top sneakers help to stabilize their ankles while they are exercising. No matter what your activity, wear shoes that fit well and are comfortable. Make sure that the soles aren't so slick that you risk falling, and avoid high heels for a while.
 A physical therapist can give you exercises that will strengthen your ankles and the surrounding muscles so that you are less likely to injure your ligaments again.

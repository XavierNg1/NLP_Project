 Tap or click the “Play” button on the screen after selecting the level on the map, and the level will load.
 During the game, all your boosters can be accessed from the top right corner. Each booster has its own button. Boosters vary per level, and the ones you see here are the only ones applicable for the level.
 If you’ve run out of a particular booster during the game, you can reload without exiting and leaving our game. Tap or click the plus icon on top of the booster you want to reload.
 The selected booster’s screen will appear. The price in Gold Bars will appear with it. Tap or click the “Buy” button. The corresponding amount of Gold Bars will be deducted from you, and the appropriate number of boosters will be added. You can now use the booster in the game. Note that Gold Bars may cost you money to buy.

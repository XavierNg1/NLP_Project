 The United States closely monitors who enters the country and for what reason. Although there are many reasons to validly enter the United States, there are also common violations of U.S. immigration laws:


Sham marriages. Some U.S. citizens accept money or other favors in order to marry someone. The person they marry then qualifies for a green card. This type of scheme is illegal. In some situations, the U.S. citizen may be innocent but have been tricked by a foreign national into the marriage.Illegal entry. Some people might walk across the border or sneak through a port of entry without permission. This is illegal entry and can be reported.
Overstaying a visa. Many people are in the country illegally by overstaying their visa. In other words, they had a legal reason to enter the country but they didnâ€™t leave when they were supposed to. Sometimes, students and people in the U.S. for business purposes overstay their visas. You can report this violation.
 If you want to report immigration violations, then you can contact the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit, which is part of ICE, at 1-866-347-2423.

 These are great to use on location when you know you’ll be taking flash shots. On-camera diffusers simply attach to your camera, covering the flash with some kind of material to soften the light. There are many different models and types, each providing a slightly different approach to diffusing the light.For example, some work by bouncing light off the ceiling and directing the rest straight toward the subject through the fabric.


Others reflect the flash off a panel in the on-camera diffuser before directing it through the fabric at the subject.;
, Softboxes, also called lightbanks, are rectangular enclosures that you place over the light source (usually your flash) to soften it. These versatile tools create diffused, directional light, such as the kind that would stream in through a window.Soft boxes come in many different sizes. In general, the larger the softbox, the softer and more diffused the light will be.Most softboxes work by using a reflective material lining that bounces the light through the sheer fabric.
If you use a softbox, make sure that it can handle the wattage of light you’re using. Using the wrong softbox can create a fire hazard.
 Similar to a softbox, an umbrella is attached to the light source. They are typically made of white cloth or a metallic silver material. Both types diffuse light effectively and are very affordable (some cost less than twelve dollars).To diffuse light by bouncing it, aim the light source at a silver or white umbrella, which should target the light away from the subject.
To diffuse the light through an umbrella, use one made from sheer material. Aim the light source toward the subject, placing the umbrella in front of the light source.

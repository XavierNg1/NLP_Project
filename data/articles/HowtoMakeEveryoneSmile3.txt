 It is great that you want to make others smile; it shows that you have a generous heart and care about other people. But at the end of the day, you can't force anyone to smile or be happy. Every person has to choose whether they want to be happy or not.In order to be happy, experts say people must make a conscious effort. This can be hard for people who have been dealt a rough hand in life (such as those who struggle with poverty or illness), but anyone can choose to be happy. Outside influences (like your lovely self) can only do so much to help someone improve their happiness, unless they are also making an effort to be happy.
 You could be the most likeable, generous, attractive, and intelligent person in the world and guess what? There would still be people who criticize you or dislike you. This reflects more on them and their negative attitudes than it does on you.


There are many reasons why it may be impossible to win someone over. Perhaps you remind them of someone from their past who hurt them. Or maybe they struggle with jealousy or a lack of self-confidence and seeing how happy you are only makes them more miserable. Some people even have abusive personalities and can't stand to see other people happy., So you've tried to make someone smile by doing random acts of kindness, being polite, smiling at them, offering compliments, and just generally being pleasant to be around… and they are still grumpy.


If you’ve done everything you can do to make someone smile, at the end of the day you should be proud. You went out of your way for someone else. You have done your best, and that's all you can do. Keep being your pleasant self, but know that you can't fix everyone else's problems for them.

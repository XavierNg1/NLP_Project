 Make a plan about when you will call, and how much time you will wait between calls.


Make no more than two calls on any given day, and then only if you’re trying to figure out when she might be available to talk.
Don’t make more than three calls in one week. Give her a chance to find time to get back to you.
Don’t call on consecutive days unless you’re trying her at a time that you think she’s available. Even in this instance, make calls on consecutive days only once during the week.
Wait for the next week before any follow up calls.
 After you have left an initial message, and made a follow up call or two, wait a couple of weeks before contacting her again., There may be any number of reasons why she hasn’t called back. Although it’s not carved in stone that she will never call back, it should be clear that she isn’t calling back at the moment. However, if you show her that you are the scary desperate guy that doesn’t know how to let things go, it’s pretty much guaranteed you will not hear from her ever., Don’t hold a grudge or indulge in negative self talk about yourself or her. Don’t demonize her, and don’t feel embarrassed about your interest in her. Life is long, timing is everything, and you never know where she might turn up one day. Meanwhile, get on with things.

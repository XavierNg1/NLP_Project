 Becoming a private tutor can be very rewarding, especially if you're an expert in an in-demand field. In-person tutoring is much more rewarding and effective than online tutoring, but online tutoring (through email or a chat room) can earn you a little extra money.
 If you go into business for yourself, open a PayPal account to make it easy for your clients to pay you in whatever way is most convenient. Being able to offer credit card acceptance could make the difference between getting a client or not.
 Ask them if they can tell students who need help currently about your services.
 Be careful when advertising on craigslist, however- you don't want to get caught up in a scam.
 Speak with your friends, parents, or siblings about your tutoring services, and offer them a discount if they tell their friends, or volunteer to tutor for a little while so that they can test you out and you can build a reputation.

 While there are some general traits you can look for when trying to determine the sex of a fish, the best way to determine sex is to read about the specific fish in question. When doing this:


Visit your local library. Your local library may have several books on specific fish and their physiology.
Consult books like the Encyclopedia of Fish Physiology, available online or at your local library., Workers at fish stores, veterinarians, or biologists may be able to provide you with insight on a specific fish’s sex. If you have difficulty determining the sex of a fish, you should seek help from a professional.


Visit a local fish store – the more fish they have the better – with a picture of the fish and ask store employees if they can help identify the sex of the fish. If the store carries the specifies of fish in question, they’ll likely be able to help you.
 There are a wide variety of videos on the internet or television about fish and how to determine their sex. Take some time to search the internet for videos that might be helpful. You may wind up learning a lot about fish physiology and reproduction.


Watch videos on YouTube.
Think about shows on Animal Planet or National Geographic.

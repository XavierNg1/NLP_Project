 Lightroom's export presets are essentially "shortcuts" for the saving process — they are sets of saving conditions that allow you to get through the export process quickly if you already know exactly what you want. To begin, select this option from the file menu — it's two options below the standard "Export" option.
 Your options should pop out in a submenu from the "Export with Preset" option. The different presets specify different conditions for saving your photos. See below for a brief selection of each.


You can also access these presets this by selecting "Export", then picking the preset from the menu on the left., This option will create JPEG photos at maximum quality with a resolution of 240 pixels per inch and no scaling.By default, the files will be saved to the "Files On CD/DVD" location that you have chosen at the top of the dialog box.
 The DNG ("Digital Negative") file format is a raw image data format created by Adobe. The format is compatible with most Adobe image processing programs and many non-Adobe programs.This preset creates photos in this file type with no post-processing at the location you specify.
 As their names suggest, the two "For Email" options save your photos with email-friendly sizes and formats. The differences between the two options are:



For Email: This option immediately launches an email message with the files attached so that you can send your photos directly from Lightroom.

For Email (Hard drive): Saves the files with email-friendly characteristics to your hard drive. No email is sent.
 In addition to the presets that come with Lightroom, it's possible to create your own to save time the next time you need to save your work. To do this, use the steps below:Select File >Export.
Choose the export settings you want for your new preset.
Click "Add" in the bottom left of the dialog box.
Give your new preset a name and click "Create." Your preset will now be available via the same steps as you used for the other presets.

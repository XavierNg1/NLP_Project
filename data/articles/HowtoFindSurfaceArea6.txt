 A square pyramid has a square base and four triangular sides. Remember, the area of square is the length of one side squared. The area of a triangle is 1/2sl (side of the triangle times the length or height of the triangle). Because there are four triangles, to find the total surface area, you must multiply by four. Adding all of these faces together yields the equation of surface area for a square pyramid: SA = s2 + 2sl.For this equation, s refers to the length of each side of the square base and l refers to the slant height of each triangular side.
The units of surface area will be some unit of length squared: in2, cm2, m2, etc.
 The slant height, l, is the height of one of the triangular sides. It is the distance between the base to the peak of the pyramid as measured along one flat side. The base side, s, is the length of one side of the square base. Because the base is square, this measurement is the same for all sides. Use a ruler to make each measurement.Example: l = 3 cm

Example: s = 1 cm


, The area of a square base can be calculated by squaring the length of one side, or multiplying s by itself.Example: s2 = s x s = 1 x 1 = 1 cm2


, The second part of the equation involves the surface area of the remaining four triangular sides. Using the formula 2ls, multiply s by l and two. Doing so will allow you to find the area of each side.Example: 2 x s x l = 2 x 1 x 3 = 6 cm2


, Add the total area of the sides to the area of the base to calculate the total surface area.Example: s2 + 2sl = 1 + 6 = 7 cm2

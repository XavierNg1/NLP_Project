 You can simply get a gift which has significance to both of you. Another option would be to follow the traditional gifts for specific anniversaries, such as silver, gold, etc. It is also possible to agree on a combined gift, such as a large purchase that you both want. A new television could be an example. If you want to go with the traditional gifts, here is the list:


5th: Wood
10th: Tin
15th: Crystal
20th: China
25th: Silver
30th: Pearl
40th: Ruby
50th: Gold
60th: Diamond.
 You can repeat your vows together over a candle-lit dinner, or you can throw a big ceremony. A ceremony would be particularly nice for couples who did not have money for a big wedding when they first married.
 Another popular way to spend a wedding anniversary is to sit down together and watch your wedding videos. This will let you laugh about the things that were so stressful and seemed so horrible at the time, while also serving to remind you of the feelings associated with that act of love. You can watch together or with other people.
 One popular way to celebrate your wedding anniversary is to have dinner at your wedding reception location. This will remind you of all of the happy memories of that night. Consider calling ahead and ask the cook staff about the possibility of recreating the meal eaten at your reception, if it isnâ€™t still on the menu.
 Cruises are popular ways to celebrate anniversaries. These remove the stress of traveling abroad and give you time to just enjoy each other's presence in a relaxing environment.

Manual Driver Search - Use the information from Step 1 to select the correct driver. The four most recent drivers will be shown.
Auto-Detect Your GPU - The Nvidia website will use a Java applet to detect your graphics card and display the correct drivers. You will need Java installed to run it. The current applet is out of date, which may cause problems with some browsers. You'll have an easier time using one of the other two methods in this step.
 Click the link to download the latest version of the driver. You should always download the latest version unless you specifically need an older one. The latest version will often give the best performance.
 Run the downloaded installer to update your drivers. The installer will automatically remove the old drivers and install the updated ones.


Most users can choose the "Express" option during installation.
Your screen may flicker or go black for a short time during installation.
 When the driver update is installed, a system restore point will be created automatically. This will allow you to roll your system back to before the driver was installed.

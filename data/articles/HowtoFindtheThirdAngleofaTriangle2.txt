 Sometimes, instead being lucky enough to know the measurements of two of the angles of a triangle, you'll only be given a few variables, or some variables and an angle measurement. Let's say you're working with this problem: Find the measurements of angle "x" of the triangle whose measurements are "x," "2x," and 24. First, just write it down.
 It's the same principle that you would follow if you did know the measurements of the two angles. Simply add up the measurements of the angles, combining the variables. So, x + 2x + 24° = 3x + 24°.
 Now, subtract these measurements from 180° to get closer to solving the problem. Make sure you set the equation equal to 0. Here's what it would look like:


180° - (3x + 24°) = 0
180° - 3x - 24° = 0
156° - 3x = 0

, Now, just put the variables on one side of the equation and the numbers on the other side. You'll get 156° = 3x. Now, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get x = 52°. This means that the measurement of the third angle of the triangle is 52°. The other angle, 2x, is 2 x 52°, or 104°.
 If you want to make sure that this is a valid triangle, just add up the three angle measurements to make sure that they add up to 180°. That's 52° + 104° + 24° = 180°. You're all done.

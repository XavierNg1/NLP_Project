 To avoid long wait times at the airport, schedule your flight for a low demand time, which might also save you money. Weekends are usually the busiest time for airports, so book a weekday flight if possible. Flights leaving between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. are likely to be the least populated, making for a smoother, quicker airport experience., Checking your luggage at the airport will mean waiting in an extra line, as well as waiting around a carousel to retrieve your luggage after your flight. It will also cost you extra with most airlines and maybe cause problems you donâ€™t need (e.g. the airline misplacing your luggage). Pack light and do your best to fit everything you need into your carry-on bags. , If you have the money to splurge, buy premium class plane tickets for your trip. With many airlines, buying first class or business seats means moving through security checks quickly and boarding earlier than other travellers. For instance, with American Airlines, Priority Access, business class and first class passengers are granted access to expedited security check lines as part of their perks.These perks are often also available to frequent flyers.

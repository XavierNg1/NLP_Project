 Solar energy is about turning sunlight into energy we can use to heat and cool our houses, run appliances and vehicles, etc. It has become more viable and more cost effective to use in recent years, although more development continues to try to improve on both the amount of energy captured and the amount stored. Solar energy can be divided into the following:


Solar PV: This is the traditional solar panels. PV stands for photo-voltaic.
Concentrated PV: This uses lenses or curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto PV cells. It is more efficient.
Concentrated solar thermal: This uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight into heating a substance such as salt or liquids.;
, Solar energy is great for hot water systems in the average home and for garden lighting, and other things. The downside is that it won't be so effective when the amount of sun is low, and it doesn't work at night unless you have a way to store it.
 They will be able to show you the latest possibilities that use solar power and give you the estimated costs for installing it in your home.


Even if you only use solar energy for a few things on your property, this is a benefit that will save you money and emit less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. You'll be doing your part to minimize such emissions.

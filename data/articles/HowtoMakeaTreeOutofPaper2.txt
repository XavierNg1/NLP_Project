 Unfold six sheets of newspaper. Tape them together lengthwise to create one long sheet of newspaper., Use a cardboard tube roll as a guide to roll the newspaper into a tube.
 Carefully pull the cardboard tube out of the middle of the newspaper roll. Don’t let the newspaper roll come undone while you do this.
 Hold the bottom of the newspaper tube in one hand, and use the other hand to cut the top of the newspaper.


Use scissors to make a cut from the top of the newspaper tube down to around the middle of the roll.
Turn the roll a quarter turn and make another identical cut.
Repeat this two more times until you have 4 equal strips.
 Gently bend each of the strips away from the center so you can see the inside of the roll. Don’t make a folded crease, just bend them a little.
 Now it’s time to play with your tree and make it grow!


Hold onto the base of the tube with one hand.
Pinch the innermost layer of newspaper with your fingers and gently pull upwards on the newspaper inside the roll.
The newspaper tree will start to grow taller as you pull the newspaper up. The cut strips will spread out like branches creating the look of a growing tree.

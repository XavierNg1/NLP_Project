Crashed Real Estate Prices.
Tax Write offs.
Future appreciation in price.
Lowest Interest rates in 50 years (see graph below).;
,, Banks normally loan fixed rate loan on primary residences that are owner occupied.
,, At the end of the 1950s and early 1960s homeowners were getting loans on their homes at less than 6 percent. In 2010 and 2011 rates fell below 5%, the lowest since the 1950s.
,,, Assess the increased / excess equity (what your house is worth - what you still owe) in your house yearly and use that excess equity to buy another as soon as you can scrape up a reasonable deposit (20% if you are conservative).

Once every 40 years there is a major housing bubble caused by cheap money that inflates Real Estate. This happened in the 1890s, 1930s, 1970s and 2010s. During this severe recession, the Government prints money and spend it on stimulus packages (McKinley, FDR, Nixon) causing an inflationary up-leg. The initial contraction in Construction and Jobs causes inflation to be under control the first half of the decade, but when the population increase absorbs the foreclosed homes, then the Banks start to aggressively loan money on homes as they rise in price the second half of the decade. The printing of 4.1 billion dollars of cash per day insures another inflationary up-leg and a good jump in Real Estate prices.
Currently in 2011 one million foreclosures are expected as the ALT-A and Option Adjustable rate loan packages adjust higher. This caused an average 3.9% drop in prices in 2010 and another 3.9% average drop in home prices is expected in 2011. After March 2012 the loan packages are 99% done resetting to higher payments and you can expect Real Estate to rise in price some.

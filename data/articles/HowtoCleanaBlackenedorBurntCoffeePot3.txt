 Pour one cup of baking soda into the pot and completely fill it with water. Turn on the coffee maker to heat both the water and baking soda in the pot to a rolling boil., Remove the coffee pot from the heat. Allow the mixture to settle and stand for about 10 minutes. After it’s cooled down a bit, use a soft cloth or non-abrasive scrubbing pads to gently scrub the pot.Be careful of the pot’s hot sides as you clean it.
 If there are stains left over even after the baking soda/water boil, take the pot and pour almost all of the mixture out of it. Add more baking soda to the pot to create a paste. Scrub the pot out with the paste. Wash it out thoroughly when the pot is stainless to prepare it for use.

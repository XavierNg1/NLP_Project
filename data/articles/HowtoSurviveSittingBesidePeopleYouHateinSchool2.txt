 If you can't make friends, you have to move on to more drastic measures. One way to deal with a person you dislike is to simply not deal with him. That is, if the person is openly hostile to you, don't respond to the hostility. Simply keep doing what you're doing.For instance, you can try concentrating on your own work or counting to ten in your head., People are often mean for reasons you'd understand. That is, sometimes people are mean to try to make themselves feel better because they feel bad about themselves. Maybe they don't have a very good home life, or maybe they don't do as well in school as they'd like. If you can figure out why a person is mean, you may be able to feel compassion towards the person instead of hatred., It's always good to be polite, even when you're dealing with a person you don't like. It's still important to say please and thank you or to pass a paper over when asked to do so. Don't be openly rude to the person. You don't have any reason to be mean, even if you don't like the person.Remember, even if you don't like the person, he has feelings, too. If you're mean, you might be the one who's doing the bullying. Being polite shows you're the bigger person.
 If you're doing something annoying, such as kicking a chair or tapping your pencil, you may not even realize you're doing it. That's fine. Everyone has nervous or fidgety habits from time to time. However, if the kid next to you asks you to stop, go ahead and stop. Don't try to keep going just to annoy him. It will only make it worse., Some teachers will not agree to this suggestion. However, if you tell him or her that sitting next to that person distracts you, some teachers might agree to move you. Remember to be as polite as possible and to accept whatever decision your teacher gives you.
 Remember, you're at school to learn first. Friendships and classmates come second. Stay focused on what you're studying, not on what the person next to you is doing.

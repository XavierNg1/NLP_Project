 Wall slides help improve the bend of your knee.Lay on your back in front of a wall. Position your bottom about a foot (12 inches/30.5 cm) from the wall. You can place a towel or a pillow beneath your head. Place your feet flat on the wall as high as you can with your knees slightly bent. Slide your foot down the wall as far as you can, or until you feel a stretch in the front of your thigh. Hold the position for 10 seconds. Then place your other leg underneath the bent leg. Use this leg to push your affected leg back to the starting position.Repeat this stretch two to three more times, bending your knee a little further each time. Take a break in between stretches.
 Sit on the floor with your back against the wall. Place your legs flat on the floor in front of you. Slowly slide the heel of the affected knee toward your buttock. Slide your heel as close to your buttock as possible, or until you feel a stretch in the front of your thigh. Hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds.Repeat this stretch two to three more times, bending your knee a little further each time. Take a break in between stretches.

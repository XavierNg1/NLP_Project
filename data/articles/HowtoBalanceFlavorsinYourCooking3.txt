 A bitter dish can be adjusted with salt. If you added too many bitter ingredients, like bitter vegetables or alcohol-based seasoning, sprinkle some salt over the dish. Add enough salt that the dish loses its bitter flavor., If you ended with an overly sweet flavor profile, add bitter or sour ingredients to balance this out. A small splash of something like, say, lemon juice can balance out a sweet dish.Remember, bitter ingredients include things like coffee, beer, and green vegetables. Sour foods include things like yogurt, sour cream, and vinegars.
 Sour ingredients should be used in small amounts, as they can easily overwhelm a dish. A small squeeze of juice from a lemon, for example, will go a long way. In general, sour is best used to balance out sweet flavors than as a profile on its own., If you can taste the salt in a dish, you've added too much. Luckily, adding a little water can dilute an overly salted dish.If you don't mind a little sweetness, you can also add a sweet ingredient like honey to balance out an overly salty dish. However, you should only go this route if you want to add another flavor to your dish.

 You will end up with 9 rings made out of memory wire. You can have the ends of the rings overlap a little if you'd like extra space on your bracelet.Do not use your good, jewelry wire cutters for this, or they may get ruined. Use a sturdy pair of hardware pliers instead.


For a thicker bracelet, cut 12 coils.
 Pinch the end of a piece of wire with the round-nose pliers. Wrap the wire over the top of the pliers to form a loop. Pull the pliers out, then pinch the loop smaller if it is too big.Do not make a loop on both ends of the wire pieces or you won't be able to get the beads on.
 The best beads to use are seed beads, but you can add some larger, bicone beads in various places for a more interesting design. Do not cover the entire wire with beads; you need that gap at the end so that you can "close" the wire.
 This will close the wire and prevent the beads from falling off. Once you are done with all of the pieces, set them aside.
 You will be using these to hold your beaded memory wire strands together.
 The loop should be fairly small, but big enough so that the doesn't slip through the end loops on your beaded memory wire coils.
 You can separate the memory wire coils with a seed bead or a spacer bead, if you'd like something fancier.Make sure that all of the memory wires are coiled in the same direction.
 Once you have gotten all of the memory wire coils onto the short wire, use a pair of wire cutters to trim it down to Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Use the round-nose plies to fold the end of the short wire into a small loop.This will hold your memory wire strands together.
 Separate the wires into three groups. If you used 9 coils, each group should have 3 strands. If you used 12 coils, each group should have 4 strands. Loosely braid the strands together.
 Your bracelet is now complete and ready to wear!

 The fresher your roses are, the better results you will get.Try to use organic, pesticide-free roses; even though you will be washing them later on, there is no guarantee that you will be able to completely rinse all of the chemicals off. Also, try to use just one type of rose; each type has its distinctive smell, and you may not get good-smelling results by mixing them. Be sure to rinse the rose well to get rid of any dirt, insects, and pesticides.


If you wish to use the rosewater for cooking, consider using some edible roses types, such as: Rosa damascena, Rosa Centifolia and Rosa Gallica., You will need enough petals to fill one cup. This should take about two roses, depending on the size of the rose.
 Make sure that the petals are evenly distributed, and that the water level does not come too far past the petals. If you use too much water, your rosewater will be less fragrant.Consider adding up to one teaspoon of vodka. This will not affect the smell, but it will help preserve the rosewater and make it last longer., Do not let the water come to a boil or a simmer; using too much heat will ruin the color and other properties. After about 20 minutes, you will see the petals become paler, and the water take on the color of the petals.
 Make sure that the jar is very clean, and that it is big enough to hold about 2 cups (475 milliliters) of water. You will be using the strainer to catch the petals.
 Using both hands, hold the pot over the jar and tip it carefully. Slowly pour the water and petals through the strainer and into the jar. The water will pass through the strainer, and the petals will get caught in it.


Consider filling a smaller bottle with some of the rosewater. A smaller bottle will be easier to handle than a large mason jar. When you run out of rosewater, simply refill it with more rosewater from the big jar.
 The rosewater will keep about one week in the fridge.If you added vodka, it should last a bit longer.

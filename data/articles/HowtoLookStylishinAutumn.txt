 These colours blend in with the leaves and tress. Keep the outfits warm while you choose.;
, The most common colour for autumn boots is Brown, because they are always in style. If you not a fan of tall boots then try slipping on ankle boots. Try buying things for a higher price because it means more quality.
 Consider dying your hair as mouse brown because it suits the colour of the autumn clothing.
 Dressing up in jewellery is not problem in this season but never put on gold and sliver jewellery because it does not match autumn clothes.Beaded jewellery will be fine for this occasion.
 Applying natural colours for eyes would be perfect, and a light lipstick if necessary.
, Plain black scarves or a plain brown handbag is just about right, make the most of your accessories.
 The autumn look is about being comfortable and also looking a little bit casual at the same time.

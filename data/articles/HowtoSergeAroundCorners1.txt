 Begin by serging in a straight line down the first edge of your material. Donâ€™t stop when you reach the corner. Keep serging and go an inch or two past the end of the material and then stop the machine.By going past the end, you can serge over the excess stitches and this will secure them in place.;
, After you stop the machine, turn the fabric so that the next edge is lined up with your serger needle. Start serging just before the corner of the material. Serge to the end of this edge and go past it as you did with the last one.Continue to serge down edges and go past the edge each time. Turn the fabric each time you start on a new edge.
 After you have serged all of your corners, go past the edge and cut the tail so that it is about an inch long. Then, lay this tail over the corner nearest to it and serge over the tail and off to the side of the material. Then, snip off the new tail.

 The church should maintain a log concerning the bell(s) that includes date of purchase, place of purchase, make, style (including photos in case of theft) and maintenance schedule.;
, Depending on your church fund availability, you may choose to have someone employed part-time as part of the church staff or you may choose to bring in restoration and care contractors regularly.
 There are some key things that an inspection should include and you should make sure that the person caring for the bells covers these elements:


Visual overlook of the entire structure (bell, tower (steeple), wooden or steel supports etc. Any signs of cracks, aging or wear and tear should be noted and looked into.
Bolts should be examined. Loose bolts should be tightened and rusting bolts should be replaced.
Examine all pulley structures. If there is any sign of wear, stress or obstructed rotation, they may need replacement or adjustment.
Check ropes for wear. Any ropes that are fraying or damaged should be replaced.
Check out the clapper joints. These should be adequately lubricated. Adjustments may also be needed.
 Ask the person responsible to file a report of work performed and add your own observations as well.
 Occasionally you may need to consider metal restoration coatings or other refinishing activities to ensure the continued upkeep of the bell(s). This will restore the shine and glory of your bells.
 This might be a sign that the pulley blocks or wheel are loose, poorly aligned or damaged. Also look for signs of rope wear.
Muffled or stuttering bell. This could be a sign that the clapper return springs are loose or broken.
Shock comes down when ringing bell. This may be a sign that the bell is loose from its yoke connection. Immediately desist use, clear the area and call for repair. The bell is at severe risk of tumbling.

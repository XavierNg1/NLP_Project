 Before you braid curly hair, you want to make sure that it’s as manageable as possible. That’s why you should apply a detangling product first to ensure that your curls aren’t knotted or coiled together when you try to braid. Apply the product to your hair and gently work it through with your fingers to carefully get rid of any tangles.Many detangling sprays can be used on wet or dry hair.
If you’re detangling wet hair, you can use a leave-in conditioner or smoothing serum.
For dry hair, a small amount of hair oil can work as a detangler.;
, While it’s important for your hair to be free of tangles before braiding, you shouldn’t use a brush to smooth your hair. Brushing curly hair can often leave it frizzy, which makes braiding much more difficult. Use your fingers to work through your hair if it’s tangled or knotted.If your hair is too tangled for your fingers to get the job done, opt for a wide-tooth comb, which is less likely to create frizz than a brush.
 When it comes to actually braiding your hair, it’s important to work with your curls, not against them. As you’re gathering sections of hair to work into the braid, take whole curls. Don’t try to separate pieces to create sections that are the precise size that you prefer or you may wind up creating frizz.Working with your curls while braiding may sometimes mean that the sections you pull into it aren’t even. Don’t worry -- the curls will add a pretty textured detail to your braid that straight hair doesn’t have.

 Once you make a return, the store informs Ebates and they subtract money from your account. Exchanges are processed the same way, so you must return an item and then make a new purchase through the Ebates link to get the cash back on your product.
 You can receive an additional $5 for each friend you refer who makes a purchase. Click the “Tell a Friend” tab at the top of the page to start this process., Ebates will only send your money via PayPal or check if you reach this threshold.

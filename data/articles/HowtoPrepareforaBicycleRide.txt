 Pump up the wheels. Check to make sure your brakes, chain, and gear shifters are in good condition. Make sure the seat is at the right height for you, and if you plan on wearing clip-in shoes, make sure you have the right pedals on.;
, Don't wear baggy trousers that can get caught in the chain. Comfy trainers or sporting shoes with grippy bottoms are great shoes to wear, while heels or spikes would not work so well. Wear a hoodie or a jumper that won't blow lots in the wind, and be ready to take it off when you get too hot.
 You'll want that protection in case you get into any kind of accident.
 Your arms, legs, and neck are particularly susceptible to sunburn while you're cycling.
 Cycling is always more fun when you're with people you enjoy. Cycling in a larger group can also help keep you safe in case of any accident.
 You'll need to keep yourself hydrated throughout your ride, and a bite to eat can provide much-needed energy towards the end of your ride.
 Know the roads or bike paths you'll take and think about your destination.
 Bring a cell phone and make sure it's charged. It's also a good idea to bring some money.
 For example, if you're going to a picnic site, you might want to bring a pack lunch in a small backpack.
 Enjoy the ride!

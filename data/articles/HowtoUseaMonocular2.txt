 Before you use the monocular, you should locate the object that you want to view. You can position yourself by pointing your nose and toes towards the target.Keeping an eye on this object before you raise the monocular can help you locate it more easily once the monocular is on your eye.


It can be harder to find and track an object with a monocular vs. binoculars because you don't have the same perception of depth as you would with binoculars.
It might help to observe other geographic features around the object you want to track, such as a tree branch, rock, or patch of dirt. Using these markers can help you focus on the right area and find your way to your intended target.If you lose sight of the object when you place the monocular to your eye, try opening your other eye to try to point the monocular in the right direction.
 If you are observing a moving target, you will have to follow this target with your sight. Turn your head slowly to follow it. If your target moves a great distance, you may slowly move your body as well. The monocular does not move from your eye.


Sudden movements can cause you to lose track of your target.
 If your target moves closer or farther away, you will have to focus the lens as you go. This will keep the target clear in your view as it moves. Focus the lens as you move your head and body to follow the target.


You can practice this action by rolling a ball back and forth, and tracking it with the monocular. This will help you learn how to focus the lens quickly and accurately.
 It is not wise to move with the monocular pressed against your eye. Your magnified vision may cause you to miss objects that are close to you, causing you to trip or injure yourself. Always turn your body to track a moving object, but do not walk, run, paddle, or drive while using the monocular.

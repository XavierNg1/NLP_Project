 Using reduced fat milk will cause ice crystals to form when you freeze your kulfi and won't give you the same rich, creamy taste as whole milk.A wide pot will give the milk more surface area and may speed up the process.A wok, saucepan, or frying pan may all be used to heat the milk.
 Unlike a soup or sauce, the milk cannot be left to simmer on its own. You must stir the milk frequently, otherwise it will catch on the sides or bottom of the pot and burn. Reducing the milk to 3/4 its original volume will take about 45 minutes.Reducing the milk in this way will give it an incredible nutty, caramelized flavor that is missing from the "instant" version of kulfi.
The resulting condensed milk should come to roughly 2 cups.
Reducing by 3/4 is the minimum, but to get the best flavor, you may want to reduce the milk to 2/3 or even 1/3 its original volume. This gives you the most authentic, flavorful kulfi, but also requires you to stir regularly for 4 hours or more.
 Adding the sugar will temporarily thin out your mixture. Continue stirring and heating until it thickens up again, about five to seven minutes.


If you want to add other flavors, such as ground pistachio, rosewater, saffron, or mango puree, mix that in as well.
The more sugar you use, the softer the kulfi.

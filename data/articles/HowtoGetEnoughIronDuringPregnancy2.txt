 You don’t have to eat large servings of red meat with each meal. If you include meat with each meal, which contains heme iron that is easily absorbed, your body can better absorb the iron found in non-heme sources of your meal.For example, you may have a piece of chicken or white fish, half a cup of spinach, and half a cup of kidney beans, and a piece of iron-fortified wheat bread. The meat will help your body absorb the iron in the non-meat sources.
 In addition to eating iron-rich foods, you should incorporate more foods containing vitamin C with your meals. Vitamin C can help significantly increase the iron absorption of your non-heme iron plant-based foods.Vitamin C can be found in citrus fruits and citrus fruit juices, apples, pineapple, kiwi, strawberries, asparagus, leafy green vegetables, tomatoes, bell peppers, and broccoli.
 Many healthy, nutritious foods contain compounds that reduce the absorption of iron. Some foods that contain significant levels of iron, like spinach, tofu, and edamame, also contain iron inhibitors. When you eat these foods, make sure to eat vitamin C foods or meats along with these foods.Legumes, whole grains, soy products, spinach, and calcium all reduce the absorption of iron.
 You may already be limiting your coffee and tea when you are pregnant because of the caffeine. However, you should also stay away from coffee and tea because they contain compounds that can reduce your body’s absorption of iron.Find alternate beverages to drink, especially with your meals.

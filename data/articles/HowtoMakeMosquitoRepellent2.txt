 Put 1/4 cup (56 ml) of coconut oil into a pot and add the beeswax pellets to it. Use a whisk or a large wooden spoon to mix the pot until all of the beeswax pellets melt and get incorporated into the coconut oil., Pour ¾ cup (177.44 ml) of water into a separate pot and apply the lid. Set your burner to high heat and bring the water to a rolling boil. Once the water is boiling, remove it from your burner., Once you've removed the pot from the heat, you can combine your ¾ tsp (3.45 g) of baking soda. Mix the water until the baking soda is well incorporated with the water., Slowly pour the water into the beeswax mixture that you created earlier. Continue to whisk the mixture as you add the water to the beeswax. The solutions will not mix easily, so you have to keep mixing and adding water slowly, until they are combined., Add the mixture to a bowl or a cooking pan and place the pan or bowl on ice to chill the mixture. Alternatively, you can stick the mixture into your freezer for 10 minutes to chill it. Do not leave your mixture in the freezer or it will harden.
 Add at least 50 droplets of essential oils to the mix. You can use any combination of essential oils including citronella, rosemary, cedarwood, lemongrass, eucalyptus, or tea tree., Mix the repellent so that the coconut oil and beeswax mix with the essential oils. Pour the repellent into a jar or container so that you can use it later. Apply the repellent directly to your skin to repel mosquitos.


Do not expose your repellent to extreme heat or it may melt.

 Lay out your runner, starting at the altar area & secure the ends with one aisle runner stake at each corner.;
, Space them evenly along the aisle sides.
 The stakes should be carefully inserted into the ground, with the flat design overlapping the aisle runner.


The stakes should be inserted into the ground, not through the runner, gently holding it, without tearing it. A pack of 12 each aisle runner stakes is enough for one at each corner and four along each side of the runner.
For best insertion into the ground, hold the long "stick" of the stake with one hand & gently push the stake into the ground, while gently pushing on the bend, not on the top.
For best placement of the aisle runners ends, gently fold the edge of both ends of the runner before placing the stake. It is recommended to fold the runner end approx. 1 inch (2.5 cm). This will create a smoother, attractive edge & give slightly more material bulk for the stakes to hold onto.

 In a small bowl, combine equal amounts of baking soda and water. Stir the ingredients together until they form a paste that is easy to apply to the grout., Pick up the paste with your brush and spread it over the grout. You can apply it with the same brush you’ll use to scrub the grout later. Grout brushes and other stiff-bristled scrub brushes can be found at home improvement stores.If you don’t have a scrub brush, a sponge with a scouring side or an old toothbrush also work well.
 Make sure the water is warm before you add it to the spray bottle or a bowl. Combine the water with an equal amount of vinegar. Place the mixture in a spray bottle to make applying it easier., Spray vinegar directly upon the baking soda. A single spray will be enough to cause the baking soda to begin to fizz.
 You'll see the vinegar reacting with the baking soda, causing a fizz. During these five minutes, the fizz will loosen the grime on the grout., Use a grout brush to work the baking soda further into the grout. Alternatively, scrub with a stiff-bristled brush, scouring sponge, or toothbrush. Scrubbing takes some muscle power, but the effort removes most of the grime.Look out for dark areas indicating where grime remains on the grout. Try scrubbing these areas again or clean them with hydrogen peroxide.
 After scrubbing, you’ll be left with dirty vinegar and baking soda. Apply paper towels to pick up the mess or use old rags if you wish to save on paper. A sponge can also help you loosen any bits of grime and cleaner on the grout., Optionally, you can give your floor a shine. First, sweep or vacuum up any baking soda still left on the floor. Afterwards, mop the floor as you normally would. Grout you cannot reach by mop can be wiped clean by a rag dampened in clean water.

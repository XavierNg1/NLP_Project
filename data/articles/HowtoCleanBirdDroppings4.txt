 Pour a small amount of liquid laundry detergent into a container of warm water and allow it to spread throughout the water. This will create a cleaning solution you can use to spot-treat the area directly. A little goes a long way: about one part detergent to five parts water is more than enough., Laundry detergents are effective at cutting through hard, dry and greasy stains like the one you’re dealing with. Wet the hardened stain the solution to soften it. Let the laundry solution sit on the spot for two or three minutes. Reapply the solution if the stain doesn’t look like it’s softening.
 Using a scrubber brush or disposable dish sponge, scrub the area thoroughly to wipe out the stain. Keep the stain wet and sudsy by dipping the brush or sponge into the laundry solution as needed. Continue until the spot is completely gone.If you’re cleaning a delicate garment, use gentle, sweeping circular motions to ease the spot out, or use the soft side of the sponge.
If you use a sponge, throw it away after you’re finished. Yuck!

, Put the piece of clothing you’re cleaning through a regular wash cycle after you’ve scrubbed out the bird droppings. Wash on medium or high heat with like colors. When the garment comes out of the dryer, you’ll never be able to tell that it happened!

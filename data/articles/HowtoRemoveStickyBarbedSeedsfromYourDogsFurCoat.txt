 Do not try to remove the sticky seed from the dog with your bare hand or it is most probable that the seeds will become more embedded into the fur. Instead, use pantyhose, which are are excellent at removing sticky seeds with little distress to your animal.
 Place your open hand into one of the legs of the pantyhose and run your hand down to the foot-bed of the pantyhose., Run your covered hand over the dog's fur. As the sticky seeds become attached to the pantyhose, move your hand to a clean area in the pantyhose leg. Repeat the process of running the pantyhose hand over the dog's fur., If there are seeds you cannot remove, then those seedÂ might need to be removed with the tips of your fingers or, if the seeds are embedded, use a rounded tip pair of scissors to remove the remainder seeds and snip only small amounts of fur., Once your dog is seed-free, brush as usual and settle down together for a nice treat.

 Pour both your 1/2 cup (85 g) quinoa and 1 cup (236.6 ml) water into a saucepan and set the heat to high. Continue to cook the quinoa on this heat until it starts to boil which should take around 7 minutes., After the water has reached a boil, reduce the heat to low and let the quinoa cook and absorb the water. Continue to cook the quinoa in the water for 10-15 minutes, or until the liquid has been absorbed. Fold the quinoa with a spatula or spoon once it's cooked.
 In a large mixing bowl, combine the main ingredients for your peanut butter balls. Use a spoon to mix all of the ingredients together until they are well incorporated.
 Let the quinoa cool off before adding it to your bowl. Continue to mix everything together until there is an equal distribution of quinoa throughout the mixture.
 Use a spoon to scoop out a small portion of your quinoa and peanut butter mixture. Roll the dough between the palms of your hands until they form a ball. Place the finished balls on a cooking sheet lined with parchment paper.
 Place the tray of peanut butter balls in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to an hour, or until they become firm. You can store them in the refrigerator for up to a week and in the freezer for up to a month. To add extra flavor to your peanut butter balls, you can melt down dark chocolate and use it as a dipping sauce.

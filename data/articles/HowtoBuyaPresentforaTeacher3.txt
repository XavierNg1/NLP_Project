 Teachers are often relieved to have help purchasing books or school supplies for the classroom. A gift card to a bookstore, office supply, or teacher supply could help your teacher replace old materials for the start of the next semester or school year.
 Teachers also appreciate gift cards that help them to enjoy their free time. Keep in mind that either a smaller amount of money or a larger amount of money on the card is fine, but at least be sure that the gift card would be enough to purchase at least one meal or one item.

If you know your teacher’s favorite restaurant, you could get them a gift card for a meal there.
Most people enjoy going to the movies, so that’s another good type of gift card to purchase for your teacher.
 You can ask everyone in your class to contribute a little bit of money in order to buy one very nice gift for your teacher. Often, this is a high value gift card., While gift cards are technically a form of money, avoid giving cash to your teacher. This is considered inappropriate and often leaves the teacher feeling awkward or bribed.

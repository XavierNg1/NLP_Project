 Besides the glass (large drinking glass or jar will work) that will house the garden eventually, you’ll need epsom salt, water, and any food coloring you’d like to add (though it’s optional).


Access to a microwave helps to heat the water you’ll use, but especially warm tap water will work as well.
 To make the garden, you’ll be using equal parts water and salt. You’ll want to gauge how much to use based on the container that will house the crystal garden.


For a regular-sized drinking glass about five inches tall, use ⅓ cup water and salt.
 Having the water be on the warm side will aid in dissolving the salt, which is crucial to the formation of the crystals later on.


If you have a microwave on hand, put however much water you’re using in a microwave-safe container and heat for 45 seconds. As mentioned above, warm tap water will work fine.
After heated, add your food coloring if using any, no more than a dash should be required.
 Have your measured salt in the container which will house the garden. Add the heated water immediately after heating it or retrieving it from the tap.


Stir the mixture for about two minutes to dissolve the salt into the water. Some salt may still be resting at the bottom, it’s alright to ignore this.
Be sure to have oven mitts or some other heat-resistant glove if you're handling water just microwaved.
 Provided you have a refrigerator and freezer on hand, place the mixture in the freezer for 10 minutes. After the time has elapsed, move it from the freezer into the refrigerator.


If you have no freezer, it will work if put straight into the refrigerator.
Leave the mixture in the refrigerator overnight to allow the crystals to grow.
 There may be some additional liquid left in the jar, pour this out into the sink.


Using a damp paper towel, wipe the upper portions of the glass to allow a better view of the crystals towards the bottom.
Be careful not to nudge any of the crystals, they are very fragile.

 Modern day slimmers use lycra or spandex to flatten flab, keep your body smooth, and create a flattering silhouette beneath your gown.
 These garments push up your bosom while nipping in at your waist, creating a remarkably curvy figure. If you want to wear one during your ceremony, stick with a seamless bustier. For the wedding night, however, you can expand your options to molded corsets, complete with boning that shapes the torso and garters to attach stockings to.
 These undergarments cover a lot more than a simple bra, but they can look just as sexy. A teddy stops at the waist or hip, while a babydoll extends over the behind. Chemises are the longest and usually drape down to your mid-thigh. For sexier options, look for versions made from sheer or embroidered mesh. To further promote a demure look, opt for version in silk or satin.
 Most bridal lingerie is often sold in sets, and you can also buy a white bathrobe and nightgown set with white matching slippers.

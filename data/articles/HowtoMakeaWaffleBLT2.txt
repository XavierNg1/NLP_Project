 Only use the number of bacon pieces you plan to add to your sandwich. Perhaps two or three will do the job.


Cook bacon until crispy but not burned.






Drain cooked bacon on a paper towel or an iron rack that is supported by a pan (so the grease drips below).
 Consider tearing the leaves into small pieces so you end up with bite-sized chunks instead of big leaves.
 Depending on the way you like your BLT, cut thick slices especially if this is a ripe, juicy tomato.
 Consider putting the sauce on the side of the plate so you can either apply at some point or you could even slather it on the side of your sandwich.
 If you are making your own waffle from scratch and using a waffle iron, making one waffle per sandwich will work well. However frozen waffles (unless you found frozen Belgium waffles) may require two to make the sandwich.


Slice the homemade waffle into two pieces once itâ€™s cooled.
 Make sure you alternate between the bacon and tomato slices with a bit of lettuce. Add the top, spoon the sauce on the side and attack!

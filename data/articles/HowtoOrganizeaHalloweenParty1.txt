 There are so many to choose from, so start thinking now. Themes that you might like to make use of include:


Haunted theme
Ghostly theme
Horror theme
Fairytale theme
Pumpkin theme (everything orange!)
Graveyard theme
Costume theme (anything goes);
, Before you hit any store, create a list that sets out:


Decorations you'd like to have
Types of food
Music
Prizes and games (optional)
Movies (optional)
Other ideas

, This will give you an idea of numbers and the space and food needed. If you have a specific theme (like movies), you may want to limit your number so you don't end up with 12 Freddie Kruegers.


If the party is in your house, limit it to a number you can handle. After all, you're the host -- the party blunders (and successes) lie on your shoulders.
 Use your chosen theme to guide the invitation creation. Set the time, date, and give any details about what to wear, bring, etc. Send these out about two weeks prior to the party. For some invitation ideas:


Grab some black construction paper, a template off the internet, and design and cut out a witch's hat. To write in the necessary details, use a white or silver gel pen.

If a witch's hat isn't your cup o' tea, cut out pumpkins, ghosts, tombstones, or black cats out of construction paper instead. If you put it in an envelope, add in some Halloween-themed confetti for an extra touch.


Buy a bunch of small pumpkins or gourds from your local grocery store or farmer's market. In permanent marker, draw a funny face on the front and have the details on the back. Be sure to let it dry though! Otherwise you risk everything smearing.

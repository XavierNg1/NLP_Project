 Coarsely chop 1 carrot, 1 white onion, 1 celery stalk and 1 leek. Fine chop about 1 tsp. (5 mg) thyme and 1 tsp. (5 mg) parsley. Set the vegetables and herbs aside.;
, Preheat a stock pot with 1 tbsp. cooking oil and add 4 to 5 oz. (100 to 150 g) of coarsely chopped beef. Brown the meat on all sides.
 Add the vegetables to the stock pot and continue to cook the ingredients on medium heat until the vegetables begin to soften. Add the chopped herbs, 1 tsp. (5 mg) salt and 1 clove. Cover with water and let simmer for 20 minutes. Use a large spoon to skim any foam that rises to the top and continue to simmer for 5 to 10 minutes.
 Remove the stock from heat, strain, and set aside to cool. Any fat content will congeal on top of the stock when cooled, and can be scooped-off the surface with a spoon and discarded. Reserve or discard the fat as preferred.

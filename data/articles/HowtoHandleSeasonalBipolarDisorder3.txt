 Building a network of people to help you handle your seasonal bipolar disorder is a good idea for a number of reasons. For example, joining a support group can provide you encouragement, friendship, and new coping strategies. In addition, spending time with other people who have seasonal bipolar disorder can help you relieve tension by giving you a safe space to share what you’re going through.You can visit the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance at http://www.dbsalliance.org/site/PageServer?pagename=peer_support_group_locator to find a group in your area.
Ask your primary care provider or therapist for recommendations for support groups near you.
Consider joining an online support group or forum if you can’t attend an in-person support group.
 The people that care about you can do a lot to help you manage your seasonal bipolar disorder.They can encourage you and help you manage your treatment plan. They can also help you handle any stress you’re going through as a result of your disorder.


Tell the people close to you that you might need their support. For example, you might say, “This is around the time of year that my bipolar disorder gets really crazy. Could you help support me while I go through this?”
Remember that it’s okay to ask someone to just come be with you if you’re feeling a little down.
 Sometimes seasonal bipolar disorder can affect your ability to attend school or work or to be as productive as you would like to be. Having someone from your workplace or school that you can trust on your support team can help you from falling behind in your work.


You don’t need to make an announcement to all of your classmates or cubicle mates, but you may want to let one or two people you trust know that you may need their support.
You may want to ask them to let you know about upcoming deadlines in case of your absence or even just check in on you if you haven’t been in in a while.

 This will remove any potential shrinking and starch. It will make the paint stick to the shirt better.
 Cover up your table with lots of newspaper. You might also want to have some paper towels, cups filled with water, and paper plates (or palettes) handy.
 This will keep the paint front transferring to the back of the shirt. If you don't have any cardboard, you can also use a folded up newspaper or an old magazine. Be sure to smooth out any wrinkles.
 You can use a fabric painting stencil, a regular stencil, or you can make your own out of thin plastic, freezer paper, or cardstock. You can even use painter's tape to create geometric designs! Make sure that the stencil is laying flat against the shirt, or the paint will bleed under the edges.


If you are using a stencil meant for painting fabric, it will likely have a sticky back. All you have to do is smooth it down.
If you are using a regular stencil, or if you made your own, coat the back of the stencil with repositionable adhesive spray, then press the stencil down.If you are using freezer paper, iron the paper shiny-side-down onto the t-shirt. Peel it away after you paint the shirt., If you'd like to work with multiple colors, it might be a good idea to use a larger plate, or a several smaller platesâ€”one for each color.
 You can also apply the paint using a mini paint roller (preferably rubber).Lastly, you can also use a paintbrush. This will be great for delicate stencils.
 If you are using a paint roller, simply roll it on. Try to work inwards, going from the stencil's edges towards the middle. This will prevent the paint from accidentally leaking under the stencil., Fabric paint will form a thick layer as it dries, and if you remove it too late, you will run the risk of the paint tearing.
 This will give you a longer lasting design. Place a piece of cotton fabric over the design, then press an iron over it., Now your shirt is ready to wear and show off!

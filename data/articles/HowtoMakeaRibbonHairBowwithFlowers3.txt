For the first color ribbon (color 1), cut 6 x 30cm lengths and 2 x 22cm lengths.
For the second color or striped ribbon (color 2), cut 2 x 30cm lengths and 2 x 22cm lengths.



Fold the ends to the back, with a 1 centimeter (0.4Â in) overlap in the center join, leaving looped ends.
Sew into place; sew both ends at the join point, stitching to the front piece of the ribbon.
The end result will be a joined ribbon with two looped ends.
 Obviously, some will be longer than others, some shorter; this will all be "stacked" shortly, when you've done sewing.
 The basic shape consists of an asterisk - a square cross with two diagonals over the crosspiece.


Stack four of the longer lengths of color 1 first. Two lengths form the base cross, then the other two lengths make a diagonal cross over the top of the base cross. Stitch through the center to keep them in place.
Repeat, this time using the remaining two longer lengths of color 1, and the two longer lengths of color 2. Stitch in place.
Add the small pieces. Using the same asterisk formation, add the first small loop of color 1, then the two small loops from color 2, then finish with the last small loop of color 1. Stitch in place.
 Cut the shank from the back of the button. Glue the button to the center of the ribbon flower you've just made. Allow to fully dry before proceeding. If there are any trails of glue, wipe them off quickly and neatly.

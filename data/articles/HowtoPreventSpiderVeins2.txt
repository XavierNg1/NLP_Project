 Follow a balanced diet and work with your doctor to reach a goal weight that is appropriate for your height and body type. This will reduce excess stress on your feet and blood vessels.
 Salt causes your body to retain water and swell, which can put pressure on veins. Fiber prevents constipation, another form of pressure that can lead to the appearance of spider veins.


Avoid processed foods like snacks and prepackaged meals, since these are often loaded with sodium.
Eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean meats. Avoid using salt when you cook at home.
 Getting daily exercise improves your circulation even when you aren't moving, and it helps keep your body weight healthy. Focus on exercises that keep your feet and legs moving to prevent the appearance of spider veins.


Develop an exercise regimen that involves cycling, running or jogging.
If that's too high-impact, take daily walks or light swims.
Weight training is good for circulation, too. Start incorporating weights into your exercise routine.

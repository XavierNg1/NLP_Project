 It can be very difficult to identify whether an autistic child is suffering from a health condition or if there is something that is physically bothering the child. To resolve this, the child can be encouraged to express themselves through pictures.


For example, pictures that suggest the child is suffering from a health problem be it stomach pain, headache, ear infection can be used of course with words attached to them so that the child ultimately picks up the vocabulary and language needed to communicate effectively.

 A small bathroom or cramped den will look more open if the walls are painted white or in a pastel shade. Cool pastels are especially effective in opening a room.;
, The furniture does not need to be the same color, but placing furniture in a room with walls that fall within the same color family will make the colors blend more, creating an overall space that looks wider and more open.
 Bright colors draw the eye. If you want to draw attention to the walls, one wall in particular, or to the ceiling, consider using a color that is bolder than any of the other colors found in the room.
 Neutral colors, especially shades of white, fade into the background. As a result, they show less of the surface they are painted onto, giving it less presence and less visual weight.
 This technique causes the dark color to recede, creating an illusion of width, and balancing out the room's proportions.
 Darker shades force your eye to look at head level, keeping the focus on your walls and furnishings. However, dark colors can make a low ceiling appear too overbearing.
 Light colors on the ceiling attract attention. In doing so, however, they make a room look taller than it actually is, making light colors especially well suited for low- to average-height ceilings.

 Look at your hair color and use it to determine the strength of your makeup:


If it's very pale, you can get away with more over the top eye-makeup.
If your hair is dark, go with a paler look.;
,

Start in the inner corner of your eyelids with a white eyeshadow.
Use an eye primer before applying eyeshadow because colors will show up better.
Then, use a shimmery silver eyeshadow in the middle of the eyelid, then a glittery darker shadow.
Apply mascara and white and black liquid eyeliner on the top eyelid, matching where the eyeshadow is.
Finally, apply white eyeliner on the bottom lid. This looks good on everyone and it makes your eyes look bigger.
For eyes, less is often more, but if you want to look more theatrical, you can apply small rhinestones or more tones.
 Use either a pale blush, a rosy blush, or a red blush is good, depending on your skin tone. For lips, a glittery pink tone or a pale beige tone is best.

 Try to learn what works for other writers and incorporate these techniques into your own process. Writing workshops will often have you write during the time you are there. The instructor will usually talk about a particular style of writing and how to use that technique yourself. In classes, you’ll be assigned writing projects to do at home. You may also be asked to read books that discuss writing techniques.


You can find workshops by checking listings at your local library. You can also run an internet search to find writing workshops in your area. Community colleges also offer writing classes.
 Most writers who author books on writing also talk about their process, which can help you refine your own. Choose an author who writes in the same genre(s) that you do.
 Let people you trust read your work, or join a workshopping group where you can exchange your writing with other people; workshopping groups offer critiques to one another and can help you improve your writing over time while also improving the story you are working on at the time.


You can find a workshopping group through your local library, online, or through social media platforms.
If you can’t find one you like, create one with a group of friends that have similar interests.
 Receiving constructive criticism can be challenging, but try to remember not to take the criticism personally. Most other writers will have a genuine interest in helping you write better.


However, that doesn’t mean they’re always right, so take criticism with a grain of salt. Use the criticism that you feel makes the piece better; throw out what doesn’t.
Keep in mind that it’s usually a safe bet that if quite a few people point to the same part of a piece of writing over and over again, then you should probably do something to change it.

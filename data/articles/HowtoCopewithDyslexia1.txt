 One of the best ways for people with dyslexia to get organized is to simply use a calendar. Whether it’s a large wall calendar, a pocket journal, or an app, using a calendar helps you remember important deadlines and dates as well as use your time efficiently.Don’t just mark the date something is due, also mark the date you need to start, as well as any checkpoints in-between., Related to using a calendar, planning your day can help you use your time more efficiently, which can sometimes be a challenge for people with dyslexia. Think about the quickest and most logical way of doing things. This allows you to spend more time on tasks that take you a little longer.


Prioritize your tasks so that you can make the best use of your time. Think about which tasks are urgent, important, or unavoidable as well as which tasks will be time-intensive for you.
Make a schedule to help guide your day. Try to schedule things that require a lot of focus during your more productive times of the day.
Remember to include short breaks in your daily plan to allow your mind to recharge and refocus.
 People with dyslexia often struggle with remembering things. Making lists helps you be more organized and reduces the number of things you have to remember, which can free your mind to focus on tasks that require more concentrated attention.


Make lists of things you need to do, remember, keep with you, pick up, etc.
Remember to refer to your lists throughout the day – they won’t do you any good if you don’t.If you need to, make a master list of your other lists and refer to that one frequently.

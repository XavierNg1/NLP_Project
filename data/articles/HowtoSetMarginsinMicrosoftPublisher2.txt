 WordPad is a simple text processor that comes pre-installed on most Windows-based computers. You can find it under "Accessories" in the "Programs" menu when you click the "Start" button and select "All Programs."

,, Enter "0" in the Left, Right, Top, and Bottom margin fields. These values will automatically be reset to the minimum margins for your printer. Record these values for future reference.

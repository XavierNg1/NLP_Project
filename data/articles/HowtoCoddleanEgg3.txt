 Fill a shallow bowl or dish with no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of cold water. Add a little ice to drop the temperature even further.


You'll be dropping an open container into this ice bath, so the water needs to be shallow. Otherwise, the water could seep into the cooked egg when you place the container inside the ice bath later on.
 Crack the egg or eggs directly into a small, microwave-safe glass bowl.


You do not nee to cover the dish during this step.
Use a bowl with sides that are at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) tall to prevent ice water from getting inside later on.
 Heat the egg in the microwave on full power. For one egg, only microwave it for 10 seconds. For two eggs, microwave them for 15 seconds.


When done, the eggs should be slightly cooked yet still have a very runny consistency.
 Carefully place the bowl containing the eggs inside your ice bath. Let it sit there for 30 to 60 seconds to stop the cooking process.


Consider placing a lid or a sheet of plastic wrap over the bowl to help prevent ice water from accidentally seeping inside.
 Coddled eggs prepared in this manner are usually used for dressings and other recipes calling for coddled eggs rather than being eaten plain.

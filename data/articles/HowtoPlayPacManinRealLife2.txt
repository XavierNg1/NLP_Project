 The whole point of this game is to see who get the most candies.
 On that place, draw a maze. Something like the layout of the original ‘Pac Man’ game.


Don’t forget to pick a starting point for all of the players.
, When you say start, the players have to roam through their way collecting the wrapped-up candies on the floor. They can’t pass the out-of-bounds areas. If they do, then they’re disqualified from the game.
 The person with the most lollies, gets all of the lollies and is declared as the ‘winner’.

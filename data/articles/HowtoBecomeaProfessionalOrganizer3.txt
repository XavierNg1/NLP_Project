 Once you've taken a few courses and feel confident you'll be an effective organizer for potential clients, dive in and take on a few jobs. Build rapport with your clients and let them know you're available to help their friends, too. Remember that fostering positive relationships is the key to a successful professional organizing business.
 When you have a few successful jobs under your belt, it's time to officially spread the word about your new business.


Create a website. These days, having a website is one of the best ways to attract clients. Use concise web copy, professional photos, and tasteful testimonials to showcase your work. Make sure your contact information is clearly visible.
Use social media. Create a Facebook page and a Twitter account for your business. Update with musings on professional organizing trends and pictures from conferences you attend to show that you're at the top of your field.
Print business cards. Make sure to carry your business cards to conferences and trainings, and it doesn't hurt to have them handy for impromptu daily business conversations, either.
 After you've been in the business for a few years and are certain you want to make professional organizing your career, consider getting certified by the Board of Certified Professional Organizers (BCPO), which is recognized as the industry standard. This certification is not necessary to have a successful career in professional organizing but it could lend more credibility to your business. To receive certification, you must meet the following qualifications:


Have a minimum of a high school diploma or an equivalent level of education.
Have 1,500 hours of documented paid work as a professional organizer, 250 hours of which can be substituted with hours spent earning a college degree or other educational training.
Agree to adhere to the Code of Ethics for Certified Professional Organizers.
Pass the BCPO certification exam.

 A gas mask can protect you from various contaminants in the atmosphere, depending on the type of contaminant. Some gas masks protect against biological substances, while other will protect you from chemical substances. Purchase a gas mask that has been approved by a reputable government agency to protect against specific hazards. For example, if you live in the United States, a gas mask certified by the National Institute of Safety and Health, or NIOSH, is a good choice.A gas mask will not protect you from fire-related contaminants like smoke.
 A gas mask is only effective if the proper filter is used. You will need a different filter for each type of threat you might face. There is no one-size-fits all filter. For example, if you face the threat of a chemical attack from chlorine gas, you will need a filter specifically manufactured to filter chlorine gas from the air. If you also face a threat from tear gas, you will need a filter created specifically for tear gas., In order to make sure the gas mask is working properly, you will need to test it. If you received your gas mask from your employer or other organization, they should run a test with you to ensure the mask works. If you purchased your gas mask as an individual, contact the manufacturer about how to test your gas mask at home.Since every mask is different, you will need to make sure you consult your employer or the maskâ€™s manufacturer to determine exactly how to test it.

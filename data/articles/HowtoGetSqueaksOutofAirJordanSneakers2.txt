 Hold the shoe so its toes point on a slight downward angle. Apply several shakes of baby powder or talcum powder to the inside of the shoe. Upright the shoe and tilt it back and forth to distribute the powder.Massage the powder lightly with your hands into areas of the sole the squeak seemed to come from.
To more thoroughly ingrain the powder in the sole, replace the insole and wear the shoe for 10 to 15 seconds, then remove the insole.
 For the best results, allow powder to remain in the shoe overnight. In the morning, upend the shoe over a garbage. Shake and tap it lightly to remove the powder.To maintain the shape of the shoe while it sits overnight, insert a couple of pieces of bunched newspaper into it. Remove and throw away the paper in the morning.
 Take your shoes outside and/or lay a drop cloth or newspaper beneath them to catch any spills. Spray a thin layer of WD-40 over the entire sole. Apply WD-40 more precisely by soaking a cotton ball or swab in the solution and rubbing the ball or swab on the sole.


When the WD-40 is dry to the touch, your shoe is ready for its insole. Wash WD-40 from your hands to prevent eye or skin irritation.
If WD-40 gets on a visible part of your shoe, it may cause discoloration. Using too much WD-40 may be harmful to the shoe., Slip the insole back into the shoe. Without lacing the shoe, insert your foot and take a few steps. If there is no squeaking, re-lace the shoe and enjoy your de-squeaked kicks.
 Over time, your shoes may start squeaking again. This can usually be solved by another application of powder or WD-40. Shoes that squeak constantly likely have a physical defect and may require professional repair.

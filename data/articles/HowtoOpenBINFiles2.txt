 A virtual drive will emulate a physical optical drive in your computer, and will allow you to "mount" the image file in it. This tricks your computer into thinking a disc has been inserted, and the image is loaded just as if it was running from a disc.


There are several virtual drive options available. DaemonTools is one of the most popular ones available for free. Be careful when installing it, as there are several times where it tries to install browser toolbars and extra software you probably donâ€™t need.
Mounting the image will only work if the image is designed to run on a computer. For example, mounting an image of an old console game will not load anything, because the disc originally only works on that console.

Windows 8 and OS X have built-in virtual drive software, but the BIN file will need to be converted to an ISO file first.
 Programs such as DaemonTools will place an icon in your System Tray. Right-click on this icon, hover over one of the fake drives, and then select Mount Image.


Browse the CUE file on your hard drive. Remember that the BIN and CUE files need to be in the same folder. Once you've found the CUE file, load it to mount the image.
 Once the image is mounted, your computer will act as if a physical disc has just been inserted. This means Autoplay might open, or you might be asked what you want to do with the disc. The messages you receive depend on the contents of the disc as well as your system settings.


Use the image file just as you would a CD or DVD that you inserted in your computer.

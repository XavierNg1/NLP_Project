 Cat digestion is designed to process a high protein diet. A food which contains a high proportion of cereal or non-animal protein is less than optimal and may be hard for your cat to digest, resulting in insufficient calories.Read the label of your cat food. It should list a named meat as the first two or three ingredients, with cereals and vegetables way down the list. If cereals or soy are high up the list, switch foods.
 Many premium supermarket foods are highly palatable, but are made so with the addition of flavorings and therefore not nutritionally ideal. Your vet should have some suggestions about what foods will be best for your cat.


Raw food diets are high in water and nutrients. Ask if raw food would be a better choice for your pet. You can buy raw food at pet stores, online, or make at home. Be very careful that your raw food is nutritionally complete or you may end up damaging your cat's health.
A good indicator of quality is to chose a manufacturer who also creates prescription diets for the veterinary market, because their knowledge of treating ill health through diet could also cross-pollinates into their regular cat foods.
Royal Canin and Hill's are examples of over the counter foods that also manufacture prescription food.
 If your have several cats be careful to observe the dynamics between the cats and make sure the thin cat is not being bullied or kept away from the food bowl. Make sure each cat has its own food bowl, and be sure to place the food bowls at opposite ends of a room, or even in separate rooms. This makes it harder to a dominant cat to patrol the food area and prevent other cats getting access.


If you have a greedy cat that eats everyone else's portions, consider getting a microchip activated food bowl. These devices have a locked lid which is only opened when the cat approaches whose microchip bears the number programmed into the dish.

 Search “Wondershare TunesGo” on your web browser. From the results, you should click the link to wondershare.com, the program’s official website. Near the bottom of the screen, select your OS (Windows or Mac) before proceeding.


You will then be provided with two different options: “Try it free” and “Buy now.” You can either buy the app or download it for free as a trial version. You can still sync your iTunes music using the trial version, but only for a limited time.
 Locate the downloaded installer, and run it. Follow the instructions on the Installation screen to completely install Wondershare TunesGo on your computer.
 Once you have installed Wondershare TunesGo, launch it by double-clicking its shortcut icon on your desktop.
 Once you have installed Wondershare TunesGo, take a USB cable and connect the Galaxy Tab to your PC. The software will detect your Tab, and your iTunes library will open in Wondershare TunesGo.
 You will see the Galaxy Tab information on the left side of the iTunes library’s interface. From the options displayed, select “Sync” and then “Sync Galaxy to iTunes.” Now you can select what to sync from the next options. You can opt to sync the “Entire library” or “Selected playlist.” Choose your preference, and when you’re done, click the “Sync” button to start syncing the devices.

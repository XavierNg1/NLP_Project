 The most obvious benefit of forming positive work relationships is that you will take more pleasure in your job. If you look forward to seeing your co-workers each day, the act of going to work each day becomes much less stressful. Positive relationships will also help you perform better and have less stress.If it is appropriate for your corporate culture, try organizing a monthly happy hour or other activity. Spending time together outside of work is a great way to bond.
 It is important to have people who support you in the workplace. If you are overwhelmed with your workload, or you are having a conflict with your boss, it really helps to know that you are part of a team. If you have fostered positive relationships, you'll find that others are willing to help you out when you need it.

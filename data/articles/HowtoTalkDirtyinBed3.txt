 If you are not use to talking dirty in the bedroom, you might feel anxious or worried. These feelings can overwhelm your thoughts and cause your intimacy to be ruined.Practice deep breathing exercises or even try yoga.
 Focus more on the moment. If you're prone to feeling insecure you could prepare the bedroom or your wardrobe to boost your self-esteem. Set-up the mood lighting with candles or use a thin blanket wrapped over a light to dim the atmosphere.
 Don't get inspiration for talking dirty from porn. Porn is a poor representation of genuine intimacy between a couple. Watch a good movie like Match Point, Unfaithful, or Y Tu Mama Tambien.These are also great movies to watch with your partner that will get the blood moving.
 It's not supposed to be serious, and it's more fun when you can play around with ideas and words.
 Say them out loud to yourself or try using them in a sentence like normal. The more you become comfortable saying words like "sexy," "breasts," "vagina," or "penis," the less frightening the words are. They're just parts of the human anatomy.
 Doing this will give your phrases an air of personality. Verbs commonly used are 'stroke,' 'squeeze,' 'suck,' or touch'.

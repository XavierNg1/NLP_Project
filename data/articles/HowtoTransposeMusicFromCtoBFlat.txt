 The following are some B-flat instruments:


Trumpet and cornet
Tenor sax
Clarinet;
, When a piano player reads a C on the score, the note that we hear is a C. Yet when a trumpet player plays a C on the score, the note that we hear is a Bb. To make music sound right (and to reduce tension in the band) we need to write parts for the transposing instrument so that the trumpet player and the keyboard player are playing in the same apparent key.
 A Bb instrument sounds one whole tone lower than what is written, you must raise every note written for that instrument by one whole tone. The easiest way to do that is to start by writing in the correct key signature for that instrument.


Let's say the piano part is written in the key of Bb (which should have 2 flats in the key signature, and does not in the picture), concert pitch. One whole tone up from Bb is C (the concert pitch diagram starts on D it should start on Bb), so you will write your trumpet part in the key of C.
Conversely, if the piano part were written in the key of C, you would start with a different key signature: D.
 To transpose a part for a Bb instrument, start from the concert key—the key that is actually being heard—and add a whole step to it. That is the key you will use for your transposing part.


For example, let's say the concert key is the key of G major. On the chart, find the key of G major (it's the second from the top left). Note that is written with one sharp, F#. One whole tone up from G is A, so find A major on the chart, and you will see it has 3 sharps: F#, C#, and G#. This is the key you will use for your Bb instrument.
Sometimes you shift from flats to sharps, or vice versa. For example, if concert key is F major, with a Bb, one whole tone up from F is G, which is written written with one sharp, F#.
Remember to not just change the key signature, but write the notes one whole tone up as well. For example, if the note on the concert score is "F," the transposed note is "G".

 Mice can get through even the smallest of holes, so blocking them out completely may not be possible. However, making it more difficult to get in may be enough to discourage rodents.


Check around your foundation, windows and door frames for small holes, cracks or improper seals.
Use caulk, putty or weather stripping to fill any access areas you find.;
,


Use snap-style traps designed to kill the rodents quickly.
Catch the rodents in live traps, such as Have-A-Heart traps, then drive them at least a mile from your home before releasing them.



Soak rags in ammonia and put mothballs in open containers and leave them in the corners of the basement, attic or other areas of your home where rodents are a problem.
Rub peppermint oil on beams and other areas where rodents travel. You can also scatter fresh or dried mint leaves, as both the oil and leaves repel rodents.
Get a cat. Even if your cat is not a great mouser, the smell of the cat's presence in the home deters rodents.
Purchase fox, coyote or bobcat urine at a garden center or hunting and sporting goods store. Alternately, you can get some used cat litter from someone who does own a cat. Put the urine-soaked cat litter out in the basement or attic, or soak cotton balls in the urine and place them around the area.
Spread Camphor balls in the attic or places frequented by rodents.The smell is intolerable for the mice and they will stop visiting the place.

 If you don’t want to take the time to buff in a polisher or cleaner, you can select a combination product. Common brands of this type of cleaner include Armor All and Chemical Guys cleaners., The spray will be a bit thicker so it won’t run off as quickly, but it will still run off. Make sure you spray enough that even if some drips off, most of it will stay on the lights.
 After you’ve sprayed the lights with your selected cleaner, let it sit on the light for five to ten minutes. This will give the spray a chance to work into the dirt on your lights, as well as the scratches on your tail lights., Once you’ve let the spray cleaner sit on your tail lights, wipe it off with a clean rag. Your tail lights should come completely clean and also have a shine. If your tail lights are very dirty, you might have to repeat this procedure once or twice.

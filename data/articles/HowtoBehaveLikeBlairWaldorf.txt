 Blair never acts silly or messy, and she never babbles endlessly. Just stay calm and talk in a normal pace.;
, Blair always has the perfect thing to say to anyone that insults her, right away. Make sure what you say is quick, witty, and makes total sense. Here's a tip: you have to hit the opponent where it hurts the most. Find out what makes them squirm,and use that in a comeback. Don't let anyone get away with insulting you. Being quick witted and smart is always respected. If for some reason you can't think of a good comeback on the spot, stare your opponent down. Give a tiny eye roll, smirk, and look them up and down. This would make them feel insecure without you doing anything. Then you would have won the battle.
 Make sure you have at least one person who you can trust. People will want to get close to you to find out the details of your life. Don't give it to them straight away. Keep them waiting and they'll never leave.
 Whether it's grades, or talking to a new boy, always be up for a challenge and don't be shy or weak.
 Learn to be able to walk up to a random group of strangers and introduce yourself.
 Just remember though: this may not always end well on your part.
 If you look fierce, it'll help you believe you ARE fierce.
 They should know that it shouldn't happen again.

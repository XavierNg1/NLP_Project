 Allow to freeze hard.
 Wrap in the wonton/egg-roll wrappers as follows:


Place the stick on the wonton wrapper.
Fold the bottom corner over the stick of cheese.
Roll the wrapper halfway up the stick.
Fold the sides into the middle, going over the cheese stick.
Dampen the last remaining corner with a drop of water, then roll up tightly to seal.
 Arrange on a large plate in readiness for frying.
 Add enough oil to cover the sticks.
 About 30-60 seconds each side should be enough. Remove with tongs or a slotted spoon.
, Add a dipping sauce, such as sweet chili sauce, tomato ketchup or pizza sauce.

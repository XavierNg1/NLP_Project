 You want your hairs moisturized and stood upright, ready to be mowed down.
 Dirty shavers will not cut as well, and could pull hairs, leaving red marks along with several "ouchies" and expletives. Always use a clean shaver.
 Make sure all the heads touch your leg together. This will give you the closest shave with minimal wear.









You don't need to apply much pressure while shavingâ€”with just a gentle touch, let the shaver glide along your skin. If you use too much pressure, you'll flatten the hair, which results in an uneven, stubbly shave. It will also make the blades dull quicker.
A gentle touch makes shaving easier and helps avoid possible skin irritation.
 Holding it at an angle could result in skin irritation and stubble.

 Prevention and cleaning are the best defense against getting a moth infestation. Before storing any wool rugs, blankets, clothing, etc get them cleaned. Moths cannot survive on clean wool as it does not have the nutrients it needs.;
, Moths live where there is a lot of organic dust and dirt. Check in your attic, crawl spaces, eves for abandon bird or insect nests, moths can live in them and then move on to another food source, such as your wool area rug.
 Moths love dark, undisturbed, dirty areas and it doesn't take long for them to damage to your rugs.
 Moths are sneaky and will crawl 2–6 inches (5.1–15.2 cm) under a rug to lay their eggs. Old moth larva casings look like flat pieces of rice and can be the same color as your rug.
 This will make your rugs undesirable to moths. Having food, drink spills and pet accidents cleaned right away aids in moth deterrent. The sugars and proteins in such spills are what moths like.
 Getting rid of the eggs and larva fast saves your rug from permanent damage and expensive repairs.
 Moths can fly in from outside through an open window or dusty air ducts and it takes a matter of days to weeks for them to do noticeable damage to your wool area rug. Keeping your rug clean is the key to deterring moths.

 In general, you should use a Hohmann transfer if: desired radius/current radius < 11.95.
 This has the effect of raising your apoapsis (the highest point of your orbit). Burn until your apoapsis reaches the height of your desired orbit. You can calculate the delta-v for this burn using the formula in the picture., This should cause your orbit to circularise. Again, you can use the equation to calculate the delta-v for this burn.

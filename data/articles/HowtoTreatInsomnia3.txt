 If you find that you experience insomnia regularly, you may have an underlying illness or condition that requires professional treatment. Speak with your doctor. He or she may prescribe medication for your insomnia, or diagnose you with an underlying condition that causes insomnia and assign treatment for that.
 There are numerous over-the-counter medications available for helping alleviate insomnia, such as antihistamines and melatonin.Speak with your healthcare provider or pharmacist before purchasing one to ensure that you are selecting the right pill for you.


Do not rely on over-the-counter pills. Not only does the body become immune to them after a certain amount of time, but they may also have negative side-effects. Over-the-counter medications are intended to help you sleep, but not resolve your insomnia.
If you are already taking prescribed medication for some other condition or ailment, consult your doctor or pharmacist first to ensure that the sleeping aid does not react negatively with your current prescription.
 When you see your doctor regarding your insomnia, he or she may prescribe you some medication. Take your prescription according to the directions your doctor or pharmacist give you.

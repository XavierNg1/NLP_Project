 Use a doll desk or a box for the front reception area. Place some flowers on the desk, a bowl of mints and a computer or smart phone for taking appointments.


Make a small appointments book for putting in regular visitors' appointment times.



For chairs, bottle caps work well.
 Some of the pets can be workers. Place them at their relevant stations, ready for work.


It's a good idea to have one per station.

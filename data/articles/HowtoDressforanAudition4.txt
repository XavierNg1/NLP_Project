 This is your time to show off what you got, and what better way to do it is with your wardrobe. Go for it, wear that cute dress! It looks great on you! Wear those heels, they make your legs look fabulous. Be yourself with what you wear, the casting director(s) love to see you looking confident.
 T-shirts with inappropriate things on them, or shorts that let your butt hang out, show shirts from a different theater; all of that. Wearing things that could be risky is the wrong way to go. The casting Director(s) may look at you the wrong way. If you think it could possibly be risky, don't wear it. Choose something you know will be a-ok with the casting team!

, Don't take advice from the people who say "You have to wear your hair up," because that's not true. If you want to curl it, go for it, if you want to braid it, have at it! If you want to put it up in a ponytail, be my guest!

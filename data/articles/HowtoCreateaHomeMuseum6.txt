 Hang informative signs, set up you diorama, and put out your items for display.
 You will need to earn enough to run you museum and to make a profit, print tickets, and possibly pay your staff.
 You may need catalogers, exhibit design and preparation helpers, and docents. You may need to pay them.
 Maybe give people special memberships. You could even go a step farther and open you museum to the public!

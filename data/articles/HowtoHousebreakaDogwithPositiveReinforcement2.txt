 The first step in housetraining your dog with positive reinforcement is to create a schedule that you can stick to. This schedule should dictate when your dog eats, goes outside, and plays.Feed your dog at the same time each morning and night.
Take your dog outside 20-30 minutes after each feeding.
Schedule 2-3 additional potty trips each day (older dogs can generally wait longer than puppies).
Schedule a time for physical activity and play.
 Another important aspect of creating a solid routine involves selecting a "potty spot" for your dog. If you always bring your dog to the same specific spot at bathroom time, they will better understand this is the time to go potty, and not a time to play.Select an area that is:


Close to your house
Grass or soil
Specific

, While you are in the process of potty training your dog, it is crucial to supervise them at all times. If there are brief periods of time (2-3 hours max) that you cannot supervise your dog, you must confine them to a crate or one room of your house (such as the kitchen).It may help for you to:


Tether the dog to you with a leash (especially if it is a puppy).
Enlist friends or family members to help with supervision.

 Look for self-tightening straps to help the boots fit securely and leather soles for flexibility.You can also consider taking your dog directly to a big-box pet supply store (like Petsmart or Petco) to try on the boots in person instead of ordering a few sizes.


The ideal boot for your dog should be flexible enough to be comfortable, but tight and durable enough to stay on. It should also fit snugly at the ankle and have a bit of room at the toes for wiggle room., Once you’ve chosen a boot and selected an approximate size, loosen the straps or fasteners and open it completely before placing it on your dog.
 Carefully place the boot on your dog and tuck in all of its fur to make sure none is being pulled by the boot.You can use your finger as a shoehorn to help nudge your dog’s toes to the front of the boot.
 Once your dog’s paw is completely in the boot, fasten any straps. Gently press on the front of the boot to feel the clearance for your dog’s toes to see if there is any wiggle room.Try the boots on all four paws, since they may fit differently on each.
A properly fitting boot should be easy to slip on, but not so loose that it slips off.

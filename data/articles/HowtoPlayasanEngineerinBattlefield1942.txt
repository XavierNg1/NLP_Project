 A good ENG knows how to use and when to use his weapons, use your rifle for long to medium ranges and pistol for short range.;
, Engineers are more flexible than any class if you know how to use them, you can snipe, attack a base, defend a base, and take down any ground vehicle if you are stealthy.
, ENG is very bad in city maps as it is close quarters and everyone uses a machine gun (MG)

, Good maps for ENG are all desert maps, all pacific theater maps, and a few misc like Battle of the Bulge and Operation Market Garden

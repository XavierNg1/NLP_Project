 Begin heating a deep pan or wok over a medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of canola oil. The wok should be hot for stir frying, so make sure the oil has begun to sizzle before you add the main ingredients.Make sure the pan you’re using is deep enough to keep sizzling oil from splattering on you while you cook.
 Place the chopped onion and minced garlic and ginger in the hot oil. Toss or stir these together lightly until they begin to caramelize. This should only take 1-2 minutes. Searing will release the pungent flavors of the onion, garlic and ginger so that they can be absorbed by the cabbage.The edges of the onion should just begin to brown once it is caramelized.
The process of unlocking aromatic flavors from pungent herbs and vegetables is the first step in preparing many Chinese dishes., Throw in the head of sliced cabbage and toss or stir repeatedly to mix all ingredients together. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Then, pour in 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of rice vinegar. Stir fry for another 3 minutes until the cabbage has just begun to wilt. Be sure to keep the ingredients moving in the pan or they’ll be more likely to stick due to the intense heat.Stir frying is a very fast cooking method because the ingredients are all cooked together over high heat.
Be careful not to overcook the cabbage. It should be soft and tender but still retain a little crunchiness.
 Remove the stir fry from the heat and plate it with an entree, or on a separate dish if it to be served as a side. Drizzle 2 teaspoons of sesame oil over the top and garnish with a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Eat it while it's hot!In China, food is thought to be freshest when it's still steaming from being cooked. This impressive, appetizing gust of steam is known as wok hay, or "breath of the wok.",

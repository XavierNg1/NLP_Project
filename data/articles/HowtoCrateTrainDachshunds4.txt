 Your Dachshund’s crate training relies a lot on the positive reinforcement your dog receives for behaving itself. Use encouragement and rewards (e.g. treats, toys) to promote your pet’s good behavior. Allow it to associate being obedient and relieving itself outside with happy things., Crate training is an effective tool for modifying dog behavior, but it is not a long-term solution to caring for your pet. Dachshunds, in particular, are energetic, social pets that need lots of play and interaction with their owners. Crate time should be kept to a minimum once they are trained, and used to either keep your dog from destroying your belongings at times when you are not available to stop it, or for transport., If your dog has developed an affinity for its crate during training, consider leaving it out as a permanent “den” for your dachshund. While crate training is generally a short-term arrangement to teach your dog good behavior or to housetrain it, it is important for your pet to have a comfortable, stress-free place to be confined when necessary- such occasions might include car rides, visits to the kennel or veterinarian's office, renovation periods in your home, or if your dog is recuperating from an injury or illness. It is a good idea to maintain your dog’s positive associations with the crate in case you need to use it again down the line.

 This will show her that you really pay attention to the things she shares with you, and that you care about the things that are important to her. Try asking things like, “So was your boss less of a jerk today?” or “Is your mom feeling better?” or “Did you finish that book you’ve been so into?”, Many men see telling people about their problems as a practical route toward solving those problems. Many women, on the other hand, want commiseration more than practical suggestions. When your girlfriend tells you about something she is struggling with, your first instinct may be to offer solutions. Avoid this. There is a good chance that what she wants is simply to get something off her chest. If she wants advice, she will probably ask for it. Until then, a good working assumption is that what she really wants is just to feel understood., This will definitely not be appropriate in all situations, but sometimes sharing a story about a time when you experienced something similar can help validate her experiences and make her feel less alone. Don't go on too long though. You don't want to overshadow her or make the conversation all about you.
 Never say things like, “You’re overreacting,” “Don’t worry so much,” “You’ll feel better tomorrow,” “It’s not that bad,” or “There’s no reason to get so upset.” Whether or not you feel like her emotional response is appropriate, it doesn’t change what she is feeling. Don’t discount or minimize her emotions. Don’t always expect rationality, either. Emotions are not rational things, and people who are upset are not always reasonable. You should expect to be treated with respect, but don’t tell her she’s being unreasonable, or suggest taking a more rational approach. There will be time for this later. Right now your job is to listen.

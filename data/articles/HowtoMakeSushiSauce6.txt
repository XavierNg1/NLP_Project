 Cut a few small chunks of fresh peeled ginger. Place each chunk in a clean garlic press and squeeze the ginger. This will squeeze the juice out and press fresh ginger pulp through the tiny holes. Place the ginger pulp into a small bowl so you can measure it out.








You can discard or save the ginger juice for another use.
 Squeeze 3 tablespoons of Kewpie mayonnaise into your blender or small food processor. Measure out 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger pulp and place it in the blender.








If you don't have Kewpie mayonnaise, you can substitute regular mayonnaise. It just won't have the added rice vinegar flavor.
 Cover the blender or food processor and turn it on. Blend the mayo with the fresh ginger until the sauce is completely combined and you no longer find bits of ginger. Taste the sauce and adjust the flavors according to your taste.








If you'd like a creamier sauce, just add another teaspoon of mayo. For more of a spicier kick, add another teaspoon of ginger pulp. Blend again and taste.

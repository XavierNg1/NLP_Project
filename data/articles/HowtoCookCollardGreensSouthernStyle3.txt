 While the broth is simmering, you can begin to prepare the collard greens. Wash them off, then cut out the large, central stem from each green. Use a large knife to cut the greens into rectangular strips that are about 2 Â½ by 1 inch (6.3 by 2.5 cm) long., After you have prepared the collard greens, drop them into the pot. Use a spoon to push the greens and try to submerge them in the broth so that they cook evenly., Cook the collard greens, stirring occasionally. When they begin to wilt, around 15 to 20 minutes, cover the pot with a lid., Keep cooking the collard greens, stirring them every ten minutes or so. Cover them again after stirring. You should notice that the greens shrink in size as they cook, and that they will get darker and limper the longer you cook them.As you cook, the greens will absorb the broth.
 After 45 minutes to an hour of covering the greens, remove the greens and place them in a bowl or on a platter.

Some people enjoy their greens more cooked than others. Keep trying the greens and remove them from the pot when you are satisfied with their consistency and flavor.
Sprinkle in salt and pepper to taste.
 Collard greens are traditionally served with a little hot sauce as garnish. If you want to add spice and pep to the greens, pour on a few drops of hot sauce. Mix in the hot sauce or leave it as is so that certain bites of the dish will be spicier than others.

If you are already happy with the flavor collard greens, skip adding the hot sauce.
 Collard greens are meant to be eaten while hot. Taste the greens and make any final adjustments, then serve them while still warm alongside cornbread, fried chicken, grits, and any other of your favorite Southern-inspired dishes.

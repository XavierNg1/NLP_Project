You can only delete conversations using the Messenger app, even though you can see them on the mobile site. If you don't have Messenger, you can download it from your device's app store.



Scroll through the "Recent" tab to see all of your Messenger conversations.



This will delete your copy of the conversation, but the other participants will still be able to see all of the messages. The process is slightly different for iOS and Android:
iOS - Swipe the conversation that you want to delete from right to left. This will reveal the "Delete" button. Tap "Delete" to remove the conversation.
Android - Press and hold the conversation that you want to delete. Select "Delete" from the menu. Confirm that you want to remove the conversation.

Start the Atkins diet by going through Induction. During this period, you will eat no more than 20 grams of carbohydrates per day, and that total should contain 12 to 15 grams of carbohydrates from foundation vegetables.
Continue into Ongoing Weight Loss (OWL). After the 2-week Induction period, gradually add carbohydrates to your daily total to find your carbohydrate level for weight loss (CLL).
Start Pre-Maintenance after OWL. When you are within 10 pounds of your goal weight, continue adding carbohydrates to your daily total until your weight loss slows to a crawl. This will help you to determine your carbohydrate equilibrium that you can utilize in Lifetime Maintenance.
Progress to Lifetime Maintenance. Eat the number of carbohydrates each day that you can safely consume without losing or gaining weight.

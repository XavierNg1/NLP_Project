 You're not strange or broken.
 You can learn how it works, how it's treated, and what things you can do at home to improve your sensory processing abilities. The internet is full of resources that can help you.


Autistic people often have SID too. They tend to congregate in blogs and under the hashtags #actuallyautistic and #askanautistic. Many of them are quite helpful and can offer tips about managing difficult stimuli. You may even make some new friends that way!

, Since you're the one dealing with them, this should be reasonably simple. Make a list of things that cause you distress. Consider sharing it with parents, siblings, or trusted friends, so they know how to help you. If possible, carry the list with you. Every time you realise there's something missing, write it down!

, For example, if loud sounds cause pain for you, you can ask if you are allowed not to attend school assemblies in the gym, rather than spending them covering your ears or feeling uncomfortable. Sensory issues are a legitimate medical reason and your school or employer should honor them within reason.


Research what sort of accommodations can be made for autistic people, as plenty of those are for sensory issues., If your insurance covers occupational therapy, it can be considerably less expensive to you. Research the costs and benefits of sensory integration therapy. If you live with your parents, explain the benefits to them and ask if you can start seeing an occupational therapist.
 For example: "Does this sweater feel scratchy to you?", "Do you hear that buzzing sound (of those fluorescent lights)?", et cetera.
 Find hobbies that relax you, and set aside time to do quiet activities each day. Downtime is especially important when you have sensory issues, because it allows you to stay balanced and avoid meltdowns or shutdowns.
 Feel free to jot down ideas on the same list!

 Making the applesauce will allow you to control the amount of sugar and preservatives, resulting in even healthier baking.









To make your applesauce, wash, core and quarter 2 lb. (908 g) of apples. Put them in a large pot filled with water that is at least an inch (2.5 cm) deeper than the apples. Boil until the apples are soft. With a bit of cooking water or unsweetened apple juice, put them through a blender or food mill. Add 1 tsp. (2 g) of spices like nutmeg and cinnamon.
For baking purposes, use unsweetened applesauce. Add up to 1/2 cup (96 g) of sugar or 1/3 cup (113 g) of honey to homemade applesauce, if you plan to eat it on its own.
Reduce the amount of sugar you use in a recipe if you are using sweetened applesauce.;
, Applesauce should be substituted for these ingredients, but not softened butter. The substitution works best for cakes, muffins and quick breads.









Substituting applesauce for oil or butter in cookies is not recommended. It can result in mushy cookies that do not hold their shape.
 For example, 1/2 cup (118 ml) of oil is equal to 1/2 cup (56.5 g) of applesauce.
 For example, if a recipe calls for 1/2 cup (118 ml) of oil, substitute 1/4 cup (28.3 g) of applesauce and also add 1/4 cup (59 ml) of oil. Taste the result and move toward replacing more oil with applesauce next time if it compliments the recipe.









You do not need to substitute all of the oil to get a healthy effect. If your recipe turns out better with a little oil and a little applesauce, you can consider it a healthy substitution.
 This will provide a more accurate measurement than using a dry measuring cup.
 This will ensure the applesauce is well mixed. The recipe will also turn out to be more moist, if the dry ingredients are mixed with the wet ingredients right before baking.
 Low-fat recipes should not be over-baked as they can be extra dry.

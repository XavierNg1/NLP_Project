 Unbutton any "gauntlet" buttons all the way up the sleeve, and remove cuff links. If you're wearing a sweater over your shirt, this cuff won't work, so you'll have to take it off.
 Instead of folding the cuff where it meets the sleeve of the shirt, pull the end of the cuff all the way up to your elbow. Your sleeve will be turned inside out.
 Use your fingers to pull back the bottom edge of the sleeve and pull it up to the bottom of the cuff.
 You could also opt to cover the cuff entirely; just pull the inside-out sleeve completely over the cuff.

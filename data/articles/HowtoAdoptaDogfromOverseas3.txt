 If you're taking a dog back with you from vacation, or bringing a dog back after visiting, talk to your airline. Make sure you're allowed to bring your dog on the plane and figure out the cost and requirements for air travel with a dog.Airlines often charge extra for you to bring a dog with you. It can cost anywhere between $200 and $2,000 to transport a dog from overseas.
If cost is an issue, reach out to a charity organization like Pilots N' Paws to see if they can help with some of the cost. If you're already working with an adoption agency, they may be able to have the dog transported for you at a reduced rate.
 If it's not possible to have a dog on an airplane with you, you may be able to check the dog as baggage or unaccompanied cargo. The dog would still be on the plane, but not in the cabin with you. Explore these options if your airline does not allow dogs on the plane., The majority of countries will have some form of airport inspection. This is usually conducted by a veterinarian at the airport. The purpose is to make sure your dog is disease free before it enters your country.You may also have to present paperwork, such as a proof of rabies vaccination, at this point. Make sure you have your paperwork ready to go when you meet with an airport veterinarian.
You want to make sure you enter the country when the airport vet is ready to conduct an inspection. Some airports may not have vets on staff all the time, so getting your dog past customs may require some waiting.
 Local regulations for overseas pets vary, even within the same country. Once you and your dog get home, contact state animal health officials. They can help you complete any remaining paperwork to finalize the adoption process.

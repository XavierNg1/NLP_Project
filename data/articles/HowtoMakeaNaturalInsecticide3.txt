 Pyrethrins have been used in commercial insecticides for years. Painted daisies are also known as pyrethrum daisies.


Pick the daisies when they are in full bloom.
Hang the daisies to dry in a dark, dry place.
Pulverize the flowers in a blender or using a mortar and pestle. The insecticide will be more effective the finer it is crushed.



Or, make a solution of .35 oz. (10 grams) of crushed pyrethrins in 3 quarts (2.84 liters) of warm water. Allow the solution to sit for 3 hours.
To increase the power, add 1 tsp. (4.92 ml) of sesame seed oil or liquid dish detergent.
 Spraying may excite the pests, so spray the bugs again if you see them moving around.


Spray when it is cooler outside because pyrethrins are most effective at lower temperatures.

 You can soak pans or pots overnight in an acidic solution to weaken the rust, then remove it later. Some options include:


Baking Soda and water
Vinegar
Lemon juice.
 You can mix in a little water too to cut the acidity. Add 1-2 tablespoons of salt for even better results.
 You can use steel wool for bigger patches of rust, but a lemon rind is actually one of the best scrubs you can use for gentle washing.
 Be sure to rinse the pan out between soakings however, as the vinegar could damage the finish if left on for too long.

 If your dog begins to change their behaviour, then you should take them to the veterinarian. Do not assume that your dog’s new clinginess is simply related to aging. Instead, you should talk with your veterinarian to see if this behavioural change is a symptom of a larger medical problem. For example, your dog may be in pain and find comfort in your presence. Pain relieving medication may help alleviate this symptom. Your vet may be able to prescribe medicine to help comfort your dog.
Alternatively, the change in behaviour may not be treatable and is just a sign of aging.
Ask your vet "How can I provide my dog with comfort in old age?" or "Should I pay more attention to my dog since it is being clingy?"
Some anti-anxiety medications can cause the urine to turn pink, dizziness, dry eyes and mouth, lethargy, loss of appetite, nausea.If any of these symptoms occur take your dog to the vet.;
, If your dog is suffering from extreme separation anxiety, you may want to talk with your vet about anti-anxiety medication. Anti-anxiety medication can reduce the level of anxiety in your dog and may help to decrease any destructive behaviour that happens as a result of the anxiety.For example, your dog may act out and eat something or go to the washroom in the house when you are out.
 Your dog may be clinging to you because they are uncomfortable. Once you have talked with your vet about their change in behaviour they may tell you to change your dog’s diet. There are a variety of specialty foods that can help dogs with different medical conditions.. For example, you can get special food for dogs suffering from kidney failure or other medical issues.


Talk with your vet to see if a change in diet would help alleviate your dog’s symptoms.

 Some people prefer to leave their concrete countertops natural and without sealant. This is fine, but it makes the surface more susceptible to scratching and staining. If youâ€™d like to avoid this, you can purchase a concrete sealing kit at your local hardware store or ask your contractor to add it on. This will make your countertops last longer.Make sure to follow all of the application directions carefully and only use a food-grade sealer., Prevention is the best way to minimize deep cleaning. If you see a stain developing, tackle it immediately by applying a targeted dose of cleaning solution to that area. You can also just keep a few towels nearby and make a habit of wiping down your countertop every time after cooking.Be aware that you can also scratch concrete by cutting on top of it. Make sure to use a cutting board., This is a bit different from a stain. Etching occurs when acidic substances, such as lemon juice, actually eat through a part of your sealer and reach the concrete underneath. To prevent this from happening, you may need to polish out the spot with a low grit diamond wiping pad and then reapply sealer as directed on the package.Etching often appears in the form of white spots., On a monthly basis, and after a deep cleaning, apply a coating of wax to your countertops. You can buy concrete-safe wax at the hardware store. This wax will help your counter to resist spotting and staining. It will also leave it with a nice shiny surface.

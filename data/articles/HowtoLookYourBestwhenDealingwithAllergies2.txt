 When you have allergies, your skin can get dried out, particularly if it's cold out. To help combat that dryness, use a facial moisturizer after you've showered. You don't even need to dry off before you put it on, as it will seal the moisture in.Don't forget your lips. Use a good lip balm, that's oil or cream based.
Also, drinking more water can help your skin and lips stay hydrated.
 Start with a good foundation of your choice that matches your skin tone. Next, in areas that are particularly red, such as around your nose, add a green-tinted concealer. The green tint helps cancel out the red, smoothing your complexion. Blend in the color as much as possible. Finally, add a creamy, skin-toned concealer on top of everything for a smooth finish., Contouring is the application of creams in colors that are slightly darker and slightly brighter than your skin tone to create more defined ridges and shadows on your face. For instance, you can use contouring on your cheeks to help reduce the look of puffiness.For highlighting, try making a "fish face" by pursing your lips. That helps draw your cheeks in so you can see your cheekbones, where you can add some highlighter. Be sure to blend it in.For more definition, you can add a bit of shadowing just under your cheekbones.
Another place to add a dab of highlighter is under your chin.
You can also just use a bit of bronzer to brighten up your face. Brush it along the top of your forehead, cheekbones, nose, and chin., Makeup tends to move around anyway, and if you have allergies, that problem just gets worse. A setting spray is sort of like hair spray for your makeup. You spray it on to "set" the makeup so it's less likely to move around.

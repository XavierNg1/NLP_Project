 While changing your cat’s diet can resolve some symptoms, most cases of established bone growth and fused joints are irreversible. Ask the vet to recommend an anti-inflammatory drug or topical ointment to help manage your cat’s pain.Depending on bone and joint issues’ severity, your cat might need medication to manage pain for the rest of its life.
 Limited mobility can prevent your cat from easily climbing into its litter box or bending its neck to access food and water. Elevate its food and water bowls so they’re closer to its mouth level to make feeding easier. Get a litter box with lower sides and, if your cat goes upstairs or downstairs, provide a box on all of your home’s floors., If vitamin A toxicity resulted in limited mobility, self-grooming will also be difficult for your cat. Help it groom itself by wiping down its coat daily with a warm, damp washcloth. Be sure to clean areas like the lower spine and hind legs that your cat might have trouble reaching.

If your cat has long fur, brush it weekly to prevent matting. Consider trimming fur that’s prone to matting and soiling around its hind legs and rear end.

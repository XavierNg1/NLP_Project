 This will help your child understand that disabled people are really not that different!;
, When your child spots a disabled person in the street, you need to answer right there and then. Say something like:


"It's hard for that girl to walk, so she uses the chair to move around better."
"He can't see very well, so he uses a cane to help him feel if he's going to bump into things."
"Some people are born with only one arm, and sometimes people have an accident and lose their arm. I don't know why she has one arm, but that's okay, because it doesn't really matter."

, This helps normalize the idea of disabilities, so your child feels comfortable around disabled people.


Do not send your child to talk to the disabled person or ask him/her questions. While it may seem like a teachable moment to you, it quickly becomes an annoyance to disabled people, who have to deal with both stigma and random questions from strangers. It is very rude to assume that "she won't mind" when, in fact, she may actually be walking to a meeting or absorbed in deep thought.
If your child is old enough, you could teach them about stigma, the disability rights movement, and invisible disabilities (such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, autism, and schizophrenia).
 Yes, they may have a little more trouble to go out and about, but they manage just like everyone else!


The same goes for admiration, which is really "pity in disguise."

 Everyone was a beginner at some point, so they understand what it's like to be new at MMA. The people at the gym are there to learn and become better fighters so don't act like a hotshot or you'll give off a bad first impression. Be nice to the people you meet, keep a positive attitude, and be receptive to advice., When you start training it's important that you follow all of the instructions given by your instructor. If you don't, you could injure yourself or someone else. Pay close attention to everything your instructor has to say and try to execute the moves exactly as you're taught., During your first couple of classes, you may feel like you have something to prove, but you don't. You might be tempted to go full intensity as soon as you hit the mat or ring, but this will just make you exhausted and unable to train further. Remember to breathe deeply and try to execute the moves and work on your technique rather than exhausting all of your energy., If you don't have experience with martial arts, it's possible that you'll be sparring against someone more experienced. Don't expect to be amazing at fighting if you've had no training. It will most likely take you a lot of hours and work training before you can compete in your gym. It's important to keep this in mind so that you don't get discouraged.

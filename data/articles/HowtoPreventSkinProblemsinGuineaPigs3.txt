 Vitamin C is a very important nutrient for guinea pigs. Without enough vitamin C, guinea pigs can develop skin problems. Because guinea pigs cannot make their own vitamin C, they must get it from their diet.Feed your guinea pig vitamin C-rich foods, like vitamin C-fortified guinea pig pellets and leafy greens (spinach, romaine lettuce, parsley).After about three months of storage, guinea pig pellets start losing their vitamin C. To make sure your guinea pig gets enough vitamin C, consider giving it a vitamin C supplement.Talk with your vet before giving your guinea pig a vitamin C supplement.
 Not only is hay very healthy for a guinea pig, it can help prevent barbering.If your guinea pig is chewing its own hair, feeding it hay will give it something else to chew on.This will prevent further barbering.


If you have multiple guinea pigs in one cage, placing hay in the cage may prevent barbering. If it doesn’t, then separating the fighting guinea pigs will be the best way to stop the barbering.
 Keeping your guinea pig stress-free will help prevent skin problems.One way to minimize stress is to avoid overcrowding your guinea pig’s cage. The website http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/guinea_pigs/tips/guinea_pig_housing.html has guidelines to help you determine how many guinea pigs can fit comfortably in a cage, according to cage size.


You can also minimize stress by giving your guinea pig plenty of toys. Guinea pigs like cardboard toys, like empty toilet paper or paper towel rolls.
Guinea pigs like routine. To keep your guinea pig from feeling stressed, keep its daily routine as steady as possible.For example, keep its diet the same and handle it at about the same time each day.

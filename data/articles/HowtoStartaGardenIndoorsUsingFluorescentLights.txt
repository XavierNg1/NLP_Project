 Most people use basements but it also works in a room with windows. I like to put the plants in a room such as a living room. The only problem with this is that it takes up space. The reason I like to do this is because the plants have sun but when it's raining you can turn on the lights and they will still get the things they need.;
, If you only have a couple plants, then you could use a plastic box which can be bought at Walmart. You want the box to be plenty big and deep enough for the roots to grow.
 After you've found your spot and planted your plants, you need to set up the lights. Fluorescent light bulbs have both of the rays that are needed to make plants grow. Fluorescent light fixtures can be bought at your local home department store such as Home Depot or Lowe's. The only thing is that when you hang them they are on pulleys so you can adjust them as the plants grow. If they are not on pulleys, you can stack books under the box when you hang the lights and remove them as the plants grow taller. Plants should have 12 to 16 hours of steady light daily.
 You will also want to keep the soil damp just as you would with any other garden. Just make sure no water leaks out onto your floor if you're not using a plastic box. You can buy a plastic water pan to go under the box to collect the water.

, The sponges will reduce the echoing noise a lot. As an added bonus, you will also find that the washing machine stops trying to wander across the floor as it spins!

,, If you have a washing machine that sits inside a cupboard or built-around shelving, you might be able to add insulation that reduces the sound. Cut some foam sheeting into thin sheets and attach to the inside of the cupboard or shelving with suitable adhesive. Don't forget to insulate the cupboard door as well.
 When using the washing machine, keep the laundry door closed. If it has large gaps underneath, attach a door draught stopper to help keep the noise in the laundry.
 If the noise from your washing machine is above the ordinary hubbub of a machine doing its washing thing, it's probably time to get the washing machine serviced.

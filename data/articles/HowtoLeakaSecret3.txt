 You leave fingerprints on everything that you touch. When you print and pick up the documents, wear gloves. Also be sure to wear gloves when you put the documents in the envelope and any time you handle the envelope.
 Since your writing has a distinct trademark, it can actually be studied and traced back to you by professionals. For this reason, you'll want to avoid address the envelope by hand. Printing a label is a quick way to avoid your writing giving you away.


If you don't have access to a printer, write the address with your non-dominant hand or alter your typical writing style as much as possible.
 It may seem obvious, but you don’t want anyone to know who sent the secret document, so don’t write your address on the envelope. Make sure that you still paste a stamp on the envelope, though, or the letter might not get where it’s meant to go., Never mail secure documents from your house because it may be traced back to you. Drive somewhere that’s relatively far from your house and leave the envelope in a public mail collection box.

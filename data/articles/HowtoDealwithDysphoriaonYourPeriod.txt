 There are many different kinds that can do that: oral contraceptives taken continuously, hormonal IUD's, and other types. Talk to your doctor to find out if one could work for you.;
, There is a wide range of options for dealing with menstruation, beyond just disposable tampons or pads. You may find that a menstrual cup is better, because you feel normal and don't have to think about it so much; or that reusable pads are best because they're more comfortable than pads but don't need to be inserted.
 It's always important to do that, but especially at this time. Do what you need to do to stay happy and calm. Take a little time out of your stressful day to relax and do something you love.


Have a warm beverage, like tea or cocoa.
Play with a pet. They don't care what you look like, only that you're nice to them.
Listen to comforting music.
If you're struggling with overwhelming emotions, try to talk to someone supportive-a parent or sibling, a friend, a counselor or therapist, etc. Another alternative is writing in a journal.
Take a hot shower or bath, or place something warm on your abdomen, like a hot water bottle, a warm towel, or even your laptop.
 This will help make your period lighter and shorter.
 While these may increase your flow, the pain relief may clear your head a bit.
 When you feel like your body is going against who you are, tell it who's boss. Work on looking more like how you want.


Push-ups will make your shoulders wider.
 That shirt that always lets you pass? The pants that make your hips look just right? Your binder? Perfect.
 These kind of products may be harder to find than your average pair of underwear, but they are available. Alternatively, you can make your own pad-friendly.


If you have light flow, try wearing 2 pairs of underwear. People with light flow may be able to do this without wearing pads. Just insure that the one on top is black and tight enough to prevent flow down your leg. This may help avoid staining and dysphoria.

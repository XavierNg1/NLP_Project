 These locations are the best place to seek moisture.;

If you are in dryer conditions, the moist subsoil may be slightly deeper. Dig until you find it.
Do not dig the hole/holes in the shade. This process needs direct sunlight to work correctly. Look around and make sure that shade won't move over your solar still before evening arrives.

If you have a length of plastic tubing, you can run it from the bottom of the coffee can out the edge of the hole. You can use the tubing to suck the water from the can without dismantling the still.

Pour the sand 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) from the edge of the plastic wrap. Ensure that there are no gaps. The plastic wrap must seal the hole shut; if it is punctured, the water will not condense.
 Keep the plastic wrap from touching the can or else the water will not drip into the can.
 The water will condense on the plastic wrap because it cannot escape the hole and will drip into the can. If you have installed plastic tubing, drink from that.
 Alternatively, you may dig deeper using the established hole/holes.

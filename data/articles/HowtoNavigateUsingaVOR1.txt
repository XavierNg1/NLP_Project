 Tune the VOR frequency in the navigation radio. It will be listed on VFR and IFR charts as well as instrument approaches if it is a part of the approach. Identify that you have the correct station and the signal is reliable by listening to the Morse code identifier. If you see a red “NAV” or “VOR” flag, barber pole, or OFF instead of a TO/FR indication, the signal is unreliable, you are overhead, or roughly 90º from the selected radial. The signal is unreliable when you cannot hear the Morse Code identifier. A red “GS” flag is not a VOR indication.
 Determine which radial you are on by turning the OBS (Omni Bearing Selector) knob until the CDI (Course Deviation Indicator) needle is centered and you have a FROM indication.


Looking at the picture above, you can see that the needle is centered and the instrument gives a FROM indication (as a small white triangle is showing and pointing down); so the aircraft is on the 254 degree radial. It doesn't matter what the heading of the aircraft is; it is located somewhere along a line 254° from the VOR station. In order to fly to the VOR station, you would first twist the OBS knob until the needle is centered and the white triangle appears, next to the "TO" designator (in the opposite direction, or up, from the "FR" designator). Note that this will be 074 degrees, exactly 180° from the current radial. Now turn the aircraft to this new heading and keep the needle centered -- this will take you to the VOR station.

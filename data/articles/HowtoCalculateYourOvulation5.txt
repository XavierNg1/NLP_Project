 An OB/GYN or a reproductive endocrinologist can perform tests that are more accurate than home methods.These may include a blood test to measure levels of progesterone and other hormones, or tests to detect abnormalities in thyroid function or prolactin levels, if your doctor thinks these are likely. An ultrasound test can be used to detect structural abnormalities in the reproductive tract that could be affecting ovulation., Men can also be tested for infertility. This typically begins by testing a sperm cycle, and may continue to an ultrasound exam to detect possible issues in the male reproductive system., If a doctor does suspect you are infertile due to anovulation (lack of ovulation), she may recommend one of a variety of drugs, depending on your exact condition. Do not assume that lack of conception is due to lack of ovulation without an official diagnosis, as there are many other possible causes. Your doctor should also examine the possibilities of blocked fallopian tubes, sperm-related problems, uterine or egg implantation problems, and age-related decline in egg quality.

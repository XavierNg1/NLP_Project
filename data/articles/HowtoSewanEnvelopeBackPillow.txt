 Making sure that the corners are perfect, use a triangle ruler, measure and draw a rectangle that measures 16" x 36". You can add a seam allowance if you'd like. Cut along the lines and you have your pattern.;
, Lay your fabric down and make sure it's smooth with no wrinkles. Put your pattern over top the fabric, and pin it down to keep it in place. Cut right along the edges of the pattern. You should have a perfect 16" x 36" rectangle of fabric.
 Make markings 10" from the short ends of the fabric, on each side. If you don't have marking chalk, you can cut a small snip in the fabric to mark it.
 Thread your sewing machine, making sure the needle is sharp. Set up your iron and ironing board for pressing the hems.
 Measure and fold down 1/4" along the short ends of the fabric, folding the wrong sides together. Press with iron, and repeat so that the raw edge is enclosed.
 Keep your stitches as close to the loose edges as possible. Repeat on both ends.
 Fold the hemmed edge of the fabric in toward the center until you reach the mark you made 10" from the end. Make sure the fabric is folded with the right sides together. Repeat for the other side. The hems should overlap each other in the center. Pin the sides in place.
 If your sewing machine has a zig zag setting, zig-zag the raw edges to keep them from fraying.
 This sets the stitches into the fabric. Turn the pillow right side out and then press all around the edges.
 Or you can buy a 16" x 16" pillow form to place inside!

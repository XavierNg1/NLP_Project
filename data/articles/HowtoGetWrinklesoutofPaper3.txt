 You can create a great deal of steam in your bathroom if you turn on your shower as hot as it will go and close the door. To fill the room, you’ll want to wait at least 10 minutes so the steam has time to build., Once there is plenty of steam in the bathroom, you can set the page down so the steam can help relax its fibers. Make sure that it’s not too close to the shower, though, because you don’t want any moisture to develop on the paper. Check that it isn’t folded or creased in any areas either.Wherever you plan to set the paper down, it’s a good idea to lay down a clean towel first. It will absorb any moisture that might be on the surface from the steam, so you don’t have to worry about the paper getting too wet.
 In order for the steam to help the paper release the wrinkles, you’ll need to keep it in the bathroom for approximately 10 minutes. If the page is severely wrinkled, you may want to give it extra time -- but check on it every so often to ensure that it’s not absorbing too much moisture., After the paper has been steamed, remove it from the bathroom, and place it on another flat surface. While the steam may have helped release some of the wrinkles, you should use your hand to press over it again while the paper is still relaxed from the steam. Be gentle, though, because you don’t want to tear or damage the page.You may want to cover your hand in a clean hand towel before smoothing the paper. That will help protect it from any dirt, oils, or other debris that might be on your skin.
Even if you manage to smooth most of the wrinkles out of the paper, you may want to place the paper under a heavy weight for several hours to a day in order to further press it.

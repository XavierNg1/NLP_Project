 You'll need a hammer, a screwdriver, and a strip of paper.
 Place the screwdriver at the bottom of the hinge pin and use the hammer to tap the bottom of the hinge pin until it comes up out of the hinge.
 Fold your strip of paper until it is about .5-1 cm wide, and just a bit longer than the hinge. Place the paper in the hinge pinhole and fold the top down just a bit so that the paper stays in place.
 Put the pin back in the hinge. This may take some hammer tapping.
 Test to see if the door now stays open when you open it. The paper should make the hinge tighter, keeping the door where you place it.
 If one piece of paper doesn't work, you might need two. You may also need to put paper in the other hinges as well. Experiment until you get your door working the way you want.

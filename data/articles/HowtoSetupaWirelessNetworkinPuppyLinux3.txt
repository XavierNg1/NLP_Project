If under "Interfaces" (or "Driver Modules" if Puppy 2 series) a wireless device appears skip to "Connecting to a network" (below).



If your wireless adapter isn't found automatically, find the manufacturer and model, choose it from the list and click OK.
If your wireless adapter isn't on the list, check WirelessWorking for a list of cards which may work with Puppy.
If your wireless adapter isn't on the list, choose "ndiswrapper" from the list and choose your Microsoft Windows driver (.inf file) and click OK until you return to the Network setup screen.

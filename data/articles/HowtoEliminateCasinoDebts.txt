 You will not be able to pay off your casino debt if you continue to gamble. The process of eliminating debt begins with a decision to get your finances back in order and not let them get out of hand again.;
, Purchases need to be paid in cash from now on because credit cards only defeat the purpose of getting rid of debt. If you are concerned, ask a trusted friend or family member to hold onto an emergency card for you. Stress to that person that you cannot have it back under any other condition.
 Calculate all the money coming in, such as your income. If you cannot realistically cover payments for the debt and other monthly expenses, then you need to cut back. If cutting back is still not enough, you need to consider getting a second job, at least until the debt is paid off.
 Include everything that you "need" to survive. Until your regular and casino debt is paid off, your "wants" should not be a factor.
 Make sure that the additional amount goes toward the principal, not the interest. You will pay the minimum balance on the rest of your debts in the meantime, and continue to pay the rest of your bills on time. Pay the largest debt in this manner until it is eliminated. Move onto the next card or obligation, and start paying additional money toward that. Continue on until all obligations are paid off.
 Whether it's a tax refund or a bonus, put any extra money that you receive toward the debt.

 Into the mixer add the milk, yeast, butter, egg, sugar, flour, cinnamon, allspice, salt and the currants. Mix it together but only until it is just combined.


Sprinkle a little flour onto the dough. Then remove the bowl from the mixer.;
, Dust the work surface with flour. Remove the dough from the mixer bowl. If it seems to be too sticky, then add a little more flour.


Knead it with your hands until the dough forms an elastic consistency.
 Place it in a bowl, cover it with a towel and let it rise until it doubles in size.
 Punch the air out of the dough with your knuckles. Then remove it from the bowl.
, Cut the dough roll into six pieces:


Take one piece and shape it into a ball, by first folding the dough inwards then rolling it with the palm of your hand.
Roll all the five remaining pieces into balls.
 Cover them once more with the towel. Let them rise again for about 30 minutes.
 While you're waiting for the dough to rise, set the oven to 170ºC, 325ºF or gas mark 3.
 Brush the buns all over with the egg wash. Then using the knife, cut a deep cross into the centre of each bun. The deeper the cut, the more pronounced the cross will be when baked.
 Bake them for about 15 minutes, then remove.
 Let the buns cool for a few minutes. They can be served hot or cold. They are absolutely delicious when served warm, with plenty of butter.

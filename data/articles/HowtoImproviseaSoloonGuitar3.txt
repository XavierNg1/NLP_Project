 Call and response is popular is several styles of music. It uses conversation as a metaphor for playing music. One way to utilize call and response is by accenting certain notes during a solo in response to what other musicians' are playing. Another is to create a "call" on your instrument and have your band respond with a unified "response".This technique is also called "question and answer" in jazz improvisation and can be used within your own solo. Pose a "question" with a series of notes, then "answer" that question with your next series of notes.
 A great way to bring all the musicians together during a solo is by playing a motif of the song. A motif is a repeated melody that is usually a short phrase. The motif could be from a riff during the verse or might even be part of the melody from the chorus. Repeating the motif during your solo is a good way to indicate to your band to change something.Oftentimes the main melody from the song acts as a motif and indicator to the other musicians.
You might use it to speed up the band, slow the tempo down, change into the verse, or even end the song.
For an example of a band's relationship with a motif or main melody and repetition, listen to John Coltrane's version of "My Favorite Things."

, All musicians should keep one ear focused on what they’re playing and the other ear focused on the band. One part of listening is centered around keeping an eye out for signals or cues your bandmates might physically give off. Even while you are soloing, it will help you to occasionally glance up and check in with your band.A guitarist that overplays and doesn’t consider the rest of the band is a bad guitarist. It’s important not to overstep your solo and keep the mood in a unified spirit.

 Feathers are often a conspicuous sign of illness in birds. Not preening, consistently ruffled feathers, areas with thin or no feathers, matted feathers, excessive molting, rapid changes in color, and picking out feathers can all be signs of illness in lovebirds.Any of these symptoms individually is concerning. If you notice even one of these, contact your avian vet immediately.;
, Problems with the beak can indicate any number of problems, including the critical Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD).Check to see if the beak is overgrown, flaky, loses symmetry, discolored, or if there is discharge around the nares.If you suspect your bird may have PBFD, isolate them from any other birds immediately and make an appointment with your vet, as this disease is highly contagious.
 Abnormal droppings could be signs of a serious illness, including PBFD and Chlamydiosis. Look for discoloration in droppings, especially green or yellow colors, an abnormally thick or runny consistency, and a major increase or decrease in the number of daily droppings., Respiratory illnesses are one of the more common problems in lovebirds, so you need to watch their breathing carefully when you check for signs of illness. Difficulty breathing, breathing through an open beak, wheezing, trouble breathing while flying, and sneezing could all indicate respiratory problems.Difficulty breathing is a critical symptom in most birds. If you notice any respiratory symptoms contact your avian vet immediately or take your lovebird to your closest animal hospital.
 If you notice any burns, bite wounds, bleeding, vomiting, seizures, rapid weight loss, lumps or swelling in the body or on the feet, consistent tail bobbing, or if your bird falls off its perch, seek immediate vet attention. These are critical symptoms that indicate that your bird needs immediate medical attention.

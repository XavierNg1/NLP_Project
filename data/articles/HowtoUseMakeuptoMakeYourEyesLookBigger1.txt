 If you have puffy eyes or dark circles, concealer can hide these blemishes at least a little. It can also even out your complexion around your eyes, giving them a cleaner look. Dab it under your eyes, in the creases, and along the inside of your nose on both sides.


If you have dark under-eye circles, use concealer one shade lighter than your natural skin tone.
You can also use special foundation meant for use around the eyes; it serves the dual purpose of covering blemishes and holding your eye makeup in place.;
, Eyeliner is the key to making your eyes pop, since it creates a frame that helps them stand out from the rest of your face. Draw a very thin line just under your bottom lash line. Draw a second line above the upper lash line. If done very lightly, the eyeliner will look like it is part your lower lash line and define your eyes, making them look bigger and whiter.


For a natural look, choose a shade of brown or charcoal, rather than black.
Applying white eyeliner to the inside of your eyelid will also cause your eyes to look bigger. Carefully draw a line on the inside of your lash line above and below your eyes.
 Using a color that matches your skin tone, brush the shadow lightly on your upper lid. Blend it thoroughly and carefully to look more natural. Apply white eyeshadow to the corners of your eyes and right below the brow to brighten up the eye area.
 You want to choose a mascara that offers clean, separated lashes so they don't look chunky or clumpy. Start at the roots and lightly brush upwards. If you don't like the way mascara looks on you, try a clear mascara. It subtly defines and lengthens your lashes without attracting too much attention.

 In type 1, the body's immune system destroys the cells that produce insulin. This usually causes rapid and severe symptoms, appearing within days or weeks.Type 1 is rarer than type 2, and only accounts for 10% of all diabetes cases.Type 1 diabetes usually occurs in children or teens, but can occur in adults as well. The cause is unknown, but it is more likely to occur after a viral infection (such as the flu or mumps), or in people with a family history of autoimmune diseases.In contrast, type 2 diabetes progresses much more slowly, sometimes over the course of years.
 Severe and sudden weight loss are symptoms more often associated with type 1 diabetes. Without insulin, your body cannot process the glucose in your bloodstream for energy. When the glucose reaches high levels (hyperglycemia), your body can start to break down fat and muscle tissue for energy instead. The result is rapid weight loss, accompanied by extreme fatigue. This condition is known as diabetic ketoacidosis., When type 1 diabetes isn't treated quickly, it can be acute and deadly. Contact a doctor if you experience signs of hyperglycemia (high blood glucose), especially if you show other symptoms of possible diabetes or have a family history of diabetes:Early signs of hyperglycemia (schedule a doctor's visit soon): increased urination, thirst, blurred vision, fatigue, or headache
Later signs (seek immediate attention): trouble breathing, vomiting, weakness, confusion, abdominal pain, fruity-smelling breath.
Once you are diagnosed and receiving treatment, your doctor can explain how to treat hyperglycemia with insulin, and how to avoid severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar caused by overcorrecting).

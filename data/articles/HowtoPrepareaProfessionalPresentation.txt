Make it clear.
Don’t let the technology dominate the presentation. You want the audience to remember the quality of your research, not your PowerPoint wizardry.;
,
Who is your audience?
What are they interested in hearing?
How familiar are they, with your topic? Do they expect data or concepts?

, Don’t try to cover everything.
 We must think on ::


What will you cover, what can be eliminated?
How much detail do you need? (Remember, your time and your audience’s attention are limited. For any part of your presentation, ask yourself “So what?”)

,
How much time will you be given?
What time of day is your talk?
Carefully consider if you will depend on anyone else for producing your presentation—allow plenty of lead time.

Consider all equipment you will need

Internet connection
Computer
Microphone
Software

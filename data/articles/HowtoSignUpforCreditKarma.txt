 Open your favorite browser, type http://www.creditkarma.com in the address bar, and hit the Enter button.;
, Once the Credit Karma main page is loaded on your screen, scroll down towards the bottom of the page where there is a blue link that says “Sign up now for free.” Click on the link to load the Sign Up page.
 Type the email address you want to use for your account into the text field that opens up. Think of a strong password and enter it into the first password box, and confirm it in the second one for good measure.
 Click on the drop-down menu to display a list of questions, and select the one you want to use to secure your account. In the text box below it, click and write the secret answer to your secret question.
 Into the appropriate boxes, enter your full name, your address complete with ZIP code, and your date of birth. No need to type the name of your state; just select it from the drop-down menu.


The same thing applies to your birthday.
 Notice that the first five numbers are hidden from view, with only the last four displayed on your screen after you have enter them. Once you’re done, click on the blue “Next step” button to load the final page.
 On the last page is a series of multiple-choice questions ranging from the places you’ve lived in to the cars you own. Go down through the list, checking off all of the correct answers.
 Once you do, your Credit Karma account is now created and ready for your use!

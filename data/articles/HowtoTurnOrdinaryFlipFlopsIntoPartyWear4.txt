 Alternatively, choose a pretty rainbow colored ribbon that draws in many different colors.


Choose enough ribbon to wrap around the straps; err on more rather than less.
 Wrap the length around the straps to check that you have enough. Then unwrap in preparation for adding it permanently.
 Carefully and evenly, start to wrap the ribbon around the flip flop, dabbing a little glue behind every second or third wrap to ensure that the ribbon stays in place neatly. You have two choices––either wrap the entire way around as one length, or stop at the toe post and wrap each strap separately. Do whatever is easiest or looks best with the ribbon you're using.
 This step is optional but can complete the look. Use a large ribbon bow glued or tied in place. Use the same ribbon that you wrapped the straps with for consistency, and be sure to tie it on tightly.


Alternatively, use a costume gem, fabric flower or other embellishment in place of the bow and glue in place.
Some small shoe bows might make a handy alternative to making a ribbon bow; just make sure that it complements the ribbon used along the flip flop straps.

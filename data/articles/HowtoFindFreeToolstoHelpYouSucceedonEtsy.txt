 If you want to take your product, shop, or store to the next level, it's imperative that you network outside of Etsy to drive visitors to your Etsy shop. It seems like Etsy has acknowledged this by adding "Tweet" and "Facebook" share buttons on the listings, shops and treasuries. Make sure to use them to network your products. If you need help with this, search the web for how to set up a Facebook Fan Page, or how to use Twitter.;
, Start a blog if you don't have one already. Your blog should talk about new products you may be listing. Blogs are free to have, and by adding relevant content and good keywords this will help your products be found. Submit your blog to directories and write interesting content. Remember each post you send into cyberspace, will only help attract readers. If they find your blog they will find your shop! Search the web for blog tips to engage readers.
 Those who have learned the tips and tricks will be your best asset.

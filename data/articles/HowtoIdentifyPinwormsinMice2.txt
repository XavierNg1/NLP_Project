 The best way to positively identify pinworms in your mouse is to take them to the vet. Your doctor can perform different tests to determine if your mouse is infected. They may start by doing a tape test around the anus to check for egg deposits.One type of pinworm does not make egg deposits around the anus, so if that turns up negative, your doctor will perform a different test. They may do a fecal smear or flotation to identify the pinworms.
 Pinworms can be easily treated in mice. Your doctor will give the mouse a treatment of feed containing fendendazole. You can also find it in pet stores. You give the feed to the mouse for a week, then stop for a week, until the pinworms are gone or your vet tells you to stop treatment.The vet may also suggest a treatment using ivermectin, which can be given to the mouse topically or through their drinking water., If your mouse has pinworms, you should clean their cage and living areas. This includes the air in the room and surfaces beyond the cage since pinworms can float in the air from fecal pellets.Many disinfectants won’t kill pinworms. Ask your vet for the best cleaning supplies to disinfect your mouse’s living area.
Pinworms can be killed by high temperatures. Consider using hot water or other sources of heat to kill any lingering worms or eggs.

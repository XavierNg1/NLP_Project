 It may sound obvious but it’s really important to select the right shrub. Unfortunately picking the right plants for your garden is a bit like picking the right clothes to wear. You can’t always get the ones you like the look of—they have to suit your size and the weather you’re in. When picking a shrub, consider:


The amount of sun or shade.
Water levels.
Shelter.
Soil type (including drainage and pH level).
It’s also important to consider how much maintenance you want in terms of garden chores such as pruning and watering. Some shrubs need more care than others if they are to to look their best.;
, It’s a good idea to understand the pH (acidity or alkalinity) of your soil before you choose shrubs for the garden. You can get a soil testing kit to do this. Acid-loving or ericaceous shrubs (such as azaleas) will favor a pH range of 4-6, and ideally pH 5-5.5.


If your soil is more acid than that, don’t despair—you can incorporate some ericaceous compost to correct this.
 Some shrubs (such as some varieties of Spirea) grow to the height of small trees. If you don’t want to be a slave to your pruning duties, consider shrubs that will grow to an appropriate size for the available space.


Also consider how much the shrub will block the light to other plants nearby.
 Some plants (such as Japanese rose) may spread everywhere unless you are attentive to removing the suckers as they form.

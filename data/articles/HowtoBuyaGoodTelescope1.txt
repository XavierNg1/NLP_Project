 Refractor telescopes are considered the best model when compared to telescopes with similar attributes (aperture, focal length, etc.). They are the best type of telescope to use to view planets or the moon. The design consists of a convex lens at one end of a sealed tube and an eyepiece at the other end. Refractors are also the most expensive kind of telescope., The reflector design is cheaper than the refractor telescope, but the images are less clear. This telescope might be a good purchase for a beginner. The reflector utilizes a set of concave mirrors in place of a lens. The primary mirror gathers light and sends it to the secondary mirror. The secondary mirror shoots the light out the side of the telescope to the eye piece., Compact telescopes combine both designs to create a solid middle choice. They are generally somewhere between the refractor and reflector in price and quality. The compact telescopes also use a technique of “folding” the light so that they can be made much shorter than other telescopes and keep the same focal length.Focal length is the distance between the primary lens and your eye.
 The best telescope to buy is the one that fits your needs most effectively. Locate a local astronomy club or observatory and ask to try out different telescopes. This way, you discover what you like before you buy your own telescope, and you make some contacts in the local astronomy arena.

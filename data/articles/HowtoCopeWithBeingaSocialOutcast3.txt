 If you are being bullied or are feeling unhappy in any way because you feel like a social outcast, tell an adult whom you trust. It will help you to talk about your feelings, and the adult may also know how to help you by helping you talk through your feelings and/or by stopping the bullying.,, If you are depressed, anxious, struggling in school, have difficulty sleeping, are consistently sad or unhappy, or especially if you feel like harming yourself or others, speak to an adult and seek counseling/psychological therapy right away. Dealing with depression and bullying are not things that you should handle by yourself.

  A menstrual cup being boiled.

Boil your menstrual cup either in a pot or in the microwave. (Consult the directions that came with your cup for how long you should boil it.) Make sure the cup stays floating at the top of the pot the whole time, because the bottom will be hot enough to burn or melt your cup. After boiling your cup, let it cool, dry with a paper towel or toilet paper, and store your cup.
# Put 1 Tbsp of baking soda into a pot of near-boiling water. Put your cup in, making sure it's covered with the water, but not completely on the bottom of the pot. Let sit for 15 minutes, then add 1/2 Tbsp more baking soda, trying to dump it in on/in the cup if you can. The baking soda will get rid of any odors. Roll the cup over, boil for 5-10 more minutes, then remove from water. Let it cool and dry on a paper towel.

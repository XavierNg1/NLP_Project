 Remember that, just like other people, some deaf people are better readers and writers than others. Start off using simple language and short sentences. If the deaf person is using more complex language, you can follow their cue and do the same. , The deaf person will have lots of trouble understanding you if they can’t read your handwriting. If you know you have bad handwriting, try slowing down. It might take longer, but it won’t take as long as it would to rewrite the same sentence multiple times because the deaf person can’t read what you wrote.
 You may find it useful to show your deaf companion any available images or documents in order to clarify your meaning. You might also point to objects or people in your environment; pointing is not considered rude in the deaf community. , You can use a smart phone or computer to Google search images that might help clarify what you want to say. You can also use instant messaging, email, or text messaging to communicate through writing.

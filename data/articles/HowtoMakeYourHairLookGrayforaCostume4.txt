 Purchase gray or silver hair chalk at a beauty supply store and dip the tip of the hair chalk in water. Use a spray bottle filled with water to spray and dampen your hair.Hair chalk is very strongly pigmented, much more so than sidewalk chalk or even artist pastel chalk.
 Brush your hair to separate all the strands, then separate a strand of your hair and hold it at the tips away from your face., Starting at the roots of your hair, rub the dampened tip of the hair chalk downward to coat and color the section of your hair., Repeat the process of holding out a section of hair and coloring it with the gray hair chalk on the rest of your hair. You may need to re-dampen the tip of the chalk several times if you have long hair., Once you finish coating your head, wait for about one minute and then blow-dry your hair to set the color into your hair for the day. If you want the color to last a few days, use a hair straightener or curler on the gray parts of your hair to encourage the color to last longer., Since hair chalk has the tendency to rub off on your clothes without using hairspray, spritz your hair all over with hairspray to make sure it doesnâ€™t rub off.Hair chalk should come out in one to two shampoos.

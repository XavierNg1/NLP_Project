 Do you want to choose a big colourful one, or a small non-colourful one? You can choose any betta you'd like to draw, including a dull one. You can also try drawing your own betta if you have one.;
, Make sure it is not too rounded. Do the same at the other end where its tail will be, but a bit pointier.
 Leave a point at the end of the fin pointing down. Don't draw the triangle straight down though.
,, This will look similar to the bottom fins too, except the top one is at the top of the betta. Make it like hair styled, but not like the curly hair, etc. Draw it a bit longer.
 Don't outline guidelines that go directly inside the betta's body.
 Try not to make the pen's ink scrape off.
 If you'd like, add a few detailed lines to the betta's fins and tail.

Look where you live and determine what weather you will have. This can influence the time lapse if it is cloudy and/or raining.
 Some cameras have a waterproof casing which allows it to be in rain and snow. If you don't have this, you might want to buy a casing, or improvise in making a cover for it yourself.
 Leaving your camera out for a nighttime time lapse can result in it powering off because your battery drained during your recording.
 Depending on the speed of the clouds, stars and moon, you will have to judge what you think is the best time for your time lapse. Start out at something like 10 seconds, but that's mainly for the moon. If you want to get a good star time lapse, you might want to put that at less, unless you want star trails, which will take longer.
 If you're full, consider moving some files to the computer and deleting the ones on the camera

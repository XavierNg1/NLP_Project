It can also help solidify or change your decision about a career path.You can also take high school electives related to your intended major whenever possible.
 Take an afternoon to sit down with a current college student and talk with them about their experience. Ask them questions about when they chose their major, what their coursework is like, and how they managed stress while preparing for college.
 If you have an interest in a particular career path, ask a professional in that field if you can shadow them at work for a day. This will give you an idea of their day-to-day job. Watching a professional in action can help you stress less about whether your career choice is the right one for you.Talk to your parents about identifying friends or family members with a career in a field that interests you.

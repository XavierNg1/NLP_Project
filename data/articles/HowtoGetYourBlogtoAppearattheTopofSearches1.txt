 Your primary goal should be to produce interesting, high-quality content for your intended readers. According to Google, interesting, well-curated blogs will naturally move up the search result rankings.Produce content that attracts visitors and inspires them to share your blog with their friends.;
, Search engine "spiders" cannot “see” your site—they are only capable of reading your content and the blog’s code. Furthermore, these spiders only “read” approximately the first third of each page before moving on to the next page. You can improve the bot’s ability to crawl and index your site by:


Providing more text (i.e. crawlable content).
Placing the content as close to the top of the page as possible.As you produce more crawlable and indexable information, you will rise in the search results.
 Google encourages bloggers to pepper their content with key phrases and words that a member of your target audience may use in a search. When someone searches, the search engine shows results for sites that include the same words and/or phrases.


Balance is the key. Be careful not to overuse these key words and phrases.
These keywords and phrases should also appear in your HTML title tags, meta “description” tags, anchor text, alt text, headings, and URLS.

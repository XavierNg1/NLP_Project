 While this approach maybe isn't as proactive as you'd like, it may be your only option if local laws aren't on your side. You may just need to close your curtains when you notice the exhibitionism is happening, and look away when you're outside. As an added bonus, if your neighbor gets a thrill out of you looking, maybe they'll be less thrilled if nobody is watching., Another option is to go inside when you notice the person is exposing themselves while you're outdoors. This step is especially effective if you're outside with your kids. You can keep them from seeing what's going on next door by removing them from the area.
 Another option is to build a fence tall enough so that you can't see your neighbor's house. Of course, that's more difficult if your neighbor has a two-story house, but it can be effective for one-story houses. Also, a high fence around your backyard can keep your kids from seeing what's going on nearby.
 If your kids are exposed to your neighbor, you need to have a talk with them. Explain that what the person is doing is seen as something that should be kept private, and it's best not to look, as that will only encourage the person more.You could say, "That person has a problem. They are showing something publicly that we know should be kept private. We can't change what that person is doing, but we can control how we react. The best reaction is to ignore the person and try not to look."

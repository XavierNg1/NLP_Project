 To give your lip scrub flavor, you can use any type and flavor of lip balm that you like. Twist the lip balm up in the tube, and use a butter knife to carefully shave off a piece of the balm that’s approximately 2- to 3-inches (20 to 30 mm) thick. Place it in a small bowl.Lip balms are available in a wide range of flavors, including fruit, such as strawberry and cherry, and even candy, such as Skittles or Starburst. Choose your favorite for the lip scrub.
While most lip balms are transparent when they go on the lips, they’re often colored in the tube. If you use a colored balm, you’ll wind up with a colored scrub. For example, strawberry lip balm is often pink so you’ll wind up a pink lip scrub. You may need to add more than one piece of lip balm to give the scrub a vibrant color, though.
Using additional pieces of lip balm will also intensify the flavor of the lip scrub.;
, With the lip balm in the bowl, mix in 1 part petroleum jelly and 2 parts sugar. Use a spoon to stir all of the ingredients together until you wind up with a thick, grainy paste.You can make as large or as small a batch of lip scrub as you’d like. Adjust the amount of lip balm, petroleum jelly, and sugar accordingly.
You don’t necessarily need to worry about exact measurements with the scrub recipe. If you prefer a grainy, textured scrub, add more sugar. If you prefer a smoother scrub, add more petroleum jelly.
It’s a good idea to rub a little of the scrub on your lips after you’ve mixed it. If you want it to have more flavor, stir in more of the lip balm.
 Once you’re satisfied with the texture and flavor of the scrub, use a spoon to carefully transfer it to a small plastic jar or container that has a lid. To use the scrub, massage a small amount over your lips for 30 to 60 seconds, and wipe it off with a damp wash cloth.When you’re putting the scrub in the storage container, pack it down with your finger so you can easily close the lid.

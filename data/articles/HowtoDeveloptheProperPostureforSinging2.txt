 In a circle, rotate your shoulders forward, up, and then back. Keep your shoulders in the back position. Relax them so that they are slanted down., When your shoulders are slightly back, you will find that your chest naturally rises. Holding your chest high will create more room for your diaphragm to expand. Do not strain or puff out your chest., When you are breathing in, your core should be relaxed in order to expand to accommodate the air that you are taking into your body. Your core will tighten as you slowly release this air to project your voice.


Test your breath ability by placing your hand on your belly. Take a deep breath in. Focus on breathing into your hand by expanding your belly. Do not raise your shoulders when you breathe.
 Your arms should be to each side of your body. Keep them relaxed and not rigid. Your hands should be slightly away from your body. Remember to also relax your hands and your fingers.Wiggle your fingers and wrists when you feel like you are too stiff.

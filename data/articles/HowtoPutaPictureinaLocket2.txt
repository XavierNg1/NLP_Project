 If you work in a place that has a copy machine, you're in luck. Otherwise take it to a store where you can make a copy using a machine.


This method is best used for a locket that lies flat when it is open. If your locket's hinge won't allow it to lie flat, you won't be able to make a good copy.
If you have a scanner and printer at home, that will work just as well.
 Make sure it is lying flat on the surface. The inside of the locket should be facing down.
 Be sure the copy machine settings are such that the copy is true to size (100 percent), rather than coming out smaller or larger than the actual locket.


If you're using a scanner, scan the locket, open the image file on your computer, then print out the image. Make sure your scanner and printer settings allow you to print an image of the locket that's true to size (100 percent).
 You should be able to see a faint outline of the photo recess inside the locket. Use a scissors or craft knife to carefully cut it out. You'll use this template to cut your photo down to the right size.
 Position it so that the face or image you want to store in your locket is contained within the borders of the template. Use a pencil to lightly trace around the template onto the photo.
 Use a scissors or a craft knife to neatly cut the photo to the exact size of your template.
 Place a dab of glue on the back of the photo. Gently insert it into the locket. Press it lightly to ensure it stays in place.
 Once dried, the locket is ready to wear.

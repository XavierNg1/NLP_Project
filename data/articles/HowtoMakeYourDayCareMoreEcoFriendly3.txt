 Use pesticides only when necessary and no other options are available.


Clean up any food or drink spills or crumbs as soon as they occur so they do not attract pests.[
Fill in cracks and holes with expandable foam or caulking to prevent pests from entering through them.
Use a garbage can with a lid and take the trash out daily.
Store food in sealed containers. Pests need food and water. Do not leave either out for their taking.

 It's important to show up with clean, well-brushed hair so you look as put-together as possible. Your hair should be dry and you should avoid any excessive hair products.


Have a fresh haircut. If your hair is too long or limp-looking, you may appear sloppy or unprofessional. Men should shave off all facial hair.
Have a subtle 'do. Men should avoid spiking their hair or gelling it in a distracting manner, and women should avoid loud hair-clips or other hair accessories and wear their hair down.
Before your interview, check your shoulders for dandruff, especially if you're wearing a dark color.
 Your employers will notice your hands as soon as you give them that first handshake, so you should have job-ready fingernails at all times. The way you take care of your nails can show your employers whether or not you pay keen attention to detail.


Check under your fingernails to avoid dirt.
Women should manicure their nails. They can be clear or a subtle shade of pink, but loud colors should be avoided.
Men should trim their nails so they have nice, even edges.

 But Google has a bug so that "nineteen ninety-five" will be returned by Google such as only the four numerals "1995", not spelled-out in words?! , So, the number is spelled out by Google,"nineteen and ninety-five" returns "Dix-neuf et quatre-vingt quinze" .
So then you can just leave out the "et" ("and"), in the French numbers. Odd trick, but it is necessary, unless Google fixes that bug., Repeat after it in your mind some -- and also in your audible voicing, and pay attention to how you sound.




Try facing very closely into/an inside corner (stand with you face about 4 inches away from the inside of a corner) to hear your voicing, pronunciation very clearly.

Cup a hand behind an ear to hear yourself much more clearly than ordinary speech.

Record you voicing while practicing, and compare it to the audio lesson. Play it back again to check it over and over, if practical.

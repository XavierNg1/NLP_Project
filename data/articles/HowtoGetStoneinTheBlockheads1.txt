 Stone is not found in dirt; it is flint that grey-ish flecks in the dirt block.;
, There are two ways to dig it:


Dig by hand. This will take a lot of time and consume a lot of energy.
Dig with a tool. Use a flint pickaxe. This will speed up the digging and preserve your Blockhead's energy.
 This will happen when the status bar is completed. It will transform into a stone block in your inventory (a grey block).

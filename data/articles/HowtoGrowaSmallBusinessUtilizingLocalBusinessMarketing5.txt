 Organic SEO is the natural promotion of your website through resources that the search engines find valuable. Organic listings in the search engines are highly trusted and often visited by potential clients.
 Local listings in the search engines are what you see next to those "map bubbles" with the A, B, C, D, etc.
 Pay per click listings or as the industry refers to it as, CPC listings. These search engine results are paid listings and appear before and to the side of the organic search results.

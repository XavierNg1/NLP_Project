Place a sticky note sideways – like a kite shape – at the top center, above where your item will hang.You may want to hang a picture 60 inches (152 cm) above the floor, or with its bottom edge six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm) up from a piece of furniture.
For a group of items, cut paper patterns of their shapes. Use low-adhesive tape to place the papers on the wall and decide where you want the items to hang. Then place the corner of a sticky note at the top center of each paper, so that the bottom corner is your reference point.

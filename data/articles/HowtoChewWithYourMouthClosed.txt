 Close your mouth and chew with your back teeth. Use one or two sticks of gum for this practice. Remember to breathe through your nose, not through your mouth.;
, Put a little bit of the food into your mouth. Now close your mouth, chewing with only your back teeth. Chew slowly; this helps you keep your mouth closed.
 This is no reason to open your mouth. Still chew with it closed.
 Follow the same principle: small portions at first, then slowly work your way up. Chew slowly.
 While these may make noise, it is no excuse to open your mouth while chewing.

 Remove all of your personal information by reformatting your hard drive, transferring your files to an external hard drive or USB drive and then deleting them, or having your hard drive overwritten.Transferring and deleting your files is the easiest way to wipe your hard drive, and requires no outside help. It is not the most secure method of removal.
Reformatting your hard drive can be done by going into your computer’s settings and selecting a “wipe” or “format” option for your hard drive.
Overwriting your hard drive is typically done by a computer professional for a fee. If your computer has a lot of personal or financial information, this may be the safest option.
 Once you’ve finished removing your information to the best of your ability, remove the bottom panel of your computer to expose the computer’s inner workings. Take your hard drive out, including the metal case typically surrounding the disc and circuit boards.Most computers are held together with small screws. Remove these screws, and separate the bottom panel from your computer.
To locate your hard drive, look for what appears to be a small, circular disk, much like a CD.
 Although the drive has been wiped, you want to be sure nothing remains and is able to be accessed. Using a drill bit of any size, drill a hole through the hard drive in at least one area. For added security, you can drill multiple holes in your hard drive, depending on how large the drive itself is., Place all of the components of your hard drive into a box and dispose of them according to your city codes. If you are not sure what your city codes are, you can contact a local electronics store and ask how to properly dispose of everything.

 It doesn't have to be perfectly shaped; this is just the initial sketch. Draw a“teardrop” shape because the head will cover it--just end where the neck of the cat is.;
, Make two oval shapes in the right side of the “teardrop” body shape (follow the tutorial's illustration if you have problems positioning the legs). These will be the two front legs. Then draw two circles, one next to the left front leg and the other between the two front legs.


The only visible parts of the back two legs will be the paws, which is why we’re only putting circles there and not full-on ovals.
 Make a curved shape for the tail, connecting at the lower left end part of the “teardrop” body. Draw circles around the end of the oval front legs for the paws (only two for the front legs)

, Make guidelines, one vertical for positioning the nose and mouth, and one horizontal for positioning the eyes. Then sketch large, roundish eyes with a smaller circle for the iris, a small, triangular nose and a wide mouth. With this step you are finished sketching.


Keep in mind that anime features are exaggerated compared to real ones, so all expressive elements (i.e. mouth and eyes) should be bigger/more emotionally charged than usual.
 Erase the sketch lines. Finish the eyes by adding a black circle inside each iris circle (this is the pupil) and two or three smaller white circles depicting the highlights of the eyes. Add more details like whiskers, small fangs, fine lines inside the ears (for ear fluff) and small “toes” for the paws.
 Put patterns into its fur, like spots or stripes, and add even more features if you want.


For this part you can let your imagination run wild, or you can use the reference if you're not feeling too creative.

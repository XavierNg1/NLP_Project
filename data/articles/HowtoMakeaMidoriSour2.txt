 In a tall, thin glass, mix 1 ounce (30 ml) of melon liqueur, 1 ounce (30 ml) of vodka, ½ ounce (15 ml) of lemon juice, and ½ ounce (15 ml) of lime juice. Use a cocktail stirrer or long spoon to mix the ingredients together well.A Collins glass that holds approximately 12 ounces (355 ml) is a good option for the cocktail.
You can also mix the ingredients in a cocktail shaker if you prefer.
For the best tasting Midori sour, use freshly squeezed lemon and lime juice.
While Midori is the classic melon liqueur, any brand will do for the cocktail.
 After you’ve mixed all of the ingredients, put a handful or so of ice into the mixture to chill it. Stir the cocktail with the cocktail stirrer or spoon again to ensure that the ice is evenly distributed.If you’ve mixed the cocktail in a shaker, fill the glass with ice first and then pour the drink over it.
 Once the ice is added to the glass, top off the cocktail with a splash of soda water. Next, float a maraschino cherry in the drink and serve.When it comes to soda water, plain seltzer or club soda will work.
You can also add an orange slice to the drink for garnish if you like.

 Head lice move quickly and avoid light, so a fine-toothed comb will be handy in a thorough examination.


You can check for lice with both dry or wet hair. If you're checking with wet hair, wash and condition your hair before going over you hair with a comb.
In order to check your hair with a fine-toothed comb, use these steps:
Use an ordinary brush to detangle hair
Switch to the fine-toothed comb and start combing at the front middle of the scalp
Comb the hair from the roots to the ends, examining the comb after each stroke
Do this over your entire head


People with thicker hair may want to look for lice after washing their hair. In this case, using conditioner, or one tablespoon of olive oil, may make running the nit comb through your hair easier.;
, Nits don't move, so they'll be easier to spot. Pay careful attention to the areas behind the ears and near the base of the neck when checking for nits.
 Dandruff and dirt can sometimes be mistaken for head lice.
 You can treat them in the following way:


Try a non-prescription lotion or shampoo. Their main ingredient is often 1% permethrin. Apply the lotion of shampoo as directed, waiting 8 to 12 hours and then checking for active lice again.
Try a prescription strength lotion or shampoo. Malathion 0.5% may be prescribed in cases where non-prescription lotions or shampoos do not have the desired efficacy. It is supposed to be left in the hair for a period of 12 hours.
Make sure the lice don't spread:
Wash all clothing and bedding in hot water immediately
Remove any lice and eggs you comb out of the person's hair
Do not share clothing, especially articles like hats that are worn on the head

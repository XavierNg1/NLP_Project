10 ounces Coconut Rum
6 ounces Blue Curacao Liqueur
12 ounces Sweet-and-Sour Mix
20 ounces Pineapple Juice
32 ounces Lemon-Lime Soda
Blue food coloring
1 6 ounce box of Nerds® candy
12 to 18 Swedish Fish candies
1 Fresh Lemon
1 Fresh Lime
1 Fresh Orange
Ice
3 small Fishbowls
9 Drinking Straws;
, Find a large pitcher or container. Pour the Vodka, Coconut Rum, Blue Curacao Liqueur, Sweet-and-Sour Mix, Pineapple Juice, and Lemon-Lime soda into the pitcher or container. Stir with a spoon. Cover the pitcher or container tightly and keep it in the fridge until you’re ready to serve the drink., Thoroughly wash and dry the 3 fishbowls. Divide the Nerds® candy evenly between the 3 fishbowls. The Nerds® should cover the bottom of the fishbowl. Fill the fishbowl with ice. Wedge 4 to 6 Swedish fish candies between the ice and the glass—the ice will hold the fish in place., Grab the pitcher or container out the of the fridge. Uncover and add the blue food coloring to the mix. Add a few drops at a time and stir until the liquid becomes the perfect shade of ocean blue. Pour or ladle the mixture into the 3 fish bowls. Try to divide the mixture between the 3 fishbowls as evenly as possible., Wash the lemon, lime, and orange before thinly slicing the fruit. Add 2 to 3 slices of each fruit to the top of each fishbowl. Top each drink off with Lemon-Lime soda. Put 3 straws into each fishbowl and serve the drinks to your guests.

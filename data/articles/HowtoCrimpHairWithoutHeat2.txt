 If you have not already, shampoo and condition your hair. Let it air dry partway before continuing; it will be easier to braid. Make sure that your hair is completely tangle-free. Run a wide-toothed comb through it, if necessary.
 This will help your hair hold the crimp better, especially if your hair is very straight or does not hold a curl well. If you do this, you will need to do it for each layer of hair that you work with.
 The more sections you have, the tighter crimp you will get. If you want, you can keep these sections separated temporarily with a hairclip, a claw clip, or even some hair ties. Be sure to take these out before you are braiding that section.


For thinner hair, try 3 to 5 sections.
For thicker hair, try 3 to 10 sections.
 Try to keep the braids as tight as possible. A regular braid will result in straighter hair at top, and crimped hair at the bottom. A French braid will result in an all-over crimp.


Be sure to braid your hair all the way to the ends. Tie the braid off with a hair tie about Â½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) from the ends. Loop the tail end of the braid into the hair elastic. This will help create that all-over crimped look, and prevent any straight ends.
 The hairspray will help your hair keep the crimp longer.
 This can take up to four hours, or even longer, depending on the thickness of your hair. If you are going to sleep with the braids in, try wrapping your hair with a head scarf or sleeping on a satin pillowcase. This will help prevent friction and frizz.
 If you can't tell if your hair is dry, press your fingers into one of the braids. If the hair inside the braid feels dry, then you can undo the braids. If the hair feels damp, let your hair dry longer.
 Brushing crimped hair will make it turn poofy. If the crimps aren't fluffy enough for you, soften them up by gently running your fingers through them.

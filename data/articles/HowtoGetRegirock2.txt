 In order to access Regirock, you will need to beat the main game. This will open up the Clay Tunnel, which can be reached from Driftveil City.
 You will most likely have to fight quite a bit to get to the back, so be sure to have a strong party and plenty of health items. Repel will help prevent you from getting attacked by wild Pokémon.
 At the back of the cave, there will be a large door with a symbol on the ground in front of it. Stand in the center of the symbol.


Walk down 6 steps.
Walk to the right 9 steps.
Press the A button. A message will appear stating that you’re standing on a switch. Press A again to trigger the switch.
 Go through the door and go to the back of the room. There will be a Regirock statue in the center of a small room. Talk to it to start the Regirock battle.


Save before starting the battle.
 Regirock is level 65, so you’ll want to make sure your party is ready for the challenge. Get it down to around 5% health, and then start throwing Poke Balls at it. You’ll have decent luck With Dusk Balls or Great Balls. If you have a Master Ball, you can throw it immediately without bothering to fight.

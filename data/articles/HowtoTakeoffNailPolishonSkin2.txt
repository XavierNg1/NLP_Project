 Wet nail polish is easier to remove while it is wet. The oils in the baby wipe will also help dissolve the nail polish, making it even easier to remove. It is ideal for young children and sensitive areas, such as the face.
 Dampen the corner of a soft towel with some oil, and gently rub the affected area. The oil should help dissolve the nail polish, and make it come off. Remove any oily residue with some warm water and gentle soap.The oil will also help nourish and soften the skin.

Do not use non-acetone nail polish remover on the face.
Dampen a cotton ball with some non-acetone nail polish remover and rub the affected area until the polish comes off. Rinse the area with some soap and warm water. Non-acetone nail polish remover is gentler than regular nail polish remover, but it may still leave the skin feeling dry. If this happens, try rubbing some hand lotion or cream over the area once you are done.
 Sometimes, soaking in water and a little bit of scrubbing with soap and a wash cloth may be all that's needed to loosen up dried nail polish. Be sure to use warm water, soap, and a mildly-abrasive washcloth or sponge. Gently scrub the area until the nail polish peels off. The warm water should also help it come off. Plan on the bath taking 15 to 20 minutes for best results.
 The nail polish will eventually wear off after a few days. Throughout the day, the skin will come in contact with clothing, toys, pillows, and towels. All of this will create friction, which will be enough to help peel the polish off. Young children may also learn from this experience, and not paint his or her face with nail polish again.

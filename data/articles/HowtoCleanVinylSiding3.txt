 Pour a few tablespoons of dishwashing liquid in the bucket, until the water is soapy. Use a professional-grade cleaner, such as Vinyl Renu, if the siding surface shows excessive signs of oxidation. Soapy water may not be adequate to rub the vinyl siding clean on it's own. Other cleaning mixtures include:


2/3s water, and 1/3 white vinegar makes a gentle, natural, and safe cleaner.
For tougher jobs, 2/3 cup powdered detergent, 1/3 cup powdered household cleaner (TSP), and around a quart of bleach with a gallon of water. (Note -- not safe if you have animals!)
Natural cleaners like Simple Green, or oxygen bleach, can fight tough stains without damaging your lawn and landscaping., The best way to clean siding is by hand -- but you won't be able to reach without an extending pole. They are available at hardware stores, such as Home Depot in the U.S. You can also find a pole online on popular retail websites, such as Amazon. A typical pole costs less than US $50.
 The brush will be attached to your extending pole. To make sure the sizes match, you may prefer to buy the pole and the handle together.


Don't use the rough or course brushes -- you want something soft to prevent scratching.
 Wash what you can reach from the starting point, re-dipping your brush whenever it starts to dry. The brush should be dripping wet at all times. Don't worry about the streaks yet -- this is why you work from the bottom up -- it keeps everything wet for the eventual rinse off.For serious cleanings, you can load a pressure washer with your soap mixture first, spraying the whole house down before attacking with the brush.
 This is the golden rule of cleaning vinyl -- brush from the bottom up, rinse from the top down. This ensures that the water carries all of your dirt down and away, instead of letting it dry back onto the siding., Once you have washed all the areas you need to, clean your equipment, put them away, and leave your house to dry on its own.

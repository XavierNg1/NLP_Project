 Sometimes, for whatever reason, your browser's popup detection will fail and a few ads will get through. Most of the time, fixing this is simply a matter of turning on your browser's popup blocker option. Sometimes, however, for simple peace of mind or for heavy-duty security, you'll want to buy or download software to get the job done.
 Although most good popup blocker software isn't free, there are a few good popup blockers that are fully-loaded yet don't cost a dime. If you're hawkish about internet security, or constantly bombarded with ads, you may want to consider paying for software. With paid software, you'll usually get:


Easy installation and ready usability
All the bells and whistles, with most centering on detecting and removing adware and spyware
Help and support, with good customer service
Added security features, aside from just the bells and whistles

, Each user and computer's individual needs should ultimately dictate which software they choose. Still, here are some popular software options that many people choose to use:


Free software:
AdFender
Smart Popup Blocker
Popup Free
Ad Arrest Popup Killer


Paid software:
Super Ad Blocker
Popup Ad Smasher
AdsGone Popup Killer
Popup Purger Pro



, After installation, tinker with the settings to optimize the software for your individual needs. If you want to add exceptions to your software, do this now. Otherwise, try surfing onto a popup-prone website and see the magic in action.

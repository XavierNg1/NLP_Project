 There will be some areas where Pokémon appear that aren't intended for public access. Playing Pokémon GO in these places can lead to severe legal consequences. For this reason, avoid actively searching for Pokémon, PokéStops, and gyms at:


Police stations
Airports
Schools grounds that are not your own
Private residences and yards
Courthouses
Office spaces

, Predatory Pokémon GO players may take advantage of players in vulnerable environments. You will be better-equipped to avoid being a victim of scams and other malicious activity by avoiding playing Pokémon GO in highly isolated or poorly lit areas.
 This will significantly reduce your vulnerability to predatory Pokémon GO players. Be sure to travel in groups when heading to unfamiliar areas.
 Pokémon GO drains phone battery very quickly. When you're out in the world, running out of battery can cause players to get lost or stranded far from home. Bringing a battery pack can significantly reduce this risk by extending your phone's ability to run the game for longer. Other steps to extend your battery life include:


Turning off the Augmented Reality setting. This can be done in the settings of the Pokémon GO app.
Use your phone's low battery/power saver setting, if it has one.
 Many Pokémon will be placed in natural areas such as parks, hiking trails, and by water. While this presents a great opportunity to explore the natural world, practice extreme caution when the app leads you to:


Mountainous areas
Areas with poison oak and ivy
Open bodies of water

, Maintain awareness of your physical surroundings at all times. This is especially important while crossing the street or in busy thoroughfares where inattentiveness could lead to bodily injury or put your personal belongings at risk.

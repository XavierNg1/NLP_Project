 If you’re running out of storage on your phone or computer but you have photos you don’t want to lose, upload them to the Cloud. The Cloud is an non-local form of mass storage, which means it saves files separately from your device. Most new smartphones and PCs provide users the option of uploading files to the Cloud so that they can free up space on the device itself without losing things they want to keep.On iPhones and iPads, the default cloud-storage service is called iCloud; devices that run Android and Other operating systems typically come equipped with Dropbox or Google Drive.Read up on how to sync your files to the Cloud.
 This is an old-school and more private form of alternative file storage. Place the photos you want off of your device into an email attachment and make yourself the recipient of the email. Your photos will then remain there safe and sound in your email so that you can re-download them whenever you choose. Just make sure you have enough available storage in your email to house the attachment.Most email programs offer storage of up to a few gigabytes, more than enough for the average person that doesn’t often exchange large files.
Group lots of photos into a folder in order to send them as a single large attachment rather than numerous smaller ones., Purchase an inexpensive flash drive (also known as a “thumb drive”) and connect it to a USB port on your PC. This will give you the option of opening a folder displaying the contents of the flash drive. Drag-and-drop the photos you want to save into the flash drive folder, then disconnect it from your computer. Your photos will be saved physically on the drive, which you can reconnect to download, modify or remove.Check to make sure the flash drive you’re using has enough memory to hold the pictures you want to hang on to.
Keep up with your flash drives and other external storage devices. If they happen to get lost, so do your pictures.

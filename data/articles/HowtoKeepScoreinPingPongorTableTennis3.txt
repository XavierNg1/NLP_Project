 Continue to play the game, keeping track of scores. The round will continue until one player has at least 11 or 21 points, depending on the rules you set. You need at least a 2 point lead in order to win a round, so a score of 10 to 11 or 20 to 21 will not result in you winning.
 Remember, in the event of 10 to 10 or 20 to 20 tie, the round goes into overtime. Continue to play until one player gains at least a two point lead. For example, a score of 10 to 12 could settle a tie in an overtime round.
 You play for an odd number of rounds in ping pong. The player who wins the most rounds wins the game. For example, say you're playing for 5 rounds. The winning player must win at least 3 out of 5 of the rounds.

 Get the best of both worlds by using black and holographic liner together. Start by thinly lining your upper lash-line with black. Get into spaces between lashes with an extra sharp pencil or liquid liner, then swipe a thin line along your top lid.
 Thickly line holographic liner right above the thinly lined black liner. Start lining at the beginning of the lash-line arch that's closest to your nose. As you extend the liner a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) past your lash-line thicken it to a 1⁄4 inch (0.64 cm).


Line holographic liner above the arch of your lash-line or line all the way from the corners of your eyes.
 Line the waterline of your lower lash-line, the area closest to your eyes. Use holographic liner pencil in a pastel or chrome shade to do this. Your eyes will look wider and the liner will make them pop., Don’t forget to top your look off with mascara and eyeshadow. For a dramatic look, brush a gray or charcoal shadow along your eyelid crease. Blend downwards and upwards with a sheer, white shadow. Swipe two coats of mascara on your upper and lower lashes.

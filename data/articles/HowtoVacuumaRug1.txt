 Woven rugs can either have heavy pile, thin pile, or no pile at all - itâ€™s just the density of the vertical fibers protruding from the rug. The direction that those fibers naturally lay is called the pile direction.To determine the pile direction, brush your hand along the rug. If you are brushing against the pile, you will feel resistance.


Always dust or brush woven rugs in the direction of the pile. Stroking against the pile can cause softer wools to break.;
, If you vacuum with the pile direction, the fibers will cover and protect the dirt you are trying to remove. If you vacuum against the pile direction, this can provide unnecessary wear on the rug and can cause shedding and damage.
 While vacuuming along the edges, use a hand or foot to hold down the fringe. Vacuuming the fringe can cause damage to both the vacuum and the rug.Vacuums without beater bars are best for this task because the fringe cannot get tangled inside the vacuum.

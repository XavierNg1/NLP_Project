 Colorful dish soap is less likely to freeze all the way. It is also harder to mistake colorful dish soap for something edible in the freezer. If you want your gel pack to look like a traditional gel pack, you may want to opt for blue dish soap., You can fill the bag as full as you want it with dish soap. There is no set amount. Simply fill the bag until your ice pack is as big and bulky as you want it.Keep in mind more dish soap can cause a bag to take longer to freeze. If you need your ice pack very soon, opt to use less dish soap.
 Place your bag in the refrigerator. Allow it to freeze overnight. When you take the gel pack out of the fridge, it should be semi-frozen and ready to use on sore areas of your body.

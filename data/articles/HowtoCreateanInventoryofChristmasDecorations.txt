 It's the best time because all of your decorations are out and as you pack them up to put back in storage, this should be the same time that you create your inventory.
 Use Excel, Word, or some other similar program capable of making up a table that accepts both text and images., Develop a system that works for you, so that you know how to find each item quickly. Try to find a main heading, a subheading and then the descriptive heading. For example:
Tree decorations - baubles -

24 x red baubles;
12 x green baubles;
6 x kitty cat baubles


Tree decorations - glass ornaments -

Santa x 5
Cottage x 4


Tree decorations - fabric ornaments -

Mary Claus and Santa Claus
Reindeer x 5
Patchwork gingerbread houses x 8


Tinsel - metallic -

Gold lengths x 2
Green lengths x 1
Red lengths x 10


Tinsel - bead -

Silver x 2
Blue x 1


Mantelpiece decorations - ceramic village pieces -

Lighted house x 1
Lighted skating pond x 2


Garden decorations -

Glowing reindeer x 1
Polar bear with moving parts and lights x 1



, Also note where it is stored - for example, "in the boxes under the stairs", "in the garden shed", "in Mary's old room," etc., so that you know where to lay your hands on the items quickly and easily. Make any notes of special arrangements too, such as when items are stored in separate pieces and need reassembling, or when special wrapping must be maintained for storage etc. It can also be a great way to make a note of heirloom items by noting such things as "came from Grandma May's house," circa 1897 etc., Take a photo of each item that you will be placing on the inventory. Slot this photo in next to its description so that you can quickly assess what each item is as you scroll through the document. Not only will this alert you to what you have but it can be a fantastic way of finding themes from colors to animals to angels etc. that you might wish to use on any particular year.

 For an accurate picture of your older cat's health, visit your vet for a thorough checkup. Tell them about any irregularities in your cat's health or behaviour beyond its irritability (e.g. lethargy, loss of appetite). Some medical conditions common to older cats that may cause irritability include:Degenerative joint disease (e.g. arthritis)
Inflammatory bowel disease
Constipation
Dental disease;
, Take the time to inspect and clean your cat's teeth at least once a week to maintain their oral health. Tooth pain can cause irritable behaviour in cats and make it difficult for them to eat, further compromising their health. Call your veterinarian for a dental exam immediately if you notice any of the following signs:Bad breath
Mouth sores
Swollen or bleeding gums
Redness of the gums
Drooling

, Aging cats often experience cognitive issues similar to humans, such as dementia, confusion, and loss of memory. If you identify these issues early enough, your veterinarian may be able to prescribe medication to slow down the decline in cognitive function. Signs to look for and tell your veterinarian about include:Disorientation
Irregular sleep patterns (sleeping all day and staying up all night)
Agitation or anxiety
Decreased activity
House soiling

, Your older cat might demonstrate irregular behaviour in terms of eliminating (e.g. not using its litter box, "marking its territory" with urine). Consult with your vet to determine if these behaviours are signs of a medical condition, or the result of your irritable, aging cat acting out. With age, a lapse in control of eliminating functions could be due to:Hyperthyroidism
Kidney failure
Diabetes
Mobility issues (i.e. difficulty accessing the litter box)
Confusion or memory loss

 Call any store that sells video games, game consoles and accessories to game systems.;
, Ask , "I was wondering if you have any Wiis in stock. If the answer is 'no,' ask "When do you expect to have one?" If one is in stock, go to the store right away. If you are not legally allowed to drive a car by yourself, ask your parents or guardians to drive you to the store right away. Wiis sell very quickly when they are in stock!

, Otherwise, try to find an employee or a manager and ask them some questions about when they get their Wii shipments.
 If they don't know, hang around a little bit in case some get put out on the sales floor.
 These are the key to getting the Wii. Be at the store earlier than they expect to get the Wii in case they quickly sell out. They can't guarantee when they will have one. If it comes a little later, keep waiting till one comes in. If a Wii doesn't come in stock, keep calling stores and keep using steps one and two. You will get one eventually.
 There are also some pretty good wii trackers online that will help you track down a Nintendo Wii and also send you alerts when they become available.

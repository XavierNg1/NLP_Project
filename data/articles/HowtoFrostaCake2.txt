 To make the icing easier to spread, it may be helpful to warm it slightly or add a tablespoon of corn syrup and mix well. Then, take your offset spatula and add a large dollop to the top center of the cake., Use your spatula to spread the frosting outwards from the center. You can spin the cake plate to make this easier. Donâ€™t worry about getting the frosting perfectly smooth yet, just make sure that the crumb coat is completely covered., Add a bit of frosting to the center of one of the sides, and work in one direction to spread it outwards. Keep your spatula parallel to the sides of the cake as your spread, adding more frosting when necessary., Take your spatula back to the top of the cake, and work slowly back and forth across the surface to smooth it. Do the same to the sides, wiping off any excess frosting when necessary. When you are sure your cake is just right, remove the wax paper strips from the bottom and enjoy your perfectly smooth cake!

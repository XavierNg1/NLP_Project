 Vinegar is a great natural disinfectant and is non toxic. You can use white distilled vinegar or apple cider vinegar for this cleaning method. Mix the vinegar and water together in a spray bottle or a bowl.








If you dislike the strong vinegar smell, you can add five to ten drops of lavender or lemon essential oils to the cleaner.;
, Spray the vinegar cleaner on the blocks. You can also dip a dry cloth into the bowl with the cleaner. Give them a good wipe down to remove bacteria, germs, and dirt.








Never immerse the blocks in water or cleaner as this can damage the wood.
 The vinegar smell should dissipate as the blocks dry. Once they are dry, they are safe to use.








Do not put the toys out in direct sunlight to dry, as this can cause them to crack. Instead, let them dry indoors in a room with indirect sunlight.

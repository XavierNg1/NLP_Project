 Before you get your dog, you should ask them what kind of leash and collar you might need. Depending on the type of dog, its temperament and the intensity of your walks, there is a variety of leashes and collars that you will want to consider. If you have puppy, they will also likely recommend that you leash train it.Your veterinarian may be able to supply you with the appropriate collar and leash. If not, you should be able to find them at your local pet supply store.
 If your dog does not have any obedience issues, this collar is a great option. It allows your dog to walk beside you comfortably and with a limited amount of control. This is the best option for well-trained dogs that have few behavioral issues.Remember to walk beside your dog in order to maintain control.
 If your dog is young or has issues while walking, try a slip collar. This will give you greater control over your dog and help you correct its behavior if it gets distracted. With a quick and firm tug to the side, you can get your dog’s attention and refocus it on the walk.If you are having troubles with a slip collar, consider pairing it with a pack leader collar. This will give you greater control and help you avoid hurting your dog.
Avoid pulling back while using a slip collar. This can hurt your dog’s neck.
If you are unfamiliar with using a slip collar, talk to your veterinarian before you use the tool.
 If you want your dog to pull you, you will need to get a harness. This is a great option if you want to roller blade or ride your bike while walking your dog. The harness distributes the weight of pulling across the dog’s entire body, instead of just around its neck.A harness is also a great option for dogs with slender necks, like Greyhounds, and dogs with breathing problems, like pugs and bulldogs.

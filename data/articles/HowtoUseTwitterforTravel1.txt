 These users can supply you with information about hot tourist spots or current events in that location; plus, you can send messages (known as "Tweets") to those users for tips, help, and guidance while traveling.


Find users that reside at your travel destination by performing a keyword or hashtag search in Twitter. For example, if you are traveling to Amsterdam, type "Amsterdam travel" or "#Amsterdam" into the Twitter search field, then follow tourism bureaus and similar users that display in the search results.;
, Many major airlines and hotel chains will advertise deals exclusively for Twitter users, so their followers can take advantage of special offers, discounts, and other incentives.


Search for major airlines and hotels using the Twitter search field, or go to the websites for those businesses and search for the links to their Twitter accounts.
 Some of the Twitter accounts you follow may have hundreds or thousands of other followers, so making reservations immediately may ensure that you secure an airplane seat or hotel room when deals are offered.
 In most cases, residents can give you tips and information about hotels and restaurants with the best reputations and service in the area. For example, when visiting Las Vegas, Nevada, ask local users about the hotels and casinos that offer the best buffets.

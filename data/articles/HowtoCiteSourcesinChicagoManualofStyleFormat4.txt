 You do not want to forget to include a citation, as this could constitute plagiarism. Being accused of plagiarism, especially in a university or college setting, can get you a bad grade or even expelled.
 Write author last name and publication year in parentheses. If it is a direct quotation, add the page number after a comma. If the author is already mentioned in the statement, just put the year and page number in parentheses. If there are two authors, name them both with "and" in the middle. Use commas if there are more than two authors. Place the citation before a punctuation mark.


E.g. Leaving the ground in sod increases the organic matter of the soil by 15% in 10 years (Alison 1993).
 Add a superscript number at the end of the statement to denote which source it is referring to. Even if you refer to the same source multiple times, it gets a new superscript number every time. Start the superscript numbers from 1 every time you start a new page. You will need to list the source as footnote at the bottom of the page, as well as in the bibliography at the end of the paper.

 You will use this bottle or canning jar to mix up the cough syrup, but also to store the syrup in the fridge. Using one jar or bottle makes clean up easier.


It’s helpful to use a bottle or jar with a secure lid so that you can mix the ingredients in the jar without spilling them, but also to store the syrup without worrying about it making a sticky mess in your fridge.
 Carefully measure these ingredients and add them to the jar.


If the honey is solid, place it in the microwave or heat it in a water bath for a minute or two, to make it easier to evenly combine these ingredients. Depending on your microwave wattage, you might need to do this at a lower power level so you don’t boil or burn the honey.
 After you’ve added the ingredients, place the lid on the jar or bottle and shake it vigorously to combine all of the ingredients.
 You can take this syrup more often than typical cough medicine because it does not contain any ingredients that would cause drowsiness.This syrup can also help with congestion and clear your sinuses.
 The syrup can settle in the fridge, so shake well before each use to fully incorporate the ingredients. You might have to warm it up before shaking since the honey solidifies in the fridge.


Remember, you might need to use a lower power level setting when microwaving.
 The honey will solidify in the refrigerator, and the spices will lose some of their potency, so the syrup will be more effective if you make it every few days.

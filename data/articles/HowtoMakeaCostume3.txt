 This should consist of clothes that you don't mind ruining.
 Stain the clothes with fake blood or tea. Then, take a soapstone, steel wool, or other rough object and rub it on the clothes at the hems and other key points to create wear.


If you do so carefully, you can even burn the clothes slightly. Just make sure that they are 100% cotton and you have something to stamp the fire out with. You should also be sure to do this outside in a safe area.
 You will want to apply dark makeup around your eyes. You can also add fake blood around your mouth. Depending on skin tone, you might want to add white makeup to the rest of your face as well.
 Drag a leg, hold out your arms, and don't be afraid to do some research!

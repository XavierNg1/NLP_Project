 This will help your hair sway over your shoulder in a smooth, fluid motion. It is possible to flip hair with any texture, but the smoother your hair is, the more effective the motion will be.
 If possible, try to make eye contact with them for a brief second. Do not overdo it, however, or you will be too obvious.
 Start with a part of your hair draped over your shoulder. Place the back of your hand against your hair, and quickly flick your hand back at the wrist. This will cause your hair to flip over your shoulder.


This works best with hair that falls somewhere between your shoulders and your elbows. If your hair is too long or too short, it may not be as effective
Use a small, less dramatic motion. This will help make it look more natural. If you try to make a huge show of your hair flip, and make a large gesture, you will look overly-dramatic and unnatural.
 This was work with just about any length of ponytail, but it will be most effective with tails that reach your shoulder. Simply turn your head towards one shoulder, and very quickly sweep your head towards the other shoulder. To make your flick even more effective, try to dip your head down slightly as you reach the middle of your "turn." This creates a dip or curve that causes your ponytail to flip even more.


Depending on the length of your hair, you might end up catching someone in the face.
 Hair flipping is often associated with sass and confidence. You can make yourself appear more confident by standing tall with your back straight and your head held high.

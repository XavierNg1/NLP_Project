 Cut the length of your wood strips to be a little longer than your necessary final measurement. The curve will shorten the length.









Before you cut, make a diagonal line with a pencil and a ruler across the bottom of your stock. This way, if the wood strips get dropped or rearranged, you'll be able to tell which order your strips belong in.
Cut your wood strips through a straight-grained edge, not on the face-grain side.This will help you put back the strips together with minimal interruption.
 Cork with help both anchor the lamination to its form and even out any irregularities in the sawn form so that you have an even crisper bend.
 The glued strips will hold the wood in the bent shape.









Use a disposable roller to dispense the glue onto the wood.
Use the right kind of glue:

Try a two-part urea-formaldehyde glue.This glue sets very hard but also slowly.
Try an epoxy. Epoxies are very effective but also expensive.
Do not use standard wood glue for bent laminations. Normal wood glue sets soft and quickly, making it less ideal for this kind of project.
 Top this with another wood strip lined with glue. Repeat this process until you have obtained your desired thickness. Clamp the pieces together. Once the glue is dry, cut the ends to your desired measurement.

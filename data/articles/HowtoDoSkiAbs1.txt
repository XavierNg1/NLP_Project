 The ski abs exercise is a plank variation, so you start in the full, straight-arm plank position. Make sure your wrists are positioned directly under your shoulders and your back is flat.Keep your head and neck in a neutral position. Don't crunch your neck or hunch your shoulders up around your ears.;
, Ski abs is an abdominal exercise, so most of your strength and stability is going to come from your abdominal muscles. Lightly contract your core to engage the muscles. Don't hold your breath.You may want to take a few deep breaths from plank position before you start the exercise, so you get used to breathing while also engaging your abdominal muscles.
 To start the ski abs exercise, hop both of your feet over to the right side of your body. Bend your knees and aim to have your knees just outside your right elbow.Keep your torso flat and parallel to the floor. Use your abdominals to maintain stability.
 As soon as you complete the jump to the right, you want to jump your feet all the way back to the full plank position where you started. Again, focus on keeping your torso parallel with the floor., From plank, immediately jump to the other side. If you've ever seen downhill skiers, you now understand the reasoning behind this exercise's name. The movements are somewhat similar to a skier's.After you jump on the other side, don't forget to jump back to plank before continuing the exercise. Between each side, return to the center plank position.
You can use gliders under your feet to add a new challenge to the ski abs exercise. Come down to your elbows and forearms so your torso has a little more stability., The ski abs exercise is best done in an interval, rather than a specific number of sets. Set a stopwatch for 30 seconds or a minute, and do as many ski abs as you can with good form during that time.

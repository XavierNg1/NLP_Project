 If you are unable to administer the necessary medication and health care, then you can seek the help of a full-time nurse, part-time nurse, caregiver, physical therapist or occupational therapist. Begin with part-time care and increase in the future if necessary.


Professional carers can be expensive. However, it may be your parent's preference if they want to live as long as possible at home, instead of in a facility.
 If you are devoting time to caring for your parents, then you should make sure you are getting the most value out of their medical care. Parents with memory loss or mental disabilities may not remember or ask the right questions, so go to the appointments and take notes.
 Make sure all the prescriptions are filled at 1 place. Losing track of medication can result in an unforeseen drug interaction, causing further illness.
 If your parent's disabilities are large or their home is unsafe, then relocation may be the best option. Discuss their concerns and look for a place that you can visit often.

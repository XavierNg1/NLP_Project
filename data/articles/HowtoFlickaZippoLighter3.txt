 This trick can be very dangerous and you should only try it if you are very confident in your ability. You want to make sure that you have fluid, but that your Zippo isn’t freshly filled and dripping lighter fluid.


If your wick is too wet or your Zippo is leaking, the fluid could spill onto your pants and when you light your Zippo, the extra fluid could catch fire, and be extremely dangerous.
 It’s best to do this trick with the hand that you feel most comfortable with. Hold the Zippo with the hinge facing toward your index finger.


You want to hold your Zippo between your thumb and forefinger with the lid sitting enough above your hand so that it can open the lid fully without being blocked.
 This should be a swift motion so that the lid of your Zippo can make contact with your thigh and kick open.









You want to strike the lid on the edge of your thigh so you can get the lid open without causing so much force that you snap the hinge.
The presser of the lid on your thigh is actually causing it to stay in place, while the momentum of your hand keeps the part of the Zippo in your hand moving, causing the lighter to open.
 In one fluid motion, you want to make contact with your thigh and the wheel, then run it along your thigh to make the wheel turn while very quickly lifting the lighter off your pants so that the flame doesn’t catch any fabric.









Think of it like rolling a toy car across your thigh, and then quickly flicking your wrist upward as if the car has suddenly taken flight.
 Once you have completed your trick, close your lid by snapping it forward and down with a flick of your wrist.

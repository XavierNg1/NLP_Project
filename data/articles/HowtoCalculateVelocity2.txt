 Acceleration is the change in velocity. If the acceleration is constant, the velocity continues to change at the same rate. We can describe this by multiplying acceleration and time, and adding the result to the initial velocity:


vf=vi+at{\displaystyle v_{f}=v_{i}+at}, or "final velocity = initial velocity + (acceleration * time)"

Initial velocity vi{\displaystyle v_{i}} is sometimes written as v0{\displaystyle v_{0}} ("velocity at time 0").
 This will tell you how much the velocity increased (or decreased) over this time period.


Example: A ship sailing north at 2 m/s accelerates north at a rate of 10 m/s2. How much did the ship's velocity increase in the next 5 seconds?

a = 10 m/s2

t = 5 s

(a * t) = (10 m/s2 * 5 s) = 50 m/s increase in velocity.
 Now you know the total change in the velocity. Add this to the initial velocity of the object, and you have your answer.


Example (cont): In this example, how fast is the ship traveling after 5 seconds?


vf=vi+at{\displaystyle v_{f}=v_{i}+at}


vi=2m/s{\displaystyle v_{i}=2m/s}


at=50m/s{\displaystyle at=50m/s}


vf=2m/s+50m/s=52m/s{\displaystyle v_{f}=2m/s+50m/s=52m/s}




, Unlike speed, velocity always includes the direction of movement. Make sure to include this in your answer.

In our example, since the ship started going north and did not change direction, its final velocity is 52 m/s north.
 As long as you know the acceleration, and the velocity at any one point in time, you can use this formula to find the velocity at any other time. Here's an example solving for the initial velocity:

"A train accelerates at 7 m/s2 for 4 seconds, and ends up traveling forward at a velocity of 35 m/s. What was its initial velocity?"


vf=vi+at{\displaystyle v_{f}=v_{i}+at}35m/s=vi+(7m/s2)(4s){\displaystyle 35m/s=v_{i}+(7m/s^{2})(4s)}35m/s=vi+28m/s{\displaystyle 35m/s=v_{i}+28m/s}vi=35m/sâˆ’28m/s=7m/s{\displaystyle v_{i}=35m/s-28m/s=7m/s}

 Add 1 part of baking soda and 1 part of water to a jar or squeeze bottle. Shake the mixture well to ensure that the ingredients are fully combined.Filtered or distilled water works best, but you can use tap water.
Mix the baking soda wash in the container that you plan to store it in your shower so you don’t have to transfer the mixture.
The baking soda and water will separate as they sit on the bathroom shelf, so be sure to shake the bottle well before each use.
 When you’re ready to use the baking soda mixture to shampoo, wet your hair thoroughly. Pour the baking soda mixture onto your scalp, massaging it in with your fingers. Apply more as needed, but keep the mixture concentrated on your scalp.You don’t need to apply the baking soda wash to the ends of your hair because the scalp is where all of the natural oils are. The mixture will also be washed through the length when you rinse your hair.
 After you’ve applied the baking soda mixture to your entire scalp, let it sit for 1 to 2 minutes. Wash it out with cool water as you would with regular shampoo.Because baking soda is alkaline, following it up with an acidic apple cider vinegar rinse can restore the proper pH balance to your hair. It can actually replace your usual conditioner -- just mix 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the vinegar with 1 cup (237 ml) of water in a bottle and shake well to ensure that they’re blended. Apply it to your scalp and massage it through your hair before rinsing it out.

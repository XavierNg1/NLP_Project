 Have a coach there to act as your guide. You should be able to do a normal back dive off a 1-meter board without issue. You should also understand the basics of diving., Stand backwards on the edge of the 1-meter diving board. Your shoulders should be in a vertical line over your hips. Place your arms down at your sides.Keep your head in a neutral position and begin to rock the board.
Lift your arms over your head, keeping them straight. Begin to quickly rotate your arms behind your body slightly.
As you rotate your arms, bend your legs to prepare to jump from the board.
 Swing your arms forcefully into a back press. Keep your head aligned with your arms.Jump up and out off of the board.
Once you’re in the air, your feet should be pointed towards the board and your body should be at a backward angle.
 Extend your arms in a straight position overhead near your ears. Point your legs towards the diving board at an angle in the air so that they “chase” your head and arms.Rotate your arms behind your body quickly in a small half-circle. This action will increase the momentum of the rotation for your flip.
Bend your legs into a tuck position and grab onto your shins once your arms have completed the half-circle movement.
 Hold your tight tuck position briefly. Keep your eyes open. Look for the board and use it as your signal to come out of the somersault at the right time.Fold yourself out of the somersault/tuck position once you see the board. Aim your legs towards the water and slightly in front of you.
Punch your feet into the water at a slight angle so that your body finishes the rotation you started.
As you enter the water, place your arms at the sides of your body.

 When you’re ready, open your eyes, relax your arms, and rise.
 Alternate nostril breathing is often performed before meditation.Walking meditation involves finding a quiet outdoor space in a park or backyard, and walking through it at a slow or medium pace. Stay aware of the many sensations in your feet: your feet touching the ground, the movement of your legs, and the fit of your socks and shoes.


If you have trouble engaging in meditation at first, be patient with yourself and keep at it. The more you practice meditation, the better your technique will be, and you’ll be able to find more ways to focus on staying mindful and calm.
 Close your eyes and picture someone that you’re grateful for. Think of one aspect of their face that you really like -- their eyes, nose, or mouth, for instance. Send them a mental thank-you note by simply thinking, “I am thankful you’re in my life.” Repeat for five or six friends and family members.

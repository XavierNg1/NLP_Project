 Eating a healthy, balanced diet as part of your normal lifestyle is ideal. However, if you are just looking to make some positive lifestyle changes before surgery to aid your recovery, then altering your diet is a great place to start.

Focus on eating whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products.
Reduce your intake of fried, processed, and sugary foods. Try to steer clear of fast food, baked goods, and snacks like chips and crackers.
Drink plenty of water. Cut back on sugary beverages, such as soda and juices. Instead, try to get most of your fluid intake from water. Aim for at least eight 8 ounce glasses of water daily.
Talk to your doctor for advice about how to improve your diet. Your doctor may be able to make specific recommendations based on your needs and diagnosis.;

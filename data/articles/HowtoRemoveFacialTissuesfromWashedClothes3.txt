 These pieces tend to be more difficult to remove as they will have stuck to the fabric. Once they are loosened by the dryer, they should come off in one piece and will be easier to remove by hand., Masking tape will work, and duct tape is even better due to its strength. Wrap the tape around your hand with the adhesive side facing outward, and dab the clothing. The tissue should stick to the tape, easily removing it from your clothes., A lint roller is inexpensive and can be purchased at almost any convenient store. Roll it along your clothing, and the tissue and lint should stick to it.

The listing process is developed in such a way that you are guided through every step seamlessly.;
, This can be revised at any time by using the "Previous Step"¬ù navigation button. Type in the following: <="" your="" for="" category="" secondary="" a="" select="" also="" can="" you="" available="">

, A full viewing editor is in place to enable you to use HTML descriptions.
 This can be entered just below the description field.
 On this step, you can set the following:


Auction type
Standard Auction: This is a single quantity auction.
Dutch Auction: Dutch auction enables you to list a multiple quantity auction. For example, if you have 100 pens to sell you can list all of these together in a single lot. Bidders will be able to select how many they wish to bid for.
Currency: You can select your preferred auction currency using the drop down menu available.
Quantity: This field is only active if listing a Dutch auction. Please see above for an explanation of this listing type.
Auction Starts At: This requires you to enter the minimum bid you are willing to accept. You can also set a reserve price to ensure you do not sell the item for this amount. Please see below for more information on this.
Reserve Price: Enabling a reserve price effectively means you will not sell the item for less than the amount set, for example you can set the start price at 5.00 but only accept winning bids over 50.00, should a bid be placed for 49.99 the item will close without a winner.
Buy out (if available): Buy out allows you to set an amount you are willing to sell the item for straight out. For example you can set the start price to 10.00 but offer interested parties the option to buy the item immediately for 100.00.

You can also list buy out only auctions. These auctions remove all bidding options, meaning the listing can only be purchased for a set amount. To set a buy out only auction, you need to set the buy out value to be exactly equal with the start bid.


Offer-Range (if available): You can set a price bracket in which you are willing to list to give offers. For example, if you set the price brackets from 15.00 to 100.00 interested parties will be able to offer you an amount within these brackets, you can opt whether to accept or decline these offers at any time via the member's area.
Bid increment: This option can be used to set your own custom bid increment if preferred.
Item featuring (if available): The following options are available to you (fees may apply), these will highlight your item on site to ensure they reach more visitors:

Highlighted background


Set start/end time: You can either opt to list your item right away and set a defined number of days for it to be live for or you also have the option to define your own custom start/end time.
Private Auction: Private auction will hide the bidder's identity on the item details page.
Image upload: To accompany your item, you can either upload images from your local computer or enter the URL of an image(s) hosted elsewhere
Media upload: In addition to images, you can also upload media files. Please note that only .avi/.mpeg/.mov are supported.
Auto Re-List: For convenience, you can opt to have your items automatically re-listed for you. Options are available to allow you to select whether the item should be re-listed if sold, and how many re-list attempts should be made.
 This includes your shipping rates and available methods of delivery.
 Please note that you can still edit your listing once live, via the members' area.


You will then be provided with listing confirmation.

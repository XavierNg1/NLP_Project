 Rubbing alcohol is often your best bet for removing the oil-based ink found in most pens. It dissolves oils, allowing you to wipe the ink off your skin.Many other cleaning agents use alcohol as the main solvent, so using it straight should give you the best results.









Try not to use the rubbing alcohol in a small, confined space, as the smell is very strong.Isopropyl alcohol and its fumes are extremely flammable, so don't use it around an open flame or heat source.The alcohol will also remove your body's natural oils along with the pen, so you should moisturize after rubbing it on your skin.;
, If you don't have rubbing alcohol on hand, look for an alcohol-based hairspray instead.The alcohol will break down the ink. Depending on the concentration of alcohol used in the hairspray, it may take a few applications to remove the ink.








The hairspray will leave behind a sticky residue, so once the ink has been removed, rinse your skin with soap and water.Hairspray is highly flammable, so be careful when you are spraying it. You should never use it anywhere near an open flame.
 The solvent acetone will cause the pen ink to break down and dissolve, similar to rubbing alcohol. It is also highly flammable like alcohol, and the vapors can be toxic in large amounts, so use in a well-ventilated area.








Acetone can be very harsh on your skin, so use it sparingly and be sure to rinse your arm with soap and water and moisturize afterwards.
 The alcohol in hand sanitizer will break down and loosen the pen. Wipe the area with a clean cloth and the ink will wipe off with the sanitizer.








The amount of alcohol in hand sanitizer varies. Look for one that is 60%-90% alcohol., Vinegar contains the acetic acid,which is an effective solvent that can dissolve oil and many other compounds.


Using a rough paper towel will help exfoliate the skin,and remove layers of dead skin cells that are stained by the ink.

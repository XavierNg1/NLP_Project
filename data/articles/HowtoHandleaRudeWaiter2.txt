 If the waiter continues to be rude to you, take the initiative by asking to speak to the manager. Ask your waiter, another waiter, or the hostess to please send the manager by your table.


You could also ask to be served by a different waiter. Tell them, “We’d appreciate it if you could have someone else cover our table. Our waiter is being unprofessional.”Once you inform the manager, you might even get a voucher for a free meal. Tip 15% on whatever the original check amount was., If you are still unhappy, contact someone with more company authority. Most companies are going to be very angry to hear that you were treated negatively and will want to make it up to you. If the waiter truly was rude, it may help you feel better to know that someone “higher up the ladder" reprimanded them.


Only contact the business owner or head of the company if you truly feel that you were treated unfairly. Try to handle any miscommunications with the waiter or management first.
 Except in cases of a severely dangerous situation (fire/severe injury/insult) you should tip your waiter 15%, or the standard tipping amount for your area. Remember, your waiter may be having an off day. Waiters are given a small paycheck, and many times rely on tips as their main source of income.Many times waiters must share their tips with other waitstaff such as busboys, runners or other servers. Remember that you are taking away from their tips, too.It may not be customary to tip in all English-speaking countries, so tip only where appropriate.

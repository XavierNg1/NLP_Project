 If your child is experiencing a nose or mouth twitch, sometimes the best solution is to ignore it. Calling attention to it might actually trigger it or harm self-esteem. Tics are common in children: up to one and four develop a tic that lasts between one month and one year before puberty.Consider your child’s age and when the tic started occurring.
If any vocal tics or complex involuntary movements accompany a facial twitch, you should see your child’s pediatrician rather than ignore these symptoms. In combination, they can indicate neurological disorders such as Tourette syndrome.Having a tic may also lead to a lack of socialization and stress for the child.
 Note when your child experiences a facial twitch. Write down instances to try to identify patterns. Have a conversation with him or her if they are of vocal age, and gently ask them to identify feelings or circumstances that give rise to the twitch., If the facial twitch persists for a year or more, consult your child’s doctor. Any notes you’ve taken on the tic’s causes and patterns will be beneficial. Your doctor can order tests or refer you to a specialist if necessary.

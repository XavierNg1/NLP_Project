 This old-fashioned recipe, called vinegaroon or vinegar black, is a cheap and easy way to permanently dye your leather dark black. The color will not rub off onto fingers or clothes, and you can save the leftover dye for later use./images/thumb/3/3d/Dye-Leather-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-11-Version-3.jpg

This method works best on vegetable-tanned leather (or antique pit-tanned leather). If the leather is already dyed, it was probably chrome-tanned and sealed, and vinegaroon will not give good results.
 You can use uncoated iron nails, iron shavings, or any other material that will rust (and ideally has already started to rust). Steel wool is one of the fastest options, since you can tear it into small fragments, but it has an oil coating to prevent rust. Get rid of this first by dunking the steel wool in acetone, squeezing it out, then letting it dry completely./images/thumb/b/bf/Dye-Leather-Step-12-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-12-Version-3.jpg

Acetone can irritate skin, but occasional contact shouldn't cause lasting harm.Wearing latex gloves is recommended., Heat about a half gallon (two liters) of white vinegar or apple cider vinegar until it is hot, but not too hot to touch.Pour it back into the container it was sold in, or into any convenient container.

, Over time, the rust (iron oxide) will react with the vinegar (acetic acid). This form a substance called ferric acetate, which reacts with tannins to dye the leather./images/thumb/4/4b/Dye-Leather-Step-14-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-14-Version-3.jpg

The amount of iron to add depends on the concentration of the vinegar. The easiest approach is to start with a large quantity (thirty nails, as a ballpark estimate), then keep adding metal until it stops dissolving., Punch a hole in the lid to let off gases, or the container could explode. Close the lid and put the container in a warm location for at least a week or two. The "vinegarroon" is ready when the iron is dissolved and there is no strong vinegar smell./images/thumb/3/39/Dye-Leather-Step-15-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-15-Version-3.jpg

If it still smells strongly of vinegar, add more iron. If there's already iron in there, heat over the stove to speed up the reaction.
Once almost all of the acetic acid is gone, any remaining iron will rust normally, turning the liquid reddish. At this point you can leave the lid off for a couple days to help the last dregs of the acetic acid evaporate.
 Run the vinegaroon through paper towels or coffee filters repeatedly until the liquid is free from solids./images/thumb/f/f4/Dye-Leather-Step-16-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-16-Version-3.jpg

, Brew an extra-strong black tea, then let the water cool. Soak the leather in it to add extra tannin. This will improve the effects of the vinegaroon, and help prevent cracking./images/thumb/0/07/Dye-Leather-Step-17-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-17-Version-3.jpg

Professional leather workers sometimes use tannic acid or logwood extract instead.
 The liquid will penetrate into the leather and add a deep, permanent dye. Don't be alarmed if the color looks grey or bluish. It should deepen to black during the process, and become darker after oiling.

It's a good idea to test a similar piece of scrap leather first, or one corner of the object. If it cracks after a couple days, dilute the vinegaroon in water and try again., Mix 3 tbs. (45 mL) baking soda in one quart (1L) of water. Saturate the leather with the solution and then rinse with clean water. This neutralizes the acid in the vinegar solution to keep your leather from disintegrating later on.

, While the leather is still damp, rub your favorite leather oil over the surface. You may need two coats of the oil to fully condition the leather. Choose the oil that works best for your leather product by testing on a small portion of the leather.

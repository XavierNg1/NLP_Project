 Leave frozen, pre-cooked crab legs in the refrigerator overnight to thaw slowly.


You could thaw the crab legs a little more quickly by placing them beneath cold, running water for a few minutes.
 Add about 2 cups (500 ml) of water to the bottom of a large steamer pot along with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) saltand set it to boiling over medium-high to high heat.


You need to have enough water to cover the bottom, but not so much that it touches the bottom of the steamer rack.
You could also use a heavy stockpot, as long as you have a steaming basket or steamer rack that will fit over it.
 Arrange the crab legs in an even layer on the steamer rack and position the rack over the pot of boiling water.


Ideally, you should use a steamer rack or basket that can be lowered into the pot so that the pot itself can be closed.
 Cover the pot of boiling water with a lid and cook the crab legs for about six minutes.


Make sure that the water is boiling before you cover the pot and start the timer.
The finished crab legs should have a "cooked odor."

, Remove them from the basket with a tong and serve them warm with a side of melted butter.

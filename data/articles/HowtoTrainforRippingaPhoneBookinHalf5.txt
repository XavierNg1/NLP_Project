 Instead of ripping a few whole books in a session, divide a dozen or more books at the spine into halves, thirds or quarters. Then rip 25 to 30 times. This will prove to be more fun and extends the ripping opportunities over a longer period of time. Doing it this way allows you to build up a base of strength (and technique) and future workouts will be easier and less reliant on your nerves.


A good rule to follow is one taken direct from weight training––if you cannot do five repetitions of a lift, you are lifting too heavy. Applied to phone book ripping, if you cannot rip a few books in a session, you should be ripping thinner books.

Train your grip (very important), forearm rotators, upper back muscles and chest muscles. The arms get worked from doing the chest and upper back exercises; do not do any arm work unless you are doing a row instead of the the pull-up. Rows do not work the biceps much.
After training for at least three or four workouts, you will be rearing to go, so go tear those few phone books in half.

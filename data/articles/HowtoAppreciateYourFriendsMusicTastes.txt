 Whenever you meet new people, the inevitable question that tends to get asked is, "What type of music do you like?". This question is usually answered in one of two ways. One, "Oh I'm into rock/classical/(insert a genre)". Or "Oh, I like all types of music".

The second option usually means that one has a varied taste in music, regardless of genre. You must ask yourself how you'd answer that question.;
, So, you like rock music, but your friend has a big crush on One Direction? Polar opposites right? Not necessarily. Look into the music you listen to and see if there is any crossover with your friends taste.

In the example situation, maybe you like some pop / rock songs and they like some pop songs which feature guitars. This overlap in tastes gives you a foothold to share a portion of their taste in music.
 If you listen to their songs and, then, they listen to your songs, eventually both of you may start to see your music tastes soften and you'll both appreciate some aspects of each other's music.

Make a playlist that features songs choices from both of you to listen to when hanging out and, eventually, you may hear your friend say "Hmmm, that song wasn't half bad".
 By seeing a band you either don't like or don't know much about in concert, you may not definitely grow to love them on the spot, but it does put the music into a different environment and gives it a new energy.

Amongst a large group of fans, you can see and feel how loved the music is. A festival combines this idea with the playlist idea; you can see a range of bands and introduce your friends to your types of music whilst seeing theirs in the company of people who love the music.

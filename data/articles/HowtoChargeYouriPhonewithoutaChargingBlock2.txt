 If your charger has frayed wires near the plug, itâ€™s fairly simple to repair. Using scissors or a sharp blade, carefully cut away the plastic casing from the frayed end of the charger. Be careful not to cut any of the wires inside the casing., Using your scissors or blade, make a clean cut right through the frayed area., Strip away about an inch (if possible) of the protective rubber casing. This will expose the three wires inside the cable.
 This will expose the metal filaments that make the wire. Make sure you don't sever these metal filaments while stripping the protective casing.


Do this on both ends.
 Match the colors of the protective casing and twist the matching wires together.
 Cover the exposed metal for each connection. This will prevent the exposed wires from touching each other and shorting the connection.
 This will help keep the wires in place and secure.
 You can find this tubing at electronic supply stores like Radio Shack, or use a rubber replacement.

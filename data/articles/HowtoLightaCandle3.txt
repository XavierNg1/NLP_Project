 Some people say that trimming the wick the first time you use a candle causes it to burn unevenly. A larger flame can help start the wax melting properly.However, always supervise the burn carefully.
 Your candle should burn for an hour for every inch it is in diameter, at least for the first time. Therefore, if you measure four inches across the top of the candle, that means it needs to burn for four hours.The purpose is that you want to make sure the whole top layer of the candle melts.
If it doesn't, you'll get a tunneling effect as the candle burns down. In other words, it will just melt down the center of the candle, instead of melting the whole candle.
Doing it this way will help you burn your candle more evenly.
 To prevent tunneling after you burn it the first time, you should burn it for longer stretches at a time rather than shorter. Shorter stretches won't melt the wax all the way to the edges like you want., Take a piece of foil folded over several times, and wrap it around the top of the candle. Tip it slightly over the top of the candle, forming a small lip.You can do it while the candle is light, though the top will be hot. Otherwise, light it after you put the foil on.This trick helps to melt the wax more evenly. You can get special lids for candles that achieve the same purpose.

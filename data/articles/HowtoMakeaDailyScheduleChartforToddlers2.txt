 Write your toddler’s name at the top – “Jane’s Morning Routine at Age 4” or “John’s Daily Routine at Age 4”. You can make it colorful by using different colored markers or you can use just one color.


You can also use felt letters that you can buy from craft stores or bookstores that come in different colors and paste them to the paper.
 A chart that depicts making the bed, dressing up, brushing teeth, breakfast and bathing will have four vertical lines.
 These days should run Monday through Sunday. These horizontal lines should intersect each of the vertical lines that you drew.


You should have something that looks like a giant graph paper after drawing these horizontal lines.
 Place your toddler’s pictures at the top in a row according to what she will need to do first every morning. The order may go: making the bed, dressing up, brushing teeth, breakfast, bathing, playing and reading.
 Tape the chart to the wall of your toddler’s bedroom. Once this is done, you can make the routine charts for the afternoon, and bedtime.


For the afternoon routine chart, you can place pictures of your toddler taking a nap, then eating a snack then walking in the park or playing in the playground.
For the bedtime routine, place pictures of your child eating dinner, brushing teeth, bathing, reading a book and sleeping in her bed.
 Again, she could also use a whiteboard marker to check off the item, so long as the chart is laminated.

 Try some golden and/or tan flats, a white/tan shirt of any design, and black skinny jeans. The black contrasts with any gold that you are wearing and makes it more prominent.
 However, avoid wearing jeans with glimmers of silver while wearing black nail polish.
 Don't cut nails too close or your fingers will look stubby. Also, don't wear nails too long or you will look like you have witch talons.

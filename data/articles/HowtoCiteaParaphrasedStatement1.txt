 For a basic book citation on the reference page, which you use when you paraphrase from another source, you start with the last name.


Follow that with a comma and the first name: “Bruno, Jessica.”
Use a period after the name.;
, Next, put the name of the book in italics: “Bruno, Jessica. Feeding Hedgehogs.”


Use a period after the title.
 Use the city and state if it’s obscure: “Bruno, Jessica. Feeding Hedgehogs. Fayetteville, Arkansas:”


Use a colon after the state.
 Follow this with a comma and the year.


“Bruno, Jessica. Feeding Hedgehogs. Fayetteville, Arkansas: Catfish Publications, 1995.”

, Make sure to detail the publication type: print, audio, video, etc.


“Bruno, Jessica. Feeding Hedgehogs. Fayetteville, Arkansas: Catfish Publications, 1995. Print.”

, To reference the citation in your paper, use parenthesis at the end of the sentence you’re paraphrasing.


Put the author and the page number in the parenthesis: “Hedgehogs mainly consume insects (Bruno 22).
For a source within a source, the reference page citation will stay the same. That is, if Bruno paraphrases Jeff Jones as saying hedgehogs don’t eat much vegetation, then you make a citation for Bruno on the reference page and change the in-text citation: “Hedgehogs don’t eat much vegetation (Jones cited in Bruno 22).”

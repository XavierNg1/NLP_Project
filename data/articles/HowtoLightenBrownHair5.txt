 Bring 1 cup of water to a boil. You can boil this water on the stove, or in a microwave. If you boil the water on the stove it may take between three to five minutes to boil. If you boil the water in a microwave, it may take between two to three minutes.
 Start out by mixing in 2 teaspoons of both henna powder and chamomile powder into the hot water. The powder measurements have to be equal in size.The end result should have a paste-like consistency, so if the water and powders are not paste-like after 2 teaspoons each, add in one more teaspoon of each.


This part will take some trial and error. Remember, you can always add more powder, so add it in small increments.
 Wait for the mixture to cool (about 15 minutes) and use your hands to apply it to your hair. Be sure that your hair is sectioned off, so you can add the mixture one section at a time. Once your whole head of hair is covered, use a wide-tooth comb to evenly distribute the mixture.


You may want to wear plastic gloves as you apply this to your hair; the henna powder can dye your skin.
 Once the mixture is evenly coated onto your hair, wrap your hair up in plastic wrap or a shower cap. Let the mixture sit on your hair for approximately one hour.


Consider letting the mixture sit on your hair longer, for two hours, if your hair is a darker shade of brown.
 Remove your hair covering, and rinse your hair of the mixture. Use cool to lukewarm water to rinse your hair, and shampoo like normal to remove any leftover mixture residue.

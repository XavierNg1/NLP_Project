 This will teach your fish that seeing your hand means that they will be getting fed. Make this a normal routine so that your fish becomes familiar with your hand, and knows what to expect when it comes time for feeding. This will also help your fish begin to develop trust with you.
 Start by getting your fish's attention by placing your fingertips in the water. This should get them to swim to the surface. If this does not get their attention, hold some food in your fingertips as you place them in the water. Do not release the food into the water, as you should not feed them until they have performed the trick.
 After you've gotten their attention, dangle some of their food just above the water. If your fish does not jump for the food right away, you'll need to encourage them. Place your fingertips full of food on the surface of the water, and pull them from the water as your fish approaches. This should encourage your fish to jump from the water to eat their food., This positive reinforcement will show them that jumping from the water will get them an extra treat, as opposed to just their regular food.

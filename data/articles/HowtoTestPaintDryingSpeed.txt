Test the paint using different consistencies (thicknesses) straight from the tube, palette, or can.

Latex paint can take around 30 minutes to 3 hours to dry but still needs around 2 weeks to cure (so that you can be sure it isn't bubbling)
Watercolours tend to dry quickly.
Oils can take about one to two weeks to dry completely.
Poster Color can already be dry to the touch around 30 minutes, dry to handle around 2 hours. But when it's re-coated it will dry up around 8 hours. It will take longer to dry under colder or more humid conditions.
 The environmental elements that can impact the usual time needed for dry paint include:


Humidity
Surface absorbency
Wetness or dampness
Temperature.

 If you want to know if your Sheltie has CEA, then test his eyesight. In mild cases, your dog may be able to see well enough to cope. In severe cases, your dog may be blind.Place objects in your dog’s path and see if he avoids them or bumps into the obstruction.
Take your dog on a walk along an unfamiliar route. See if he runs ahead to explore or walks hesitantly by your side as if unsure of his footing.
Wag your finger toward your dog’s eyeball and see if he blinks reflexively. Be careful that you don't create an air current when doing this or the dog may sense the air movement on his whiskers and blink because of that.;
, Watch the size of your dog's pupils and see if they become small in bright light. If the pupils remain large in bright sunshine, then there is likely a problem with the eye., Carefully compare the size of one of the eye globes with the other. It's not common, but sometimes CEA can affect the size of the globe and result in a smaller than usual eye., In rare cases, some other symptoms may present. Other symptoms that may arise are eyes that are sunken in the sockets or a cloudy film over the eyes.

 Stir for about 10 seconds.;
, Mix all the ingredients in the bowl together. Make sure all of the shredded coconut is completely covered in coconut oil.
 Using a spoon or other utensil, fill the jar about 9/10 full.
 This is an important step because otherwise the jar will be very greasy.
 Write a message onto an adhesive label. You may want to write what the gift is (coconut scrub), who it is from and a personal message. Stick the label anywhere on the jar that you think is suitable.
 Use ribbons, flowers etc to decorate and personalise your gift.
 You are now finished.

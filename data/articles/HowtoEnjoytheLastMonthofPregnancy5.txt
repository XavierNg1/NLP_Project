 Even though you feel uncomfortable now, there are many things that will be much harder to do once the baby is here. Either cook meals to be put in the freezer, or ask friends if they might be willing to help prepare food. The more prepared you are, the more you will feel free to relax.


Maybe even try to get ahead on the bills so you do not have anything on your mind except that sweet baby!

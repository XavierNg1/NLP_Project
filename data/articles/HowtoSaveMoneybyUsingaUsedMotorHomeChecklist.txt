 Engine and oil are the lifeblood for any vehicle. Checking the oil would be a good start to ensure the condition of the engine. If the oil smells burnt, you could have an issue on your hands.;
, Rust is the natural breakdown of iron and metal. RVs traveling in those parts of the country having snow and salt will be more prone to rust. Buying used motor homes from the south can help this rust problem, but they will cost more. If there is structural rust on the frames, it's better to avoid those motor homes as they are at their end of life.
 Service records will show the proper maintenance of the motor home maintained by the previous user. And if they fail to provide any paperwork, itâ€™s advisable not to accept that used motor home.
 Finance companies offer better options for certain RV builders, on certain models particularly those that have low depreciation. The purchase of a used motor home should be done without a thorough inspection of the finance options attached to that RV.

 Selecting an outfit that you won't sweat through is key. However, be sure to keep your choice classy and suitable for the occasion.You can often wear sleeveless, strapless, and halter wedding dresses for an outdoor summer wedding, and may choose to wear a matching jacket at night when the sun goes down.You should, on the other hand, feel appropriately formal in dress pants and a button-down shirt with a suit jacket over it. Dress shoes that can be comfortably danced in are a must. Opt for a tuxedo if the wedding is very formal, or if you are a member of the wedding party.;
, A long-sleeved dress or a suit made of warmer material may be more appropriate for a wedding during a cooler part of the year. If you plan on dancing, perhaps you can wear a jacket, sweater, or shawl that you can then take off while you dance. Go for comfort over style, as the more comfortable you are, the more confident you will appear., If there is a chance of rain, for instance, you will want to be prepared with a rain jacket and umbrella. Wear shoes that are waterproof, and bring a secure bag to stow any extra things that you may need, such as deodorant or makeup. If wearing a dress, be sure that it won't drag on the ground in order to prevent it from getting dirty.

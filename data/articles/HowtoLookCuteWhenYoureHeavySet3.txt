 Body shapers are worn under your clothes and help you keep your proportions in check. A good shaper should not be so tight that it leaves marks, but it will keep a little excess fat in check and give you an overall smoother, streamlined look.
 Many heavy set women are gifted with enviable busts, but this makes it even more important for you to have a supportive bra that fits you correctly. A bra that does not fit correctly may make you look saggy, but a proper fit will help you achieve a very womanly, mature look.
 Nightgowns that drape over your curves will usually look very flattering. Long gowns work well for most woman, but shorter women should also consider shorter versions of this style. Look for a gown with a deep v-neck to flatter your bust as much as possible.

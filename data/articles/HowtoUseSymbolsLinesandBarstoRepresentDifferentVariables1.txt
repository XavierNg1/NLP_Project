 A pie chart represents 100 percent of something. Each piece of the pie represents a certain percentage of the things that make up a whole.;
, Are you looking at parts of a whole? For instance, say you are studying what percentage of the student population at university eats vegetarian, vegan, or pescetarian diets. Each of those categories is a portion of a larger whole, which in this case is the student population. Therefore, a pie chart would be great for representing this information.
 To represent your information in a pie chart, figure out what percentage each part of your whole is. For example:


Let’s say you have 1,000 students in the population. 50 are vegetarian; 10 are vegan; 100 are pescetarian. That means that 5% are vegetarian; 1% is vegan, and 10% pescetarian. The rest of the students, which make up 84% of the student population, are not in any of these categories, so they are grouped together as meat-eating.
 Fill in the numbers and the labels. Often, your word processing software will do the percentages for you, though it helps to know ahead of time what it will look like so you can check to make sure it’s correct.
 The biggest chunk of your pie chart should be the meat-eating category, followed by pescetarians, the vegetarians, and then the vegans.

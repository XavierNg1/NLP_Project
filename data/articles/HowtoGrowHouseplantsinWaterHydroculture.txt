,,, Hold the plant at the base near the dirt and gently wiggle it out, dirt and all. Tapping the pot might help free the plant. Remove the dirt from the plant. Knock off loose dirt clumps. Hold under gently running tap water at room temperature to rinse off the remainder of the dirt. Trim off dead or extra roots.
 Cover the bottom of the inner pot with pebbles, about an inch. Place the plant on the pebbles, and spread out roots. Hold in place with one hand while pouring more pebbles around the plant roots up to the base. Tap the container to settle the pebbles, and then rinse under room temperature running tap water.
 Place the inner container in the outer container, and fill the pot with nutrient solution until the water level indicator shows its full enough.

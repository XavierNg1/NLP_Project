 Shaking hands is the standard greeting in the Philippines for both professional and casual environments.Here are some common cultural norms centered around the handshake:


If you are male, allow women to initiate the handshake. This demonstrates patience and gratitude.
Avoid gripping too firmly when shaking hands. Your hand grip should introduce a growing friendship, rather than the closing of a business deal.
 This will alert the person that you want their attention but also will wait for their conversation to end.


Do not touch someone’s shoulder. This can be considered disrespectful of their personal space.
 This is a common practice to get someone's attention and ask them to come over towards you.


Never grab someone’s attention by curling your index finger towards yourself. This movement is used for dogs in the Philippines, and, if you do it, the person might interpret that you think they're "lower" than a human being. , Most citizens from the Philippines can say what they think or feel just through eyes and eyebrows.


Raising eyebrows means that they are greeting you or agreeing with you. You can raise your eyebrows as well to return the greeting.
Lowering eyebrows signals disagreement. Since many Filipinos grow up learning not to cause conflict, many will resort to this movement without saying a word.
 Instead, place your hands by your sides when you are talking with someone. .Do not place your hands on your hips, as this motion is often interpreted as being angry or upset with someone.
 Filipinos are known to have a relaxed perspective on time, although visitors from other countries are expected to arrive on time. Be sure to plan accordingly. , Any advice you give in public can be interpreted as an insult to the person’s family. If you must talk with this person, have a private one-on-one conversation.

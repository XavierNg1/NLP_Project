 If you want the new belt hole to be as tidy and discreet as possible, a leather hole punch is by far the best tool. These typically cost less than $10 US at a craft or hobby store.Bring along your belt when shopping, to compare the size of the punch with the size of the existing holes. The punching tool tip should fit tightly through the existing holes.
If you have many belts to adjust, look for a rotary model with a wheel of attachments in different sizes.;
, Use a ruler or measuring tape to find the distance between each hole, then measure the same distance past the last hole. Dot the leather with a permanent marker to guide your punching.









"Protecting" the leather from the marker with tape is not a great idea, as the tape itself can cause damage.A careful dot directly where the hole will go is the safer option.
If you are making a belt from scratch, the holes are typically spaced ½" (1.25 cm) apart for belts under ⅜" (1 cm) wide, and up to 1⅛" (2.85 cm) apart for belts above 1" (2.5 cm) wide., Place the belt's marked area in between the two halves of the punching tool. Use heavy objects to keep the belt taut, or have a friend pull the belt taut in front of you.
 Squeeze the arms of the hole punch together tightly and firmly. Some thick belts may require strong hands, or someone to wiggle the taut belt back and forth as you squeeze.Let go when you feel the leather go through, and the hole should be finished.









If any leather scraps are stuck in the hole, use a toothpick to push them out.

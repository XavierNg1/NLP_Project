 While you are experimenting with which pose, angle, and facial expression to use in your photo, practice in a clean mirror. Make sure your mirror is not distorted, marked up or blurry. This will ensure the most accurate results in your findings.
 To thin yourself out, angle your body about 45 degrees away from the camera, but keep your head looking at the camera. Position your body with one foot slightly forward, or shoulder if you are sitting. , Our bodies and faces are generally not mirrored images. Find which side of your face and body you prefer and make that side more visible in the photo.


Look through photos you have posed in and you may find you have a tendency to turn your face to the right or left. This is probably the side you prefer, and feel most comfortable posing with. , This simulates height and poise. It may feel unnatural, but when roll your shoulders back and look in the mirror, you’ll find it is instantly slimming. , Place a hand on your hip and make sure there is a small separation between your limbs and body. This way your arms will not squish against your body. Play with what you are wearing. Toss your dress around or thumb your suspenders or belt., Find someone in similar age, height and body shape and look at photos they have modeled in. Try out their poses and see if their stances suit you.
 Most of the time people use clichéd poses because they are uncomfortable. These are poses like the “duck face”, “tongue-in-cheek”, or flashing a gang sign. If you are nervous step away for a minute and when you come back into frame take the photo immediately. You will have less time to be self-conscious.

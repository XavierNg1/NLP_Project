Choose a state sponsored apprenticeship. The Independent Electrical Contractors Association (IEC) partners with the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission (OESC) to offer an electrician apprenticeship program, referred to as the IEC-OKC. Funded by the United States Department of Labor, the program matches workers with employers to meet local labor market needs. Through the IEC-OKC, apprentices are employed by local electrical contractors and take classes outside of their working hours. The training program requires 8,000 hours of paid on-the-job training and prepares apprentices for licensing as a journeyman electrician in Oklahoma.
Select a union apprenticeship. In Oklahoma, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) partners with the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee to offer apprenticeship programs. The IBEW provides career placement assistance and continuing education opportunities upon completion of the apprenticeship. Union apprenticeships are available through IBEW chapters in Ponca City, Tulsa and Oklahoma City.
Choose an online electrician program. These apprenticeship programs allow students to complete classroom training online. The online programs match students with local apprenticeship programs for on-the-job training. Make sure the online electrician program is accredited by the Oklahoma State Construction Industries Board before enrolling, or the training hours may not be applicable to licensure.

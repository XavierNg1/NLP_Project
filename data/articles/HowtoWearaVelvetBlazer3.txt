 Usually they require dry cleaning. Read the interior label and follow the cleaning instructions. You can wash your blazers if they are cotton velvet, but make sure to line dry them rather than using the dryer.Store your blazers in garment bags when not in use.

 You can occasionally press them instead by using steam. Steam your blazers with a hand steamer or the steam from an iron. Don’t touch the fabric directly with the iron. Do this with the nap of the velvet facing down, and the steamer about half an inch away from the fabric.Do a test piece first to ensure that there is no damage to the fabric.
 If you spill something on your blazer, spot treat it immediately. Blot it with water and a clean cloth. It will leave a water stain, but you can then take your blazer to a dry cleaner or wash it immediately as per the care instructions on the interior label.

 Check beforehand, when they're not in the room. Explore the clock and figure out how to work it.
 This can be while they're sleeping, but if they sleep light, try to do this while they're out of the room, right before bed, because they may check it earlier.
 If they typically wake up at 7, set it for two. If their normal wake-up time is four, then set it for midnight. Make it much earlier than when they wake up.

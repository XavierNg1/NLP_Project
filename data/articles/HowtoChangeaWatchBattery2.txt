 There should be small screws on the backside of your watch. These screws keep the back in place. To remove them, use a small screwdriver that you would use for eyeglasses and turn the screws until you can remove them from the watch.Make sure to put the small screws in a safe place, like a ziplock bag, so that you don't lose them.
 Once you remove all of the screws from the back of the watch, the back should easily lift up. This will expose the watch battery and other internal parts in the watch., Once you replace the battery, press the back of the watch back onto the watch and take the small screws that you removed earlier and screw them back into their holes.

 In many countries, you can enter a code before you dial a number and your phone number will be blocked from appearing on the recipient's caller ID. The code varies depending on your country and your service provider, and it is not possible to block in all countries. Enter the prefix, followed immediately by the number you are dialing. For example, if you are in the US and want to call (555)123-4567, you would enter *675551234567.


North America - *67 or #31#

Albania, Australia, Denmark, Greece, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway: #31#

Argentina, Iceland, Switzerland, South Africa: *31*

Germany: *31# or #31#

Hong Kong: 133

Japan: 184

UK and Ireland: 141

New Zealand: 0197 (Telecom) or *67 (Vodafone)
Australia: 1831 or #31#

India: *31# - Must be enabled by network.
If your country is not listed, chances are you can use either *67 or #31#. Most GSM mobile networks work with #31#.;
, If you want all of your phone calls to always be blocked, you can contact your carrier and set up permanent Caller ID blocking. There is typically a charge for this, and the fees and terms will vary from carrier to carrier.


Most pre-paid plans cannot enable permanent Caller ID blocking.
India users need to enable Caller ID blocking before they can use the blocking prefix.
Some people have Anonymous Call Rejection enabled, which means your call will not be able to be completed unless you call from an unblocked number.
If you want to make an unblocked call after setting up a block on all your outgoing calls, you will need to enter the unblocking prefix before the phone number. Some of these include:

Australia: 1832

Ireland: 142

UK: 1470

North America: *82

New Zealand: 0196 (Telecom) or *82 (Vodafone)
Hong Kong: 1357

Japan: 186

Most GSM Networks: *31#

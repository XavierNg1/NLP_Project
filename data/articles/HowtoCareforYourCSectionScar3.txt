 You should get in the habit of checking the incision area daily. Make sure that the incision does not separate. If you notice any bleeding or if the incision has a green or pus-coloured discharge, you should see your doctor immediately.This could signal that your scar has developed an infection.
 When you leave the hospital your incision will feel soft to the touch, but over the next few days you may begin to notice that if feels hard. This is completely normal and is called the healing ridge., Your scar may appear slightly darker approximately one month after delivery. This is normal and the colour will begin to fade. At some point, approximately 6 months to a year after the procedure, your scar will stop changing.


Typically incision scars are small and not noticeable.

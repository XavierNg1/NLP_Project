 Let your new friends know that you care about them by listening actively when they talk to you. Give them your full attention, and try to understand their experiences by stepping into their shoes. If a friend is feeling down, do your best to cheer them up.Many shy people are great listeners, so if you have this skill, make the most of it.
 People want to spend time with others who are positive and uplifting. Get into the habit of looking for the good side of every situation and every person you come across. If you are prone to complaining, tone it down, especially in the early stages of a friendship.You don’t have to act fake or be happy all the time, but a positive mindset will help you attract and keep more friends.
 Let your friendships develop naturally over time. Don’t try to force closeness – you can’t become someone’s best friend in a week. Enjoy the time you spend with your new friends without becoming clingy or needy.For instance, don’t start talking about your deepest personal issues if you’ve only known someone for a week or two.
If you’re not sure how much to talk to your friends, try to mirror their level of involvement in the relationship. For instance, if they text you every day, it’s probably okay for you to text them every day, too.

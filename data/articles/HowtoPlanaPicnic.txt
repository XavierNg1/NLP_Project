 Nearby parks, rooftops, beaches or farmhouse etc. are ideal choices. As a general rule there should be some flat unobstructed area that you can sit on and picnic.;
, Make sure the invitations have your name, the location of the picnic, and the time in which your picnic will take place. Add any additional information to your invitation such as whether your guests are free to bring food, carpooling opportunities, etc. Make sure to include an RSVP number.
 When all your guests have stated whether they are, or are not able to attend your picnic, make a guest list so as to get a general feel of how big your picnic will be.
 Classic picnic foods are (but not limited to): sandwiches, fruits, salads, chips, cookies, hot dogs, pies, vegetables, fruit punch, lemonade, soda, and bottled water. Finger foods are the most comfortable to eat and serve. Remember you can be creative and make your picnic memorable. Try exotic foods such as tapas (bread and dips), olives and cheeses. Visit your local supermarket to get ideas.
 Ice chests are very handy in storing foods. Remember to pack a picnic blanket, paper or plastic cups and plates, forks, knives and spoons, trash bags, and anything else you will need. Paper napkins are a must. Some people even have portable folding picnic chairs and tables.
 Wear something comfortable and if it is hot out wear loose, light clothing. Remember to wear insect repellant and sunblock.
 Be early. However, if you wish for your guests to have a choice in picnic spot, organise a meeting place where people can get together before hunting for the perfect place. Remember to wait for everyone to arrive before you go looking.
 Greet them and enjoy the day.

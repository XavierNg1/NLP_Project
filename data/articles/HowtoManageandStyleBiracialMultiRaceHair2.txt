 Figuring out the perfect styling products and styling methods for your hair is hard, but it can be easier if you look for products that are designed for multiracial hair. Gel is a good product to use while you are still looking for other products, because the gel tames frizziness while making your hair look beautiful.
 Though you can use a flat iron on c hair, a hot comb can loosen your curls.
 If you are going to use a relaxer, don't do it yourself unless you're trained. Instead, do your research and go to a trusted beautician or professional. If you want, you can get a weave, though it may hurt the first time if you haven't gotten cornrows.

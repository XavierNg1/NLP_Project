 Isopropyl alcohol is a powerful cleaning agent, and you can get it for cheap from most grocery stores.


If you don't have isopropyl alcohol, window cleaner will work as well.;
, Avoid touching any of the disc surface.
 Microfiber is very tightly-woven, and is soft to the touch. It will pick up dirt and dust without scratching the disc's surface.Don't use tissue, paper, towels, or cotton to wipe the disc. These materials all pose a scratching risk.
 Rotate the disc and wipe again from the center to the edge. Keep rotating until the entire disc has been wiped.


Wipe straight from the center instead of in circles. Wiping in circles around the disc can increase the risk of scratching., Allow the disc to air dry, but don't place it in direct sunlight. Isopropyl alcohol should only take a few seconds to dry; window cleaner may take a little longer.


Avoid drying with a dry cloth, as this can promote scratching.

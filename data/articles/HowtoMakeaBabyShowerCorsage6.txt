 Use a white or other neutral color of elastic wristband that is covered in gathered fabric or ribbon.


You can either purchase a pre-made wristband or make your own using elastic that is covered with gathered fabric. If you make your own, then cut the elastic the length of the circumference of the wearer’s wrist. Stitch the ends together, making sure that they overlap slightly for maximum comfort and the best appearance.
 Wrapping your bouquet around the wristband seam will hide the seam.
 Tie the bouquet around the seam so that the bouquet is firmly attached.
 This will help to hold the bouquet in place.


You may want to hold the flowers into place while dabbing the hot glue so that you know exactly where the glue should go and avoid burns.
Do not hot glue the flowers when the corsage is on a wrist! This can cause burns!

, Make sure the stem is trimmed as needed so that the wire doesn’t poke into the wearer’s wrist.
 It should rest securely around her wrist. It should be loose enough to be comfortable but tight enough to not fall off.

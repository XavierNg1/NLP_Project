 To make a .bat file, you will have to write plain text in a text editor and save it so that your computer reads this text as executable commands. Notepad or any other basic text editor will work to write a .bat file.
 The following text will open a window with green font, entitled "Hack Window." To change the title, you can change the entry following "title" in your notepad file to your preference. The text "@echo off" hides the command prompt, while "tree" will display a directory tree, making the hacking seem more realistic. The last line of text will ping google's server, which is not illegal yet looks like hacking to the untrained eye. Input the following text into your blank notepad document:


color a
title HACK WINDOW
@echo off
tree
ping www.google.com -t

, When saving your file, you will need to select "Save as." In the prompted dialogue box, name your file and end your name with ".bat". This will change your file from a text document to a batch file. Batch files contain text that gives your computer operating system a series of commands.This might not work on Windows Vista.
You may receive a message warning you that saving a file with a .bat extension will remove all formatting. Click "Yes" to finish creating your .bat file.
 Double click your .bat file in its containing folder to open a window that will look, for all intents and purposes, like you are performing some complex computer process, like a hacker.

 YouTube Red is a premium subscription service offered by YouTube. One of its incentives is an ad-free viewing experience.
,, After the first month, a YouTube Red account is $9.99/month. You should have at least two payment options here:



Add new credit or debit card - Check this option if you want to use a credit or debit card to pay for YouTube Red. Unfortunately, you can't use a prepaid Visa here.

Add new PayPal account - Check this option if you want to use your PayPal account to pay for YouTube Red.

Existing payment option - If you have a card number saved on your Google account, you can select this option to use it by default.
 If you're setting up a new card or PayPal account, you'll need to enter your payment info (e.g., card number or email address).
 Your YouTube Red subscription should begin immediately, complete with an absence of ads.


You may need to exit your browser and re-open YouTube in order for the ads to completely disappear.

 Before your print, think about the purpose of your image. For example, if you're using a transparency in an overhead projector, you pretty much have free reign in what you print. On the other hand, if you're using the transparency for something like screen printing, you need to make sure the image has a clear outline and it's in black and white, to make it easier to print to the screen., When you go to print, you need to change the type of paper you are printing on. Usually, you'll find it under the printing preferences. Look for something like "paper quality" or "paper type." Select "transparencies" under the type of paper.If your printer doesn't have a transparency setting, use the glossy paper setting.
 Once you have everything set up, you print the page as normal. If you're printing in black and white, you may want to set the printing to its darkest setting. That way, it will show the contrast better, whether you're using the transparency for an overhead projector or for screen printing.All you need to do to print is click "File" and "Print." Once under "Print," you can change some settings. However, you may need to go into "Printing Preferences" to change some settings.
 While you can use these transparencies as you would any other transparency, you should realize that one you print at home won't be quite as durable as a professionally printed one. Be careful of your hand oils, and try not to get the transparency wet, as the ink may run.

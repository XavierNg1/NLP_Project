 This is one of the easiest ways to simplify the referral process. Give your client a simple referral email script, so that all they need to do is put in their own name and send it to a couple friends.Your template should include a brief description of your business and what kinds of services you offer.
 Develop a simple referral form that clients can fill out on their phone or computer, and send them the link when you make a referral request.You may be able to get a referral form template from a website like Jotform or Formstack.
Since a lot of people rely heavily on their phones for email and other forms of communication, ideally your form should be mobile friendly.
Make the form shareable over email or social media, if you can.
 Review sites like Yelp and Angie’s List offer a great way for clients to get the word out about your business. Looking at positive reviews from other satisfied clients can also give them ideas about how to put their own experience with you into writing.Put links to your review site pages on your website, and include them in email communications with clients.
Encourage clients to review your business on these sites. Ask them to point potential referrals in the direction of your positive reviews and testimonials online.
 It will be easier for clients to refer you if they can easily provide some informative marketing materials to potential referrals. This could take the form of a brochure, a downloadable PDF, or even a simple referral card with your company’s basic information and a “Referred by _____” form.These materials should aim to provide clear, simple answers to a few very basic questions about your business. In simple terms, describe who you are, what you do, and why the potential referral should choose you.

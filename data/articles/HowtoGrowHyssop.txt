;
, The soil should be light, well drained and with a pH of 6.0 (alkaline).
, Space the seeds about 30cm apart, or thin out the seedlings later.
 Hyssop needs minimal care but does appreciate a little manure and mixed fertiliser in late winter to encourage new growth.
 To avoid scraggly plants, it is important to trim after it finishes flowering and again in late winter.
 While hyssop can withstand very cold temperatures, if subjected to severe winters, hyssop will likely fail to thrive after several years and will need to be replaced.
 This is when the flowers are at their best.
, Some suggestions for use include:


Add the flowers to salads, ice cubes or and use as a garnish; use them in place of violets for sugared/candied flowers
Use the leaves in meat dishes, fish dishes and salads; also good in soups, vegetable bakes, fruit salads and with pulses
Use as a companion plant. If grown near cabbages, it may serve as a decoy plant to keep some of the white cabbage butterflies off the cabbages.
Use in potpourri to impart its fragrance; dried leaves and flowers can be used in potpourri.
Make a tea from hyssop for medicinal purposes, such as helping with coughs and improving digestion. Consult reliable herbal remedy books for directions and contra-indications.
 Dig out, divide gently, then replant both the old and the new plants.



Pull off a healthy shoot without a flower, along with some of its heel (the woody section of the plant).
Make a clean cut across the base of the heel and strip off the lower leaves using a sharp and clean knife.
Dip in hormone rooting powder.
 Plant it so that the soil reaches almost up to the leaves that have been left on, but leave some stem peeking up.


Keep in a cool spot out of direct sunlight as the cuttings take root.
Mist for the first week or so but don't overdo it.
Expect roots to have formed within a month. They can then be left to grow as usual or replanted in the garden.

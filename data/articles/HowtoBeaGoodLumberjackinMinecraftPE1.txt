 An axe will allow you to chop down wood extremely efficiently. There are different types of axes with varying prices and benefits. Decide which axe suits you the best.


Wooden axe: Slow mining, short durability, but a good beginning
Stone axe: Fairly fast mining, average durability, commonly used.
Iron axe: Fast mining, rather long durability, very commonly used
Golden axe: Slow mining, short durability, but it looks very fancy.
Diamond axe: Very fast mining, long durability, it's the best one, but the hardest to craft.;
, Chopping one single tree at the time is a waste, so find a place where there are many trees, whether it is a forest or a jungle.
 Begin with a tree and chop down all the wood by clicking and holding with your axe.
 Besides your chopped down wood, the despawning leaves will give you a variant of different drops, such as apples.
 Continue chopping down trees and collecting drops until the forest is chopped down. If you still need more wood, move on to the next forest.

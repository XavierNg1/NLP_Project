 Even though the terms are often used interchangeably, there is a difference. A lawyer is someone who has trained in the law, usually by attending law school. An attorney is someone who has passed the bar exam and is actively practicing law. If you are writing to a woman who has been to law school, but is not practicing law, for example the manager of a company, address her as you would any other professional. ;
, This traditional salutation is short, to the point, professional, and polite. Showing simple respect and manners puts your best foot forward in your communications.


Modern names have often become unisex. If you are unsure if "Morgan" or "Taylor" is a man or woman and you can't verify it, open your business letter with the attorney's full name, "Dear Morgan Smith:" If you don't have a specific name, avoid worn-out cliches like "To Whom It May Concern." Examples of modern generic salutations include "Dear Sir or Madam," or "Dear Legal Department." Use proper salutations in your email to a female attorney as well.
 Do not use "Ms." on the envelope. For example, "Mary Smith, Attorney At Law." The next line would be the name of her law firm if applicable, then the address. Esquire, or Esq., is also always correct when addressing an envelope to a female attorney. However, it is a dated term that is falling out of common usage. Some consider it pretentious.Attorney At Law is the more modern form of address.
 If you are writing a letter or program for an academic institution and reference either a lawyer or a practicing attorney, follow her name with her degree. You can either use "JD" or "J.D." for Juris Doctor. If the person has an advanced law degree, add that as well. The most common is "LL.M" for a master's degree in law.

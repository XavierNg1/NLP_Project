 You'll need:


11 cups warm water
1 cup clear Dawn detergent
1 cup corn syrup
1/2 cup glycerin.
 Mix together very slowly and mix only lightly.
 Do not shake while pouring.


A milk jug makes an ideal container.
 It will stay good for ages if kept tightly covered.
 Bend a coat hanger or wire into a bubble stick shape, or use a regular large bubble stick blower. Enjoy blowing absolutely enormous bubbles!

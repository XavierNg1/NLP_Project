 Large cans used by restaurants can make great planters. However, be sure to clean the can thoroughly to remove any traces of oil or food products.
 You can file the edges of the cans down, or you can pinch the metal at the edge of the can so that it becomes flat; use metal pliers to do this.


You can also put silicon sealant along the sharp edges.
 Most plants do not like soggy roots, so it is important that your can planters have some drainage holes. To make them:


Use an electric drill, or a hammer and sharp nail. If you use a hammer and nail, turn the can upside down so that the sharp sides of the holes you make face inward.
Consider painting your can. If you do not know how to do that, see the next section.
 In addition to making drainage holes, you should also lay some gravel at the bottom of the can before you put the soil in. The grave will help to improve the canâ€™s drainage.
 Fill the can with soil and pick out plants to fill your can planter with. The plants you choose are up to you; just keep in mind that you should pick out a soil that the plants will do well in. If your plants like acidic soil, make sure that the soil you buy is acidic.

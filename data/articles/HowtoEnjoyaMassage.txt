  Don't feel rushed.  Don't check your watch or the wall clock.  Just let time pass.;
,  It does help.   You'll begin feeling better, as more oxygen floods your tissues.
  If  the therapist is using too much pressure, say something.  Likewise if it's barely noticeable pressure! 

,  Cell phones can really disrupt your peace of mind.  If you leave it nearby and choose not to answer, you may end up tense, wondering who was calling.
  Some therapists just aren't very good at what they do.  Others seem gifted with some sort of helpful, even healing, touch.  If the therapist is nice, but is lousy, move on. 

,  Deep tissue's not for everyone; neither is rolfing.  Trigger Point Therapy is great, but not suited for all people. 

,  And then once she starts, make sure you both are working with the same definitions!  To some, deep pressure means a lot of force.  To others, deep pressure really means less.  Make sure you don't endure a torture session; deep tissue massage may hurt, but it shouldn't hurt so badly that you feel like passing out. 

,  Burn candles.  Play your favorite meditation CD on your home stereo, if it's an at home massage.  If it's at a spa, bring your CD.  They usually have a player.  Some spas have docking stations for iPods, also.
  Focus on one part of your body at a time.
  This is essential.  We all have personal preferences, in terms of people's personalities.  If someone is a good therapist, but their personality grates you, it may be best to move on.  But if they're a great therapist, and they annoy you, it may be best to just endure it.  Great therapists are difficult to find!

, Otherwise, you may spend precious session time up and about, not receiving a massage.

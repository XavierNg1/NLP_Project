 Hand reflexology for weight loss is ideal for people on the go or for those times when it is not possible for you to remove your shoes and socks to give yourself foot reflexology. Refer to the hand chart to locate the key reflex points on your hands that help facilitate weight loss., Locate the exact pressure points on the hand chart for your: spleen (below your little finger on your left hand), digestive organs (below the lung and breast area on both hands), gall bladder (the pad under the little finger on your right hand) and key endocrine glands (middle and base of your thumbs on both hands)., Press deeply, but not so deeply that you feel pain. You will also need to hold the pressure for longer than you would on your foot.Use a single finger or your thumb to apply pressure.
 Move as if you are pressing pins into a pincushion, and maintain permanent contact with your skin. The reflexes in your hands are located in a much smaller area than on your feet, so work slowly and methodically over all the appropriate areas.

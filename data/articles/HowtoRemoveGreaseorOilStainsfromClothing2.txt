 Grease-fighting detergents may be helpful, but are not necessary. You can use shampoo in this manner, as well, it's designed for body oils, so should work effectively in this application. Alternatively, use bar soap, any hand or body bar soap will do (make sure it hasn't got any additives that may hinder its cleaning, i.e. one like Dove would not be suitable), or for very tough grease, look for bars labeled Laundry Soap. Dampen with water (or ammonia for extra grease removal), then rub the bar onto the stain until sufficient soap has transferred to foam up amply. You can also grate the bar soap and apply the resulting powder/pieces onto the stain after wetting.









If using colored detergent, be sure to dilute it or the detergent may stain the clothing.
For stubborn stains, using an old toothbrush will help you attack the stain better than you'd be able to with your hand. Old foot brushes or nail brushes can also serve, as well as small scrub brushes available for cleaning.
 You should see it dissolve. Dish detergents and laundry bar soaps have special agents that fight grease, so does shampoo.
 Vinegar is a natural cleaning agent used in a wide variety of applications, however, it reduces the alkalinity of soaps or detergents, making them less effective, so do not use detergents or soaps along with any vinegar. If you wish, mix one part vinegar with two parts water and soak the article of clothing in the water and vinegar, then rinse out the vinegar and use the detergent/shampoo/soap method as above.
 Follow washing instructions on clothing label exactly.









When ready to dry, allow the clothing to air-dry. Drying in the extremely hot mechanical dryer may cause any lingering oil or grease to set into the clothing.

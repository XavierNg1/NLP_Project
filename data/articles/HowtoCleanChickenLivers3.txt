 If you are in the habit of buying whole chickens, you'll actually be purchasing livers at the same time. Some chickens have multiple hearts and multiple livers, so you might get more than one per chicken.Don't use livers in giblet gravy - it can give the gravy a bitter taste.
 You can buy whole livers from the butcher or the meat department of your local grocery store. These livers tend to be of a better quality than what you'd get in a whole chicken, since the processing of whole chickens means the livers might be mangled.Livers from the grocery store or butcher may come in a jar, or they might be fresh. Ask your butcher how they package them.
 Before you store the chicken livers, you should clean them so that they're ready to be used when you want them. Once you've cleaned them, lay them flat in a freezer storage bag and lay the bag flat in your freezer.Use the livers within three to four months of freezing them.
 The most popular way to prepare chicken livers is by making chopped liver. Melt 5 tablespoons (2.5 ounces) of fat (either chicken fat or butter) in a pan, then sauté 2 cups (16 ounces) of sliced onions in the fat. Remove the onions, but pour the fat back in the pan, and sauté 1 pound of chicken livers until they're brown on the outside and no longer pink on the inside. Mix the livers, onions, and 3 hard-boiled eggs together and chop them finely. Season with salt and pepper and either serve within two hours or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

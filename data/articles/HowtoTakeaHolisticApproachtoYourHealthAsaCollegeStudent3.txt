In college, you’re exposed to so many people. And those people are going to decide to do different things with their time at college. If you’re trying to graduate early and get the best grades possible, hanging out with people who want to Facebook at the library is probably not your best move. But it goes deeper than this.
Surround yourself with people who will make you feel good. Negative people will drag you down as you pursue your goals and that’s not something you need. Don’t be afraid of ending friendships or relationships that are not in line with what you’re trying to accomplish as an individual.



This is key. In college, where so many lines are unfortunately blurred and crossed, it’s important that you as an individual understands what you’re comfortable with.
This doesn’t just refer to intimate relationships, this refers to boundaries of any kind. With professors, friends, colleagues, and roommates.
If you’re not clear with yourself about what you want and need to thrive, then how will anyone else know what you need? They won’t. Setting boundaries and acknowledging what you’re comfortable with is invaluable to your college happiness.

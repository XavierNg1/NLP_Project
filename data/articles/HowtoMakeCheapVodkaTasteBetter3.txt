 The main ingredient in liquor polishing is activated carbon, though adding your carbon to a full container of vodka may cause your container to overflow. You'll also have to strain the carbon out at some point, so you'll need:


Activated carbon (food safe; 3 to 5 cups (375 - 625 g) depending on amount of liquor being polished)
Container (freezer safe)
Funnel
Strainer/colander

, You'll want a container that is larger than your amount of vodka, otherwise, when you add your carbon, you might lose some vodka to overflow. Place your funnel in the container, and pour your vodka from its original vessel into the container.
 Impurities in alcohol, like aldehydes, amino acids, and oils are likely the culprits making your cheap vodka taste foul. Polishing alcohol is the process of soaking it for a length of time in activated carbon to remove these impurities.


Rinse your activated carbon in a colander/strainer under cold water to remove any dust that may have formed on it during the packaging and handling process.
Add 1 cup of food safe activated carbon per every 4 to 5 liters (1 to 1.3 gallons)., At minimum, you should allow your vodka to soak in the activated carbon you’ve added for a week. For even better results, you can allow the vodka to soak for a month, though after a few months you’ll reach the carbon’s limit and see little change in quality.


Shake the vodka in its container for a few minutes every day to ensure the consistently filtration throughout the mixture.
Keep your vodka in a cold location, like your freezer, to make the impurities in it easier for the activated carbon to absorb., A regular kitchen strainer should be sufficient to catch your activated carbon while letting the vodka drain through into a container. You may want to nest your strainer into your funnel so the vodka flows directly down the nozzle of the funnel and into a container, preventing lost liquor.

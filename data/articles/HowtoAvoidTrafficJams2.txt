 The early morning and late afternoon hours are the worst traffic times in most locations, because that is when most people are on the road going too and from work and school. If at all possible, avoid driving during these times. Leaving just a little bi earlier or later can help you steer clear of bumper-to-bumper traffic.
 If you work during the day and have to drive, you still might be able to avoid rush hour. Ask your supervisor if you can change your work shift so that you come in and leave earlier and later to beat traffic.


A more involved change is to work from home, but some employers are open to this idea. Even if you can work from home only one day a week, that means a little less time spent stuck in traffic jams.
 There are real benefits to public transportation, including decreased traffic overall. For you as an individual, it can be a solution for avoiding traffic jams. Modes like rail and subways bypass roads altogether. Even bus routes are usually planned to get people where they need to go efficiently. Sit back, relax, and let someone else do the driving!, If you only have to go a fairly short distance, try not to drive at all. If it’s a walkable distance, there’s no need to get stuck behind the wheel. You can also try biking, especially if there are dedicated bike lanes in your area. This can be more direct and enjoyable that driving.Walking and biking can also be great choices for your health.
In some locations, motorcycles and scooters are allowed to drive between lanes of traffic. If this is allowed in your area, this can be another option for escaping a traffic jam.

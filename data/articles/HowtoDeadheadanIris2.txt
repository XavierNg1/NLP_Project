 Seed production takes your plant's energies away from flower production, so removing the dead flowers at their swollen base prevents seeds from being formed at that site. The plant then often goes on to produce more blooms than it would otherwise have done.


In the case of some varieties of Iris, you may get a second flush of blooms if you deadhead your plants.
 Deadheading also improves the plant’s appearance so that ongoing flower production can be enjoyed. Removing withered brown flowers also improves the plant’s appearance even if it doesn’t produce further flowers.


This is especially true of Iris plants, as the dead flowers turn brown very quickly and detract from other flowers.
 Some plants need to be deadheaded to prevent the plant from self-seeding throughout your garden. Plants such as poppy and ox eye daisy tend to spread themselves by seeding the surrounding area of ground and this may become a nuisance.


Some Iris varieties such as the African Iris (Dietes bicolor) are likely to self seed in your garden. Deadheading these and other plants will stop this from happening and contain the spread of plants in your garden.
 Some Irises have attractive seedheads so you may wish to avoid deadheading in order to enjoy the seedhead display once the flowers are finished.


These varieties include Stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and Blackberry lily (Belamcanda), both of which produce attractive visible seeds after flowering.

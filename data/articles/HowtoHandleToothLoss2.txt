 A dental bridge is a fixed alternative used to replace lost teeth. It has two parts:


A pontic: This is the part that replaces the lost tooth or teeth.
An abutment: This is the part that is placed on and derives support from the teeth adjacent to the space of the missing teeth.
 If the space created by your missing teeth is narrow, a dental bridge could be a good option for you. In addition to this, if the teeth adjacent to the space of missing teeth are strongly held by the gums and underlying bone, you should consider a dental bridge. Weak or loose teeth may not work with a dental bridge. Also:


When you prefer a fixed alternative over a removable one.
If you are suffering from epilepsy and cannot afford the risk of choking if your denture was to fall out during an episode.
If you cannot take care of your personal hygiene for a physical or mental reason.
 The most prominent benefit is that a dental bridge looks and feels natural. It acts just like your natural teeth.


You can also speak and chew without having to worry about changes to your lifestyle.
 It is important to know that the tooth material of healthy strong abutment teeth is shaved off for the installation of the bridge. Also:


There are chances for bacterial proliferation and subsequent gum inflammation under the bridge or area between the gums and bridge. These areas tend to be difficult to clean.

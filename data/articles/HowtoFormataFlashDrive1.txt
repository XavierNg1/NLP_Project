NTFS - The default Windows operating system format. If you're using your drive as a secondary Windows drive, you'll need to choose this option.

FAT32 - The most widely compatible format. Works with most computers and gaming consoles.

exFAT - Similar to FAT32, but designed for external hard drives (e.g., flash drives) and quicker use.
 The option you pick will depend on what you plan on using the drive for. For example, choose FAT32 if you're formatting the flash drive for use with a gaming console, or choose NTFS if you're creating a Windows-only backup drive.

If you've formatted your drive before and you're positive that it isn't broken, you can also check the Quick Format box.

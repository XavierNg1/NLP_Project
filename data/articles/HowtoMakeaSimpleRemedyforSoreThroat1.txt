 Inhaling steam, especially when combined with herbs, is a great way to soothe your throat. To start , put about two inches (about 5 cm) of water in a pot. Put the pot on the stove and turn on the heat.;
, Add 1 teaspoon each of thyme and oregano. Then add just a small pinch of cayenne pepper.


Both thyme and oregano have antibiotic properties.Cayenne pepper has antibacterial properties as well, and helps thin the mucus and to stimulate drainage.Leave out the cayenne if using this treatment on very young children.
Ginger, chamomile, licorice root, and marshmallow root can also be used for steam treatments.
 Let the mixture come to vigorous boil. Then, remove the pot from the heat.
 Drape a towel over your head and the pot. This will help keep the steam from escaping. Then, start taking deep breaths, breathing in the steam through both your nose and mouth.


Keep inhaling the steam for two to four minutes.
You can repeat this four to five times each day.
You can reuse the same liquid several times if you wish. Boiling will destroy any bacteria that might get into the pot.

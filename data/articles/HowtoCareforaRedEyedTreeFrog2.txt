 You will need at least a ten to twenty gallon glass terrarium for your tree frog. This size can accommodate up to four frogs comfortably. Make sure that you have a properly fitting screen-top. This will ensure proper ventilation while keeping everything secure in your frog’s habitat.Pet stores will often sell these terrariums. You will also be able to find them online.
 The material lining the bottom of the cage is called a substrate. For your red-eyed tree frog, you should put down about two or three inches of non-fertilized potting soil. You can mix this soil with bed-a-beast bedding, orchid bark, coco coir, paper towels, or peat moss to give it more texture.The substrate should be scooped out and replaced every two to three months., Your frog will appreciate some items around the cage to climb and hide under. Find some natural, leafy looking furnishings to place in the cage. Make sure that these are non-toxic to prevent damage to your frog's sensitive skin.


Coconut halves make great dens for the frogs.Leaves, driftwood, rocks, cork, and branches can give your frog something to climb and explore.You can put in both fake and living plants, but fake plants are easier to keep alive.
 During the day, the cage will need to be between 78 and 84 degrees F (25 and 28C). At night, the temperature can drop no more than ten degrees. If your room temperature is cooler than this, you may have to invest in heaters for your terrarium. There are several options for heating the terrarium:


Low wattage heat bulbs can attach to the screen top. They provide enough heat without burning your frogs.
Heat pads can rest beneath the cage. Look for ones specially designed for reptiles at your pet store.Be warned that if water touches the hot glass, it can crack the glass.Red or nocturnal bulbs can be left on all night to ensure around the clock warmth.Red-eyed tree frogs are nocturnal so extra lighting isn’t necessarily. Bulbs would simply provide warmth.

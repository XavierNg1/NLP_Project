 If you have a top-oven broiler, move the top rack so that it's 3 to 5 inches from the broiler. Turn the broiler on to hi and let it heat for about 10 minutes. Generously salt and pepper both sides of your pork loin steaks. You could also sprinkle them with:Ground fennel
Garlic powder
Onion powder
Ground cumin

, Cover a baking or roasting pan with foil so that it's easier to clean up. Set the seasoned pork loin steaks on the foil and place the pan under the broiler. Broil the steaks for 6 to 8 minutes. Keep in mind that thinner steaks will cook quicker while thicker steaks may take longer.If your steaks are more than 1 1/2 inches thick, consider broiling them 4 or 5 inches away from the heat source. This will prevent the outside from burning before the inside has a chance to cook.
 Carefully use tongs to flip the pork loin steaks over on the baking pan. Place the steaks back under the broiler and continue to broil them for another 6 to 8 minutes or until the steaks are golden brown.Remember to wear oven mitts and use caution when pulling the baking pan out of the oven.
 Once the pork loin steaks have browned on both sides, remove the pan and check the internal temperature of the steaks. The steaks should be between 145 degrees F (60 C) and 160 F (70 C) before you let them rest. Let them rest for 5 minutes before you serve them.Resting the steaks helps relax the muscle so the juices evenly distribute.

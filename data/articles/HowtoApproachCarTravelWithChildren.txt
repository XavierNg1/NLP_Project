 A great alternative to books for children who suffer from motion sickness, audio books and even favourite music or nursery rhyme CD’s can help to keep your children amused while travelling. If you have a CD player, and your children are of an appropriate age to use one, then allow your child to listen through headphones to avoid distractions. This also makes younger children feel quite grown up and the novelty factor is a winner. You can get adapters to allow for two sets of earphones if required. Always ensure that the volume is kept low.;
, Allow your child to pack a little bag with some of their favourite things for the journey. Give them some freedom with this so that it feels exciting and encourage them to include items like; A book, a much loved cuddly toy, travel ‘Etch a Sketch', magnetic travel games, a pack of ‘top trumps', a word search book and highlighter pen

,, This can be a fun item for children who wish to be involved in the navigation! Slightly older ‘happy helpers’ could also have a printed out map of the route, allowing them to tick off towns as you progress on your journey.
 Stocking up at garages can be expensive! Water is advised as sugary drinks will probably lead to higher consumption and therefore more toilet stops (not to mention the excess energy they will provide). Let you children help to make a box of snacks for the journey including items like carrot batons, breadsticks, string cheese, dried fruit and cereal bars. Also take some wipes and a rubbish bag!

, For long journeys a headrest and maybe a lightweight blanket can ensure that your child is more comfortable and likely to take a nap rather than repeatedly ask “are we there yet?”

, You should allow for an opportunity to stretch your legs on long journeys and spending half an hr doing something active with your children during that time can be a really good idea!

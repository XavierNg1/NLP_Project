 You can look online or in a textbook to find the relationship between nanometers and meters. The relationship between the two units is:1 meter = 1,000,000,000 nanometers (nm)
;
, Recall that any fraction in which the numerator and denominator are equal has an overall value of 1. This is useful, because you can use the conversion fraction to change units without changing the value of the measurement. When you begin with nanometers and want to convert to meters, you will use the following conversion factor:1 meter1,000,000,000 nm{\displaystyle {\frac {1{\text{ meter}}}{1,000,000,000{\text{ nm}}}}}

This is the fraction to convert from nanometers into meters. If you want to begin with meters and convert to nanometers, you just need to flip the fraction upside down.
 To convert from one unit to another, you need to set up a simple multiplication equation. You begin with your initial measurement and multiply it by the conversion factor. The result will be your answer.Remember that you can cancel units that appear once in a numerator and once in a denominator. This is the purpose of the conversion fraction. Your original measurement begins with nanometers, and the conversion fraction has nanometers in the denominator. Thus, the units of nanometers will cancel, and what remains will be the answer in meters.

For this conversion, suppose you have measured a germ that is 2,600 nanometers wide. The conversion equation will be:


2,600 nm=2,600 nm∗1 meter1,000,000,000 nm{\displaystyle 2,600{\text{ nm}}=2,600{\text{ nm}}*{\frac {1{\text{ meter}}}{1,000,000,000{\text{ nm}}}}}




, If your conversion factor is correct, the final step should be a simple multiplication. Finish the conversion as follows:2,600 nm=2,600 nm∗1 meter1,000,000,000 nm=0.0000026 m{\displaystyle 2,600{\text{ nm}}=2,600{\text{ nm}}*{\frac {1{\text{ meter}}}{1,000,000,000{\text{ nm}}}}=0.0000026{\text{ m}}}

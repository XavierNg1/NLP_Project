 It's pretty much what it sounds like. Humans are allergic to the (very small) amounts of saliva that lice inject into the skin in order to retrieve blood.If you have intense itchiness in your scalp area, check for head lice.
 These sores can sometimes become infected with bacteria normally found on a personâ€™s skin.
 These bumps are caused when the lice farm blood from your scalp. They may ooze or become crusty.

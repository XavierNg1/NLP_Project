 Having a tentative quit-by date can be motivating and give your boyfriend something to focus on, but it shouldn’t be set in stone. If he wants to set a date, make sure he knows that he has not failed if he hasn’t fully quit by this time., Many people will experience things like insomnia, inability to concentrate, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, and depression. These usually go away in a week or two. By reminding your boyfriend that they are temporary, you’ll help him believe that he can get through them., Many people take several attempts to quite smoking. If your boyfriend has a relapse, encourage him to learn from the experience so that next time he can avoid whatever caused him to smoke next time. Smoking is a learned behavior, and so is quitting., Relapses can be frustrating, so demonstrate to your boyfriend that it is only a matter of time before he tries again—and before he succeeds. In fact, most people who quit smoking and then have a relapse try again soon.

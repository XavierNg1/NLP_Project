 Place a mat on the floor and get on your hands and knees. Your arms should be straight and your hands should be positioned underneath your shoulders. Then straighten out your legs and ground your toes into the floor. Now you are in a high plank position.Your feet should be slightly apart in the position.
 Doing this will ensure that your back remains straight as you do your push ups. If not, then make sure your back is straight. You do not want your bottom to be sagging or sticking up in the air., Slowly lower yourself to the ground until your elbows are bent at a 90-degree angle. As you lower yourself, do not look straight down. Instead, focus your eyes on a point about two to three feet ahead of you. This will help keep your neck in a neutral position.As you lower yourself to the ground, make sure your elbows are tucked close to your sides.
Breathe in as you lower yourself to the ground.
 Do this once your elbows hit the 90-degree angle. Slowly push back up to the starting position. Congratulations, you just completed one push up! Start with three sets of five to eight push ups. Practice this three times a week.Remember to keep your back straight as you push up.
Exhale as you push back up.

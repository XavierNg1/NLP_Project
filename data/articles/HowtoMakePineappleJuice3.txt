 Make sure your juicer is clean before use and always follow instructions. Load your juicer until it's full or you have run out of pineapple.
 Press your chunks down with the lid of your juicer and turn the juicer on. Make sure to hold the lid down and apply gentle pressure until your pineapple chunks go through the juicer.
 Pour your juice from your fruit juicer and enjoy. Because fruit juicers are so efficient, your juice should come out very thin and pure with little need of straining.

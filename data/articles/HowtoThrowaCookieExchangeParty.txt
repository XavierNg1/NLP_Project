 Invite friends and neighbors that love baking as much as you do. Be sure to make it very clear that they need to bring a type of cookie to share with everyone. Send invites out 2 weeks before your party.;
, If you have more than 10 people attending, ask your guest to bring a half dozen cookies per person. If you have less than 10 people attending, ask your guest to bring a full dozen cookies per person. When you do this, you make sure everybody has a chance to taste all the cookies.
 Advise your guests to bring plastic containers to take their cookies home to share. It is also a good idea to ask your guest to bring duplicates of their recipes in case other guest are interested.
 Be sure to store them in an air-tight container until the day of your party. Avoid the temptation to devour your cookies before the cookie exchange party.
 Be sure to have a decorative tablecloth. Place pens and place cards on the table. This way, everyone knows what kind of cookies they are and who baked them. Be sure that the cook provides information about whether or not cookies contain peanuts and dairy, for some guest may be allergic.
 Some good ideas for refreshments are coffee, tea, water, and milk. If your cookie exchange party is being held near the holidays, you can serve hot chocolate or spiced tea. Next, you can relax and enjoy other people's cookies.

 Many dog parks and pet care facilities have an air lock, or second gate that dogs must get through before they can get out. This ensures that a dog cannot take off running if he happens to make it through the first gate.If your dog tends to unlatch or push open one of your gates, then you may want to install a small portion of fencing and a second gate so that you can stop him and bring him back into the yard if he get out of the first gate.
 If your yard is not fenced in, then take your dog out on a leash or put her on a lead when she is out in the yard. Some people attach leads to lines that extend the length of the yard so that the dog can run. No matter how you keep your dog in the yard, make sure that you monitor your dog and do not leave her out for too long.


If you have a big dog that tends to pull on her leash, then try using a front-clip harness to help you maintain control of her. Front-clip harnesses help to keep your dog focused on you and stops her from pulling.
 Some people use electric shock collars with an invisible fence system to prevent their dogs from going beyond the yard's boundaries. These collars work by emitting a sound and then delivering a shock if your dog goes beyond a certain point in your yard. The shock levels range from a mild sensation that is similar to a tickle to a painful jolt.There are moral and welfare issues to consider before using an electric fence. Used incorrectly, they can cause the dog to be unduly fearful and/or cause physical harm to the dog. Also, a court of law does not regard an electric fence as a suitable barrier, and if your dog bites a person who comes onto your property or escapes off it, you will be held culpable because there wasn't an adequate barrier in place.


An electric shock collar might be a good option if you do not have a fence.
Never use an electric shock collar as a training device.
Check your dog's neck often if you use an electric shock collar. They can cause redness and irritation.

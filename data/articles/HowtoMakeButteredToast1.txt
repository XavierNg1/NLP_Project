 Any bread works for buttered toast: white, brown, wheat, sourdough, rye, pumpernickel, or another variety. Each one will give you a slightly different flavor and/or texture, so pick your favorite.


Making bread in the toaster is perhaps the faster and easiest way to make bread. Use this method if you are pressed for time.;
, Your toaster probably offers options for how dark and crisp you want the toast to be. If you're not sure, start with a light setting; you can always put the toast in for a second round to get darker, but you can't do anything about toast that's become too dark.
 When your toast is done, take it out of the toaster. If you think it's dark enough before it actually finishes the toasting cycle, pop it up manually to save it from burning.
 Use a butter knife to spread butter over the toast while it is still warm. If you wait until the toast has cooled, the butter will not melt into the bread. Cut the bread into halves or quarters before you eat, if you wish.


Lots of butter will likely make your toast softer as it melts, and less butter will keep your snack more crisp and dry. The amount of butter used is based on personal preference.
Soften the butter before spreading it on your toast. Take it out of the refrigerator 20 minutes before you plan on making toast to help it warm to room temperature. Whipped butter may also work for this. If you're using a stick of butter and don't have time to soften it, cut the butter into thin slices and apply to warm toast. Thicker slices won't melt as well.

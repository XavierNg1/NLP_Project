If they are just beginning to smell, the ultraviolet rays and fresh air may be all they need.Even if it doesn’t totally solve the problem, it’s a good idea to make sure your sandals are totally dry before you try cleaning them.
 Highly concentrated alcohol can help eliminate unwanted odors. Wet a couple paper towels with rubbing alcohol (they should be damp, but not soaking wet), and drape them over the parts of your sandals that come into contact with your feet. Let them sit for a couple hours, or until the paper towels dry out., Like rubbing alcohol, this can help neutralize bad smells. Put a little bit of vodka in a spray bottle, and mist your sandals with it. Let them air dry in the sun for several hours., This substance is highly effective at absorbing all sorts of unwanted odors. Put your Rainbow sandals in a 1 gallon (3.8 L) ziplock bag, and pour in a half cup of baking soda. Seal the bag and shake it vigorously, coating the sandals thoroughly. Leave them in there for a couple days before you remove them.It may take a little effort, but you should be able to get all the baking soda off your shoes by banging them together and wiping them off with a clean rag.

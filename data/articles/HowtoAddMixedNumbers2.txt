 You can do this by multiplying the denominator and whole number of a mixed number, and then adding this to the numerator of the fraction of the mixed number. Your answer will be the new numerator while the denominator remains the same.


To convert 1 1/2 to a mixed number, multiply the whole number 1 by the denominator 2, and then add it to the numerator. Put your new answer over the original base.

1 * 2 = 2, and 2 + 1 = 3. Place the answer 3 over the original denominator and you have 3/2.


To convert 2 3/4 to a mixed number, multiply the whole number 2 by the denominator 4. 2 * 4 = 8.

Next, add this number to the original numerator and place it over the original denominator. 8 + 3 = 11. Put 11 over 4 to get 11/4.
 The LCM is the lowest number that is evenly divisible by both numbers. If the denominators are already the same, skip this step.


If one of the denominators is divisible by the other, the larger denominator is the LCM. The LCM of 2 and 4 is 4 because 4 is evenly divisible by 2.
 You can do this by finding equivalent fractions. Multiply the denominator by a number that will give you the LCM as the product. Multiply the numerator by the same number. Do this with both fractions.


Since the denominator of 3/2 has to be multiplied by 2 to get the new denominator of 4, you should multiply the numerator by 2 to find the equivalent fraction of 3/2. 3 * 2 = 6, so the new fraction is 6/4.
Since 11/4 already has the denominator of 4, you're in luck. You don't have to change it.
 Now that the denominators are the same, just add the numerators to get your answer while keeping the same base.


6/4 + 11/4 = 17/4.
 Since the original problem was in mixed number form, you can convert it back into a mixed number. Here's how to do it:


First, divide the numerator by the denominator. Divide 4 into 17. 4 goes into 17 4 times, so the quotient is 4. The remainder, or the number that is left over, is 1.
Make your quotient the new whole number. Take your remainder and place it over the original denominator to finish converting the improper fraction into a mixed number. The quotient is 4, the remainder is 1, and the original denominator was 4, so the final answer is 4 1/4.

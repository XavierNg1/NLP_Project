 In all the games, you have a Lost and Found station manned by a dog. In Animal Crossing, it’s found in the Police Station (like the town store, it is located randomly in each town); and in City Folk and Wild World, it’s stationed in the Gate, at the very back of the town. In New Leaf, you need to build it as a Public Works Project once a random Villager requests it, and costs 264,000 Bells., Every now and then you can approach the dog and inquire if there are any items in the Lost and Found. If the dog replies that there are items, you can choose to pick and take items in the Lost and Found inventory without consequence, since the items are randomly generated and don’t actually belong to anyone.

In all games preceding New Leaf, the dog manning the Lost and Found is a mournful-looking and shy dog named Booker. In New Leaf, you could choose between Booker and Copper (a more confident-looking dog) when creating the Police Station as a Public Works Project by picking if you want a Modern or a Classic Police Station when building it. A Modern Police station has Copper manning it, while the Classic one has Booker.
In New Leaf, to build a Police Station you need a Villager to request it and costs 264,000 bells.
 In New Leaf, you can also look for lost items scattered around town. They look like a mitten, a paper bag with a bear stamp, a book, or a blue bag with yellow string. If you return it to the owner before the day is done, they will reward you with fruit, a picture of themselves, clothes, Bells, or furniture! So be neighborly and give back those items!

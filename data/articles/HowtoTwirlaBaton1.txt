 A baton has three parts: the ball, shaft, and tip. The ball is the bigger end of the baton. The shaft is the baton’s metal or plastic middle section. The tip is the baton’s smaller end.These three terms are frequently used to describe hand position and twirls.;
, When choosing a baton, it is very important that you select the correct size. Using a baton that is the wrong size, increases your risk of slip-ups and injuries.


Stand straight and extend one arm in front of yourself parallel to the floor.
Ask a friend to measure from the base of your neck to the tip of your middle finger.
Purchase a baton that is made for a person with your measurement.
If you are unusually small or tall, remove or add 1 to 2 inches to the measurement.
If you are in between sizes, purchase the next size up.
Batons come in 1 inch increments.
 Before you can twirl a baton, you must learn how to hold one. Stand straight with your dominant arm along your side. Wrap your four fingers around the center of the baton’s shaft—the ball should be in front of you. Place your thumb along the top of the shaft—it should point towards the ball. Raise your arm 45° with your palm facing up. The shaft should be parallel to the floor.Occasionally, a specific twirl may require that you hold the baton with your thumb facing the tip.

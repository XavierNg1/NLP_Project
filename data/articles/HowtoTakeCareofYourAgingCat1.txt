 Some older cats tend to experience a decrease in their eyesight or hearing as they age. This may mean that your formerly agile cat will bump into things if they are stacked up around your house. Removing clutter will help an elderly cat to navigate it more easily., Keeping items in your home in their usual spots will allow an older cat to find them easily. For example, try to maintain the cat's sleeping and eating areas in the same place. This is especially important for cats that are losing their sight. Having items in your house in a reliable location will help a blind cat move through its home without bumping into things.


If you move, keep its old blankets, sleeping baskets, and food bowls to restore a sense of normalcy in the new house.
You may also want to keep a light on during the night so that your cat can find its way around the house. If a cat's eyesight is fading, it will not be able to see in the dark as well as it once did., While a young, agile cat may be able to climb or jump to get its needs met, an older cat shouldn't have to. For example, the cat's litter box, food and water dishes, cat bed, and your bed (if the cat likes to sleep there) should be easily accessible to the cat.You can buy little steps for your cat to help it climb onto your bed or wherever it likes to sleep. However, in many cases you can just arrange your furniture to provide this extra step.
 Remember that older cats are more likely to "miss" when using the litter box. Put its litter box on a plastic sheet or simply put it in an area that is easy to clean. That way, if the elderly cat misses the box or tracks litter out of the box, the mess can be cleaned up easily.


If you have the room, try putting the litter box in a small plastic swimming pool with a hole cut in the front. This will allow your cat to get in to do its business while containing its mess in something that can be easily cleaned.

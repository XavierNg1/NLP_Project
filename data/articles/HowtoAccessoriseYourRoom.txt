 If possible, try not to go for a theme. You like lots of different things,so your room revolving around just one thing will only make things difficult! An idea is to have a base colour, namely on your walls, and other colours around your room. Make a plan of the way your furniture will be laid out too. If you want a theme go for a theme that covers a lot of different interests. Ex: Get a modern bedspread and light then decorate with silver and blue.;
, A sunny kinda girl? Maybe yellow or creamy white suits you best. Outgoing and confident? A light green or blue is for you. Girly and creative? Pink or purple?!

,, Some examples are:


Music
Art
Films
Animals, etc.
 It will come in handy later!

, Find good positions and make sure none of your furniture covers anything you want to see, i.e., a window. Empty stuff like desks and drawers before moving. Lay contents on bed and put back when finished. Donate anything you don't want to the charity shop and throw away anything which is too mucked up to keep. Empty your bin,too.
 It may sound boring but can actually be fun if you think positive and how great your room will look afterwards! Dust, wipe, vacuum...do anything you can.
 The fun part! Find a brilliant duvet, curtains, cushions...anything to give your room that relaxed and cozy feel. Change your sheets if necessary.
 Put make up and hair stuff on drawers and your stationary and files on your desk,or in the drawers if you have any in them.
 Use shelves and storage to contain everything! How about displaying all your collections too? Put all your books on bookshelves. How about some teddies on a nearby shelf? Get organized.
 Put up your fave posters and frame photos. Use a noticeboard for reminders and show your favourite art. Put up pics of your fave music stars (look at your list for inspiration). Get a fountain light or fairy lights to make your room magical. Use your imagination and add anything else!

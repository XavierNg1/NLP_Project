 As stated above, your skin can get damaged and form acne when it becomes very dry. To keep your skin hydrated, try to drink plenty of water. Try to drink at least 8 to 12 glasses of water each day, and consider drinking more if you are very active.


If you get bored with regular water, try adding some fruit juice to your glass to give your water some flavor., Certain foods, like the ones listed in the substep of this step, are primarily made up of simple sugars. Simple sugars can elevate your blood sugar levels, which in turn creates a demand for insulin, even if your body doesnâ€™t really need it. These excess levels of insulin can make your skin produce more oil and grow pore-clogging cells, leading to pimples. Foods that are primarily made up of simple sugars include:


Saturated fats like butter and fried food.
Soda.
Refined bread.
Sugar.
White rice.
 Exercising is an important way to keep your body, including your skin, healthy. If you can, try to exercise for at least 30 minutes, three to five days a week. Doing this will keep you in shape and will keep your body functioning properly. Try to do both cardiovascular exercises and strength and flexibility exercises.Examples of cardio exercises include walking, biking, running, hiking, and swimming.
Examples of strength and flexibility training include weightlifting, yoga, and stretching.
 Stress can cause you to break out. Stress can make your body produce more cortisol. Cortisol has been linked to acne breakouts so if you are concerned about adult acne, try to limit the amount of stress you experience each day.


Get plenty of sleep each night. By getting 7 or 8 hours of sleep a night, you will be well rested and prepared to take on the challenges of the day.

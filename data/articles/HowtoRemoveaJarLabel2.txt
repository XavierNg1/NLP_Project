 Make sure that the water is deep enough to completely submerge your jar on its side. If you are removing the label from multiple jars, make sure that the water is deep enough to completely submerge the largest jar.
 Swish the water with your hand to help it dissolve., Let water get inside the jar so that it weighs it down.You don't have to wait exactly 30 minutes, but you have to wait long enough for the water to soak the label and dissolve the glue.
 The label should slide off easily. If you see any residue, try to rub it off with your finger first. If it doesn't come off easily, move on to the next step.
 If there is any residue, put some washing soda onto a scrubby sponge, and gently buff the residue.
 Your jar will be clean, but there might be some washing soda residue on it. Once you have the label off, rinse the jar using clean water, and then pat it dry with a towel.

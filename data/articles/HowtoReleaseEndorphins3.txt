 This is a quick, effective, and long-lasting way to increase your production of endorphins. All types of exercise cause endorphins to be released into your bloodstream, considerably improving your mood.While the famous "runner's high" that marathoners feel is a worthy prize to reach for, you don't have to be a seasoned athlete to reap the benefits of exercise. You can release endorphins by doing any of the following activities:


Walking, hiking, jogging, biking, or swimming
Team sports like softball, basketball and soccer
Gardening, yard work, cleaning

, Pairing physical activity and social connection can stimulate extra endorphin production. When you're doing something with a group of people, the energy level is higher and more endorphins are released. Try signing up for group class in one of the following activities:


Dance of any kind
Zumba
Kickboxing, karate or another martial art
Pilates or yoga

, For a real rush, try activities that stimulate your “fight or flight” response.While it's not practical to think of daredevil activities as an everyday way to boost your mood, it's something to keep in mind when you're looking for an exciting new activity to try. Here are a few daredevil activities that'll give you a rush:


Skydiving
Bungee jumping
Hang gliding
Roller coasters

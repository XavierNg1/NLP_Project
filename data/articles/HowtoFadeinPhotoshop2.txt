 As in the section above, start by selecting "Open" from the File menu and browsing for the image on your hard drive.
 As noted above, Photoshop won't let you move the image in your background layer by default. To "unlock" your image, either use the trick in the section above or try double-clicking on the image itself.
 To create a layer underneath your former background layer, ctrl+click on the New Adjustment Layer button (command+click on Macs). Choose the "Solid Color" fill layer type.


The New Adjustment Layer button looks like a small circle that is half white, half black.
Note that the color in the foreground will be the one used for the new layer. You can change the foreground color with the Color Picker tool.Aesthetically, fades to colored backdrops usually look best if the color used appears in the image itself. The eyedropper tool can help here by allowing you to lift colors directly out of the image., Now that you have an image on one layer and a solid-colored backdrop, it's relatively simple to fade from one to the other. Simply use the gradient tool (with a black-and-white gradient selected), hold shift, and drag a line from where you want your fade effect to start to where you want it to end (as in the section above.)


As also mentioned above, you may want to reposition your image in its layer to get the desired effect.

 The last thing a soldier can do is to have a Suspension of Favorable Action (FLAG) on your record. This type of action is given to soldiers who have not conformed to military standards, (ie. fail a Physical Fitness Test, have done a punishable crime, etc).
 This date should be a special date for you. Be warned, if you decide to place your date further into the future, you run the risk of having things happen. (see #1)

, Do not accept anything Handwritten or White-out. Question anything that seems odd to you. The Army expects 100% success from you, you best expect 100% success from them too. THIS IS YOUR LIFE.
 The Ceremony must be within reasonable travel and convenient for you and the witnesses. Some ceremonies are given at their place of duty or at some places, unusual areas. (See video for an example of Unusual places.)

, The oath must be given by a commissioned officer. It can be given to your Platoon Leader (a 2nd LT) to a General Officer (ie. Army 4 star General). If you choose someone higher than your immediate Chain of Command, I suggest you plan in advance with a letter to the commission officer. Make sure you have a back-up plan, too.
 If you choose to have your Class A uniform, be sure your uniform is pressed and correct. This is your time to shine.

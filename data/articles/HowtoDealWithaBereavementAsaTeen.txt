 Crying is good for you. It helps you let go of some of the hurt or anger you may have. You shouldn't feel weak or silly while crying. After all this shows that you loved the person and that they were important to you.;
, This could be a parent or guardian, your best friend or if you are religious, a pastor or priest. Talking about the one you loved can help you remember all the good memories you have had with them.
 Listen to their favorite songs, look at pictures, read their favorite poem, plant their favorite flower in your garden. This is a good thing as it means you still have a small part of them with you.
 This is a common reaction to the death of a loved one, but remember they wouldn't want you to blame yourself.
 Remember that they are more peaceful, and there is no more hurt or pain were they are now.
 This can bring some comfort as you can take care of their grave site. If you do not like visiting a resting place it does not mean you are a bad person, they would understand that maybe you don't want to remember them that way.
 Sometimes it can sound silly but if you are religious or even if you aren't this can bring a lot of comfort as you feel closer to the person, you can talk to them and ask them to watch over you and keep you safe.
 Time on your own can help you get your thoughts together. Sitting in silence for a while can be quite comforting and can help you feel better.
 Do not let other people tell you how to remember the one you loved. Remember them however you want. Your love for them could have been different than others.
 They always will and by feeling pain this shows you also loved the person.
 Say it however you want. Scattering the remains in a place they loved can bring some closure, also having a service can help you say goodbye.

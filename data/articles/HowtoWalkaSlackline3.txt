Surf the line.
Mount the line on your knees.
Start from a sitting position (sitting on your foot which is on the line) and standing up. Then repeat sitting down.
Yoga positions. This is hard. Do it slowly and maintain control.
Jump forward on the line. Switch from one foot to the other. 180's, 360's.
Do cartwheels.
Hula hoop while you slackline.

Juggle while you slackline.
Back flip off the line. This trick is easier than it looks. Practice on a trampoline first. Once you get that down, try it as a dismount, then try to land a back flip on the line.

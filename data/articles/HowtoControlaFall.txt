Put your arms around the person. Get behind the person if you can.
 Keep your arms around them, but do not try to hold them up.,

Let them fall back against you. Take a stable stance with your knees slightly bent and one foot in front of the other. Take the weight of the person against your body, but do not attempt to hold them up., Remain standing, but allow the person to slide to the floor. If you can, guide the fall away from hard objects (tables, edges of counters) or other obstructions that could injure the person on the way down. Don't try to hold on or hold the person up.,

Support and protect the head. Do what you can to keep the person's head from hitting anything, either on the way down or when they are on the floor., Kneel down next to or behind the person, and do what you can to keep the person calm and comfortable. A pillow or rolled-up shirt will help. If the person is disoriented, discourage them from standing up.,

Call for help. Call emergency services immediately, unless you are certain the person is in no danger. If someone has fallen and you're not sure why, don't hesitate to call and explain the situation, anyway., Tell emergency responders as much as you can about what happened. Mention that you controlled the fall, and say whether you think any injury might have resulted from the fall., At the very least, check that the person is breathing and take appropriate steps to keep their airway clear.

If you think someone has vomited or may vomit as a result of whatever made them fall, ease them onto their side, or, if you need to, use your fingers to clear their airway.

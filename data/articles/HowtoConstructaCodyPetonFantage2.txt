You will see a large billboard sign, with the words "Pet Games" written on it. Click on it. You will get a menu of five games; play any game you prefer.

If you win a certain(random) amount of times, you will get either a ball of yarn, fabric, or stardust in pink, purple, or blue. Click "OK". This item is now in your acsessory inventory, and can be worn anywhere in Fantage.
 Continue until you have reached three of each item for one color. You can check your progress by clicking on the machine next to Cody(in Pet Town). If you have done this, you can construct a cube.


You will need three cubes to make Cody. In addition to getting items, this method will help you and your pet level up (after ten wins).

 Get either a one 9 x 13" pan or two 9" round pans. Use grease or non-stick spray and lightly dab a little around the pans. Also, sprinkle a little flour on top of the grease.;
, Place the unsweetened chocolate and butter into the pan. Melt the two ingredients together and then cool it on the side.
 You'll want to get a light coloring result. Pour in the melted chocolate mixture. Be aware that the heat of the chocolate may cook the eggs, if you're not careful, so beat everything well. Pour in the water and blend that in well with the rest of the ingredients. At this stage, the mixture should be very liquidly.
 Little at a time, add this dry mixture to the chocolate one. Blend and fold in the flour mixture well before adding in more. This method works better because dumping it in all at once may make a mess and longer for the ingredients to incorporate with each other.
 Mix this and add this into the chocolate mix.
 Place pans in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 °F (177 °C).

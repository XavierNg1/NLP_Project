 Try not to ask him too personal questions, as it might make him feel uncomfortable.;
, If his friends are your friends too, it gives you a reason to be around him.
 Guys love it, but try not to make too much eye contact. It might make him feel like he's under a microscope.
, Guys hate it when you try to be someone you're not. They can totally tell when that's happening. They like it better when you're yourself.
 Don't overdo anything.
, Be happy with your look and just go for it.
, Like schoolwork. If you get bad grades, he might think you're way too unfocused. Some guys don't like that.
 Let him talk to you or go a day or two without talking to him. If you sit at home waiting for him to get online and send him a message right away he may think your being too clingy and creepy. Just resist talking to him for a while or wait for him to make the move.
 Either he eventually will, or he's done talking or doesn't want to talk. Wait until a couple hours or a day later to send him a "Hey" or wait for him to talk to you.

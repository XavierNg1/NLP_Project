 Many churches that welcome gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals use the terms "Welcoming Church" or "Affirming Church" in their marketing materials.;
, There is no standard definition for exactly what a welcoming or affirming church is. Some affirming churches do not consider homosexuality to be a sin, while others may welcome gays in worship but do not recognize gay marriage or allow gay members to hold leadership positions in the church. The definition and use of welcoming and/or affirming may be set at a denominational level or by an individual church, which accounts for the variances in the terminology.
 Because of the diverse understandings of the terms welcoming and affirming, the best way to discern whether the church is truly gay-friendly is to contact the church directly and have a conversation with the pastor or other church leaders.

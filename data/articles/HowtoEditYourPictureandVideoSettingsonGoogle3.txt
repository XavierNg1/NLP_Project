 Now you can edit how Google+ treats your pictures and videos. Google+ can automatically enhance every photo and video you upload. You have three options to choose from:


Off
Normal
High
Each option has a bubble beside it, and you can click the option that suits you.
 This is the option below Auto Enhance. This option will let Google+ creature new images, movies, and stories by using your photos and videos. It is also a box that you can check or uncheck by clicking on it.
 You can pick to add people from your circles to a list of people that can tag you in their photos.


This setting is optional.
To add a group, click on the Your Circles button and select the circles you wish to add.
When youâ€™re done, your settings will automatically save.

 If you’d like to make your hermit crab a snack (in addition to his daily meal), it is as easy as a quick trip to your local health food store. You will want a store with a bulk section (such as Whole Foods), this way, you can buy just a little bit of each item, and it will be inexpensive for you., You can make a hermit crab snack from a mix of unsalted nuts, whole grains, unsweetened dried fruits, and seeds. You may also want to include nutritional yeast for added B vitamins. You only need a little bit of each item (1/4 cup or less).Nuts: pistachios, walnuts, or almonds.
Grains: oats, wheat bran, wild rice, or amaranth.
Dried fruits: mango, goji berries, pineapple, coconut, or raisins.
Seeds: pumpkin, chia, or sesame.
Choosing unsalted and unsweetened varieties is very important because table salt and processed sugar can be harmful to your crab.
 If you do not have access to a health foods bulk section, or if you just want to make the most of what you already have, take a look in your pantry at home. Look for any of the food items above, or for other healthy options.Look for oats, granola, whole grain crackers, raisins, or nuts.
Once again, read labels to watch out for added table salt or sugar.
 Take all the dry foods you have purchased or found in your pantry, and mix them all together. If using granola or whole grain crackers, crumble them up or use crumbs from the bottom of the bag.Since these foods are not considered perishable, you can place some of this food in the “crabitat” and allow it stay for 3-4 days, or until your hermit crab finishes it.

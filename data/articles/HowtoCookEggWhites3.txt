 Lightly coat the bottom and sides of a 2-cup (500-ml) microwave-safe cooking dish with nonstick cooking spray.The exact dish should vary depending on how you want to serve the eggs. To make an egg white patty, use a dish with a diameter of about 6 inches (15 cm). To make scrambled egg whites, use a large microwave-safe mug, ramekin, or other bowl.
 Place the egg whites in the prepared dish, followed the salt, pepper, tomato, and feta cheese. Stir to combine.


The tomato and feta cheese are optional. You can omit them or replace them with up to 1/2 cup (125 ml) of other chopped vegetables and cheese.
 Cook the egg whites in your microwave at 100% power, setting the time for 1 minute and 15 seconds. Cook an additional 15 seconds if the egg whites still appear runny.If you want to cook an egg white patty, microwave the egg whites for the full amount of time and do not stir or otherwise agitate them.
If you want to cook scrambled egg whites, microwave them for 1 minute, stir well, and continue cooking them for an additional 15 to 30 seconds after that.
 Remove the egg whites from the microwave and enjoy them while they're still hot.


To serve an egg white patty, flip the egg whites out of the bowl in a single piece. Transfer it to your serving plate or place it over a slice of toast, a toasted bagel, or an English muffin.
You can serve scrambled egg whites straight from the cooking dish or transfer them to a separate serving plate.

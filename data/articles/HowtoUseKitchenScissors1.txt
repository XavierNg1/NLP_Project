 When choosing scissors, bear in mind the following requirements:


Look for thick, sturdy blades.
Feel the weight––prefer those that feel heavy and solid.
Serrated edges and finger grips can be a useful feature.
Check that they're washable in the dishwasher for best hygiene.
Go for quality––just as with good kitchen knives, you'll want these to last you for years to come.;

 Put two teaspoons of olive oil in a medium sized frying pan. Place the pan on the stove burner. Turn on the burner to medium-high heat.
 Add the onions to the hot oil in the frying pan. Fry the onions over medium-high heat until they are soft and begin to brown. This should take about 2-3 minutes., Once the onions are soft and have begun to brown, add the rest of the veggies. Place the bell pepper, Portobello mushrooms, oregano, and black pepper in the frying pan with the onions. Cook until soft. This will take about 7 minutes., After you have cooked the onions, mushrooms, bell pepper and spices together for about 7 minutes, you will need to reduce the heat. Turn the burner down to low heat., Use your hands to take a pinch of the tablespoon of flour. Lightly sprinkle the vegetables with flour. Repeat until you have sprinkled the entire tablespoon of flour over the vegetables. Stir to coat the vegetables., Once you have coated the vegetables with flour, add the broth and soy sauce to the skillet. Stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer and then remove from heat immediately. This should take 2-3 minutes or less., After removing the frying pan from the stove, top the vegetable mixture with the cheese slices. Lay the slices of cheese directly on top of the vegetables and let stand until melted. This should take about 1-2 minutes., Once the cheese is melted, you can serve the vegetables on toasted whole wheat buns. Use a spatula to scoop the mixture from the bottom of the pan, taking caution not to disrupt the cheese. Serve with a side of grilled vegetables or a salad for a well-rounded meal.

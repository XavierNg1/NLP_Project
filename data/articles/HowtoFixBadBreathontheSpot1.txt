 Some people who suffer from halitosis or are self-conscious of their breath will carry around a toothbrush with them. Bring a small tube of toothpaste. If you don’t have toothpaste, know that brushing with tap water can help reduce the smell of microbes that collect when you eat meals. Small, portable toothbrushes can be purchased at any grocery store or pharmacy cheaply.You can also try keeping a pack of mini, disposable toothbrushes with you. This way they won't get dirty and be sanitary each time you use one.;
, In addition to a toothbrush or in place of it, you can easily escape to the bathroom and floss your teeth. Many types of floss have a minty aftertaste that’ll help freshen your breath.


Dentists recommend that you floss after every meal to insure that food particles don't get lodged in between your teeth. If this seems like too much work, floss at least once a day — preferably before bedtime — to combat foul breath.Flossing after meals is one of the best ways to combat halitosis (bad breath).
Consider carrying floss or flossing tools, such as dental floss toothpicks, to floss easily on the go.
 Listerine comes in travel-sized bottles that can easily be carried in back pockets or pocket books. Gargle for 20 seconds and spit.

These are designed to combat bad breath quickly, but can be quite strong.

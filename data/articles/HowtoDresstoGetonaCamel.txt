 The average pack camel can carry about 400 pounds over 25 miles (181 kg over 40 km) in a day.So it won't be bothered about how many clothes you've got on. You, on the other hand, might be, so don't overdo it, especially when it's hot.;
, Walking, hiking or climbing clothes are a good choice, as clambering up on a camel and staying on it requires flexibility. Choose baggy clothing as this helps with flexibility. The basic rule is: if you can sit in the clothing on the ground, you can sit in it on a camel.


Prefer long pants, slacks or jeans. Camels have fleas, they can spit, and camel hair can be scratchy against a bare leg. By covering up, you will also protect your legs from the sunshine and the potential for getting saddle sores, caused by friction., Layering will let you remove layers if you get too hot, and put them back on if you're feeling chilled.
 You're up higher, so you will get some wind reaction. Roll it up and place it in a pocket, or tie it around your waist.
 Keep the sun off your face as you amble along on your camel. A hat with a tie-on is the best choice.


Consider wearing a Legionnaire's style sun hat, with the long piece covering your neck as well.
, Bare feet are not recommended around an animal as large as a camel. It could step on your feet and cause a lot of harm. In addition, avoid wearing any shoes that are not strapped or tied on. Camels can jolt, and you don't want shoe loss holding back your enjoyment.


Wear hiking or walking shoes, covered sandals, sneakers, etc.
 While a saddle might protect you from some odor transfer, expect some grime to mark your clothing, as is normal for any outdoor activity.

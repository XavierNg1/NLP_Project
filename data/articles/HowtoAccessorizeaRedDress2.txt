 In essence, pink is a light red. Not every shade of pink will match with every shade of red, so you should carefully examine compare a pink accessory before wearing it with your red dress.


If you don't know where to start, try silver-pink jewelry or a silver-pink metallic shoe. These pieces are mostly silver but have a slight hint of pink.
 Carry a handbag with red, yellow, and blue running through it, and match it with blue shoes or simple yellow earrings. Keep your accessories small and low-key to achieve a funky style without looking too busy.


This works well for casual and party dresses, but may be too much for a formal or semi-formal occasion.
 This works especially well if the shade of red matches the shade of your dress. Wear a scarf with red and violet stripes, or a sash with an abstract print in red and orange.
 For a Memorial Day picnic or 4th of July barbecue, tie a navy blue belt around a red sundress. Match it with white sandals and white earrings or novelty flag earrings.
 A red sweater dress can matched with deep green pumps can create a fun, seasonal look for the holiday season, but may not work well otherwise since many automatically associate a red-and-green color scheme with Christmas.
 Deep shades add color without looking too flashy. Bright colors may compete with a bright red dress, resulting in a tacky look.
 Try a simple, chocolate brown pump matched with a solid brown belt. For jewelry, look for pendants and earrings that contain brown gemstones like tiger's eye, amber, jasper, or topaz. The gemstones can be large, but only opt for one or two statement pieces.

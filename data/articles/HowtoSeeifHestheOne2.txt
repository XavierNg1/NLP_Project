 It's nice if he says "I love you too" after you say it but it's important that you aren't the only person saying the initial I love you. He needs to say it sometimes too. This shows that he thinks about how much he cares about you and that he's not just following the standard script that he feels is expected.


Don't get too worried if he doesn't, though. Some guys are very shy about sharing their feelings. Ask him why he never says it first and tell him that you like to hear it. This might make him more comfortable saying it to you.
 Someone who wants to enjoy your body before your heart is willing clearly doesn’t have your needs in mind. (And if he can’t see past his own desires when it comes to sex, he certainly won’t be able to when it comes to committing or starting a family.)

, If he frequently tells you what to do, tries to run your life, or manipulates your emotions to get what he wants, watch out! This guy is insecure and feels that he has the upper hand in your relationship. "The one" will be secure with you and let you be who you are.
 If he refuses to include you in his social plans and avoids telling you what he and the guys did last night, he obviously isn’t willing to include you in his life and might even be up to something shady.
 If the two of you aren’t in the stages of a relationship where you openly discuss future possibilities, pay attention to whether or not he drops any hints. Even something small, like wondering what the two of you will do for an event that’s at least a month or two away, is a good sign.


If he proposes to you too soon (e.g., before 1 year), take some time to analyze why he is rushing. If you are inclined to say yes, suggest a long engagement to be sure.
If he absolutely won't discuss a future together – even after a significant amount of time (say a year) – he is probably not considering one.

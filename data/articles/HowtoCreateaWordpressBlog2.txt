 You can create a WordPress blog in two different ways. If you have a hosting service, you can install WordPress through your webhost and have complete control over your blog. If you’d rather not deal with hosting and configuring the blog, you can have WordPress host it for you.


If you have your own host, you can install the WordPress software for free.
If you want to run ads on your blog, you will need to host it yourself. This is also true if you want to install custom themes or manually adjust the blog’s code.
 A webhost is your website’s server, and contains all of the data for your website. Several of the most popular webhosting services provide WordPress preinstalled, or allow easy installation. These include, but are not limited to:


HostGator
DreamHost
Go Daddy

, Most webhosts provide customers with a control panel (cPanel) that allows you to control the operation of your website.
 Most webhosts will have Wordpress already loaded and ready to install. Simply scroll down on your cPanel and look for the WordPress installation link. This is usually located in the Scripts category.You will be asked to create an admin username and password for your blog.
 If your webhost does not provide WordPress preinstalled, you will need to upload it to your webserver. To do this, download the script from the WordPress.org website.


Connect to your webhost via FTP. Upload the WordPress files to the root of your domain. If you want WordPress to exist in a subdomain on your site, create the folder for the subdomain and place the WordPress files in that folder.
Open the webpage where you uploaded the WordPress files to. You will see an option to run the installation script. Click the link and WordPress will install itself.
 Once the script has been installed, your WordPress blog is ready to use. Open the blog in your web browser, and log in with your administrator information. This will take you to your Dashboard, where you will be able to control all of the aspects of your blog.
 Click the New button at the top of the page to open the post creation window. Here you can create your first post, introducing yourself and your blog.


Add a title that stands out and makes the reader want to read your whole post.

 Ask them about LGBT+ topics, consume LGBT+ media, or wear rainbow colors, and notice how your parents react. Do they seem supportive or neutral? If so, this is a good sign.


If your parents are strongly anti-LGBT, and you are still financially dependent upon them, do not come out to them. Only revisit this decision once you are completely on your own. Do not risk your physical safety or finances (e.g. college fund). They are not entitled to private information about you.
 You'll want a relaxed time of day, when no one is rushing or particularly stressed. Look for a quiet time such as when doing chores together, driving in a long car ride, or cleaning up after supper.


If you tend to stammer a bit when you are nervous, practise repeating what you are going to say, slowly and carefully.
 Do this politely. If they are doing something else, it might be best to wait a bit longer to make sure they hear you. Once they are listening to you, start off with something like: "Hey Mum and Dad? I've got something important to tell you." This will get their attention. Then you can follow with something like: "I've decided, after doing some thinking, I'm coming out." Make sure to quickly follow by telling them you're asexual. You don't want to send them the wrong message.


Remember, you don't have to say exactly this, you can say something completely different if you like. This is just a guide to help you work out what to say.
 Maybe your parents will be shocked upon hearing this, or maybe they will take it in their stride; it all depends on who they are and how they comprehend asexuality. Just remember to give them space to think things over if they need it.


Some might be proud of you for coming out.
Others might have suspected for a while, or consider it not to be a big deal.
Some may not understand asexuality, and think that it is a medical condition or a problem. They may blame themselves. You can assure them that nothing is wrong and you're happy the way you are.

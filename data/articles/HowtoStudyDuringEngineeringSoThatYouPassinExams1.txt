 If you are planning to take 12 course credits, make sure they aren’t all engineering courses. Give your brain a break from math by adding a humanities course to the mix. Your advisor can help you to balance your schedule between engineering and non-engineering courses. , Most professors expect that for every engineering course credit you take, you will spend 2-4 hours studying. So, if you have two engineering courses in a standard semester, that’s six credits. That means you will need to spend an average of 18 hours studying outside of class per week. Make sure you have the time before you commit to the courses!

, Find out up front what the expectations will be. Make a note of important items, such as:


The policy on tardiness and absences. If a professor will fail you after three tardies or unexcused absences, you’ll want to pay close attention to be present and on time.
Assignment due dates. Is there homework due weekly? Daily? Make sure you understand how the coursework is structured.
Tests and test dates. If you aren’t a good test-taker, and the course grade is solely based on three test scores, this might not be the right class for you.
 This will eliminate the urge to fall asleep or get distracted. You will also be able to see and hear better, and it'll be easier to ask questions. Your professors will also be more motivated to see you succeed if you appear to be making an effort.
 You can usually find these at the top of your syllabus. Don’t be afraid to connect with your professors and ask them questions! They want to help you learn. And sometimes they can give you extra clues on what to expect to see on the test.

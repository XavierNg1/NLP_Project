 When your customer transfers the money in your favour, he/she will give you a transfer code. Use this transfer code to withdraw the money by filling out a form at a Western Union money transfer center in your town or city. You'll need:


The exact name of the person who has transferred the money.
Name of the city and country.
Reason for payment (in some places, business transactions are not allowed by this mode).
The transfer code (make sure there are no mistakes).

 Look for spicy, sweet and harvest-oriented scents like cinnamon, pumpkin spice and apple. Light a candle to spread the scent throughout a room, and the natural light of the flame can help add to the coziness of your home.


Avoid lighting too many candles at once so that the scent doesn’t become too overpowering.
Always blow out candles before leaving the room in which they are located.
 To make a simmer pot, fill a medium sized pot with water and turn the stove on high. After bringing the water to a boil, let it simmer and add in the cinnamon sticks. Add in orange rinds, apple peels, vanilla, anise or nutmeg as well. Keep the water simmering for hours.You may need to add extra water every 30 minutes or so. Keep an eye on the water level.
Use a crockpot to simmer the water all day long without much hassle.
These simmer pots are primarily for scent and shouldn’t be consumed.
 Add kindling and a couple of logs near the back of your fireplace and use a large lighter to get it started. Use a fire poker to keep the flame going evenly. Cover it with a metal grate.Make sure you clean your fireplace before each season.
Be sure to crack a window or door so your home doesn’t get too smoky.
Never leave a fire unattended.

 If you are going by a project basis, you will need to be able to say "That is beyond the scope of the project," so that you are not offering services for free if a client changes their mind. If a client wants to change the scope, build in a renegotiation process so that you aren't doing work you are not working on something for free.
 It is better to break into your consulting field by taking this 1-time hit in payment, than to set low rates. Your client will appreciate the discount, but understand when they are billed in full next time.
 You want to be able to bill at the higher rate, but if you feel that you want the client to be extra-pleased with your work, you have the freedom to bill for fewer hours than you worked. It is not a good idea to do this very often, but it is better than setting a low figure at the start.
 You want the client to see the value in employing you on larger projects, so raise your rates for small projects, and then offer to discount them if you take a larger role.
 If you are brand new, you can start high and send out proposals until you find a "sweet spot" where your services are billed at the right level. You may find that this level is higher than you expected.

 You can grip the steel bar in one of four ways: double overhand, double underhand, palms down, and reverse. Each method has its own individual techniques.

In the double overhand grip, you hold the bar close to your body, preferably just under the chin, with your hands gripping the steel from above. This method transfers the greatest force from your arm muscles into the bend and is the best grip to use on thicker bars.






In the double underhand grip, you also hold the bar close to your body, although at about the center of the breastbone. You will bend the bar upward, using your pinkies as fulcrums, and your driving muscle strength comes from your triceps and upper back.






In the palms down grip, you grip the bar with your hands the same as in the double overhand grip, but you hold the bar away from your body, either at arm's length or with your arms bent. Because you're holding the bar further from your body, your thumbs serve as fulcrums more when bending the steel than in the double overhand grip, requiring stronger thumb muscles.






In the reverse grip, you also hold the bar away from your body, but perpendicular to your chest instead of parallel to it as in the palms down grip. The hand further from your body grips the bar in an overhand grip, while the closer hand grips the bar underhanded. The further hand provides more of the bending force, while the thumb and forefinger of the near hand serve as a fulcrum.

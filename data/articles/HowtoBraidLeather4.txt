 This can be achieved in multiple ways, some more fancy than others.


As outlined in the 4-strand braiding method, you could tie the opposite ends of the braid to key-chain rings and connect the rings afterwards to form a bracelet. While this method is easiest, it may not look the most appealing.
Alternately, you could take the trick braided leather and puncture a small hole in the intact, 3/4 inch ends. Run a regular strand of leather through each hole and tie the ends off into knots. Adjust the size of the regular leather strand to better fit your wrist.To make a high quality, professional looking bracelet, hold the ends of your braid together so that they line up (this won't be necessary for the trick braid). Take a pinch crimp — which can be purchased at most jewelry shops — and place your braided ends inside of it. Use a pair of pliers to squeeze the pinch crimp shut over the ends. Now you're bracelet has metal ends like store-bought jewelry!, Though your necklace will differ mostly from your bracelet length-wise, you can add other accessories to customize it.


Find some beads with holes that run through them. You could run the braid through a single, tubular bead so that it sits in the middle, almost like a pendant.Or, you could fill the entire bottom portion of the braid with various colored beads so that only half of the braid is showing.
Instead of beads, put a locket on your braid. Place your picture inside and give it to a special someone as a token of your friendship. Or, you could find letter pendants and use them to spell your name across the bottom of the braid. The possibilities are virtually endless!

, Once you become an expert at braiding normal-sized strands, challenge yourself by braiding even smaller ones.


Use the hair braiding method to weave black and brown strands together. Make a standard length braid and then cut it to ring-size once you're done. Fit the ends with pinch crimps and wear the ring on your finger with pride.

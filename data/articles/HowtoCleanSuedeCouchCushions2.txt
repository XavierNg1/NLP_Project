 For suede couches that can’t handle any type of liquid, clean them with your vacuum. It’s best to use your vacuum's upholstery attachment – the brush attached to it will help you work up the nap and get more dirt and debris out of the suede., Beginning at one edge of the cushion, run the vacuum slowly down the cushion, moving against the grain. Overlap your vacuuming paths to ensure you get all of the debris and dirt possible off of your cushions., If your suede cushions are not removable, use your vacuum’s crevice attachment to clean in between the cushions. A lot of dirt and debris can fall into these cracks, so it’s important to clean them.

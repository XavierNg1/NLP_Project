 It may be tempting to buy your dog a Santa hat and a fur-trimmed Christmas sweater or a handmade ceramic food dish and holly-trimmed dog-biscuit jar, but these gifts are geared towards people’s pleasure, not pet’s. If you want your pooch to be merry, get them a gift that they’ll actually enjoy, like a treat or toy.Be sure to get toys and treats that appropriate to your dog’s size. For instance, if you have a Saint Bernard, you should go for durable toys that are designed for large breeds.
Pick toys that align with dog’s favorite activities. If they love to chew, get them a chew toy. If they love to play fetch, get them a glow-in-the-dark ball or a new frisbee.;
, If you’re going to get your dog a present, it may as well be something that they need or will put to regular use. Pet stores will be filled with seasonal gifts, but the wisest use of your money is to put it towards something they can use repeatedly, all year round.For example, if you notice that your dog’s plastic water dish is getting grungy, try giving them a stainless steel, non-slip bowl. If your puppy has outgrown their old bed, get them a new cozy sleeping pad.
 While pet companies roll out many a red and green treat over the holiday season, these Christmas-colored products are to attract you, the buyer, not your dog. Your dog does not care what color a treat comes in, so you might as well stick to ones that do not contain potentially harmful synthetic dyes, like Red 40.In fact, dogs can only see a limited amount of the color spectrum, which does not in fact include red or green.

 Use a plastic cutting surface to avoid contaminating a wooden cutting board.
 Brush the grill with cooking oil, and preheat it to a medium high temperature. Allow the grill to get thoroughly heated.


Take care not to let the grill get too hot, or you'll end up with charred steak that's raw on the inside.
 Cook it for for approximately 4 minutes on the first side. Use tongs to flip them over after the first side has grill marks and has formed a brown crust. Grill the other side for an additional 4 minutes.

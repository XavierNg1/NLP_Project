 Three suitable essential oils for this purpose are: Cinnamon essential oil, peppermint essential oil and cayenne pepper essential oil.As with any use of essential oil direct on skin, always to a skin patch test first and be aware of the contraindications associated with that oil; ask the herbal specialist at the store you purchase the oils from for advice.


Cinnamon oil stimulates increased blood flow in the lip capillaries.
Peppermint oil also stimulates the blood flow and plumps out the lips. It has a refreshing and cooling flavor.
Cayenne pepper oil stimulates the blood flow but must be used with great caution as anything more than minute amounts can burn your lips.
 After selecting the oil, it is applied as follows:


For cinnamon and peppermint oils, add one to two drops to your regular lip balm, lip gloss or Vaseline. Add the drop to the amount of balm, gloss or Vaseline being added, not the whole container.
For cayenne pepper oil, add one drop to your usual lip balm or to Vaseline. Do not use too much.
Add the enhanced balm, gloss or Vaseline to your lips as usual.
 This will wear off, then your lips will look plumper and rosier.

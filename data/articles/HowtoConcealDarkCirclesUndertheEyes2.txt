 Red lipstick helps to neutralize the darkness under your eyes. Use an eye shadow brush to cover the entire dark area with the lipstick. The lipstick you choose will depend on your skin tone.If you are fair skinned, use a lipstick with red with pink undertones.
If you have medium skin, use a red with purplish undertones.
If you have dark skin, use a red with orange undertones.
You may have to use more concealer if you use this technique.
 Cover the lipstick with the concealer of your choice. Start with a thin layer and blend the color until you can no longer see any of the red. You can use a brush or a makeup sponge to blend. Again, do not rub the concealer in. This may work better for people with darker skin tones.
 Once you have applied and blended your concealer, set with a translucent powder. You can then finish the rest of your makeup routine. If you notice a pink-ish or orange like color under your eyes now, simply apply another thin layer of concealer until the orange or pink is no longer visible.


Remember a polished look will distract from your dark circles.

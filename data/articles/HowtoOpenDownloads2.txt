 OS X includes a Downloads folder that acts as the default download location for most programs for every user. There are a couple of ways you may be able to find your Downloads folder:


Click your Downloads folder in your Dock.
Click the Go menu and select Downloads

Open a Finder window. Press ⌥ Opt+⌘ Cmd+L to open the Downloads folder.
 Downloaded files have a tendency to get spread out across your computer over time, especially if you use a lot of different programs to download. Some other popular places for your downloads to appear include your Desktop or in your Documents folder.


If you have a secondary drive that acts as a file storage, check to see if you've created a download folder on it as well.
 If you know the name of the file you downloaded, you can search for it to quickly open it. Open a Finder window and press ⌘ Cmd+F to open the search bar. Start typing in the name of the file and select it from the search results.
 You shouldn't have much difficulty opening most files that you download online, but you may run across a few file types that can give you problems. See the guides below for details on opening these troublesome files.


Playing MKV video files
Burning ISO image files
Extracting RAR files
Using BIN files

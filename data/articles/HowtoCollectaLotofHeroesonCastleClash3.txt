 Tap the present icon that has the number 2 on it. Claim your 5 gems, then go to the other tab to claim your rewards. Usually you will get packs, books, or slimes, but sometimes, you do get hero cards, which you can open up into heroes.


You will get at least 2 legendary heroes each month for free. At one point in the calendar, you will get another Druid, which is a legendary hero. Each month, you will always get a Druid. Consider saving them up since they can be helpful in many ways.
In the last day of the calendar, you will get a legendary hero card. Open it and you will get a random legendary hero.
 There are also elite and ordinary hero cards, as well as sacrifice cards, which are cards that give slimes in hero form. Sell any heroes you don't want if you'd like.

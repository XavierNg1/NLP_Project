 You could need a new battery. Disable the alarm by removing the alarm fuse, and then bring the car to the shop. They can check your battery and move on from there if the problem is the alarm system.
 Lock your car electronically using the remote, if you have one. Push down the locking pin on the door manually if the remote does not engage the lock or if you don't have a remote. Use your remote key or click the "lock" button on the driver's side door to engage the lock. If this does not work:


Disconnect the negative battery terminal.
Turn the key to on position.
Reattach the negative battery terminal.
Turn the key to off position.
Start the car., Your alarm sensors are poorly calibrated. You'll need to adjust them so that they do not continue to cause problems whenever a dog brushes up against the car. To do so, refer to your owner's manual under the heading "Alarm System." Most cars can be re-calibrated to be less sensitive without going into the shop. There are two types of alarm sensor controls:



DIP Switches: These are a series of toggles that control how much electricity runs through the sensors. Turning a few off will make your alarm system less touchy. These are built into the main control unit of the alarm system.

Rheostat: Using a small screwdriver, you can loosen up a bolt that adjusts the resistance in the sensor, making it more or less sensitive. These sensors are mounted externally., When a car refuses to start, most people go through a series of checks to find the issue. After all the checks lead to no solution, consider checking the car alarm. Some alarms are wired with the ignition as an anti-theft measure. Attempt to disable or reset the alarm, and then try starting your car.

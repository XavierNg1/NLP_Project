 To use this method, you should see at least one binomial in your expression. It can be in the numerator, denominator, or both. A binomial is a polynomial with two terms.For example, the expression 4x16x2−2x{\displaystyle {\frac {4x}{16x^{2}-2x}}} has two terms in the denominator. Thus, the denominator contains a binomial.
 The factor must be common to all terms in the expression. Factor out this term and rewrite the expression.For example, the monomial 2x{\displaystyle 2x} is common to each term in the expression 4x16x2−2x{\displaystyle {\frac {4x}{16x^{2}-2x}}}. So after factoring this term out of the numerator and denominator, your expression will look like this: 2x(2)2x(8x−1){\displaystyle {\frac {2x(2)}{2x(8x-1)}}}.
 The monomial term factored out of the numerator and denominator cancels to 1, since you are dividing that term by itself.For example:2x(2)2x(8x−1){\displaystyle {\frac {2x(2)}{2x(8x-1)}}}2x(2)2x(8x−1){\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {2x}}(2)}{{\cancel {2x}}(8x-1)}}}


, This will leave you with your simplified rational expression. If you factored correctly, there will be no more factors that are common to each term in the numerator and denominator.

For example:2x(2)2x(8x−1){\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {2x}}(2)}{{\cancel {2x}}(8x-1)}}}28x−1{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{8x-1}}}

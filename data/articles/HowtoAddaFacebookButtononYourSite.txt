 This is where you will get your Facebook badge.;
, There are four types of badges to choose from:


Profile Badge—This badge, when opened, leads directly to your Facebook Timeline/Profile.
Photo Badge—The Photo Badge contains link to photos uploaded and shared on your Facebook Timeline.
Like Badge—A Like Badge opens up directly to a public page that you’ve liked on Facebook.
Page Badge—Instead of your Timeline, a Page Badge opens up your public Facebook page.
 These include photos, liked pages, or one of your public Facebook pages.
 You can share it directly on your Blogger or TypePad site, so when visitors browse your site, a "Badge" button will appear on the page.


If you want to share it to other sites aside from Blogger and TypePad, click on "Other." Copy the HTML code inside the text field and paste it in the codes sections of your website.

 You are being treated with respect by the man who is asking you out, as he values you enough to want to form a more intimate relationship with him. So, be sure to return that respect. Listen carefully and look attentive as he explains his wishes.;
, Smile and nod if it's appropriate to do so, but wait him out. When he finishes and makes it clear that he is waiting for a reply, offer your reasons for turning him down.

 The game is played with 2 players. There are 2 pockets on opposing sides of the bumper pool table. Each player shoots at the pocket opposite his staring position on the table.;
, Each player gets 5 balls. One set of balls is white and the other set of balls is red. There are rows of 5 starting spots on the table. Each player places her balls on the spots on her own side of the table.


Note that 1 red ball has a white dot on it and 1 white ball has a red dot on it. These spotted balls are to be placed on the middle starting spot of each player's respective starting rows.
 At an agreed upon count, the players simultaneously strike their spotted balls and attempt to get them into the object pocket on the other side of the table. The presence of bumpers in a cluster in the middle of the table makes a straight shot impossible, so the players must bank their balls off of the side rails of the table. To avoid having the first shots interfere with each other, both players must make their opening shots towards the table rail to the players' right.
 The player that placed his ball closer to the object pocket will shoot first. If both players pocketed the opening shot, they must perform another opening shot using the leftmost ball in the starting line up of balls.
 Each player continues to shoot for as long as he can continue to pocket balls. Failure to pocket a ball on a shot passes play over to the other player.


Pocket balls in the proper order. The spotted ball must be pocketed first. After pocketing the spotted ball, the other 4 balls may be pocketed in any order.






Determine a winner. When a player has pocketed her last ball, that player wins the game.

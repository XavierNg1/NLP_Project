 To take a screen capture of whatever is currently displayed on your iDevice, press and hold the Power and Home buttons for one second. You should hear a shutter sound, and the screenshot will be placed on your Camera Roll.
 The procedure varies from device to device, and not all Android devices support screenshots. Almost any device running Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0) or later supports screenshots. Screenshots can be viewed in your Gallery in the Screenshots folder.


For Samsung Galaxy devices, press and hold the Power and Home buttons for one second. You will hear a shutter sound.
The HTC One uses the Power and Home or Power and Volume Down buttons. Press and hold for one second.
The Nexus 4 and Kindle Fire use the Power and Volume Down buttons. Press and hold for one second.

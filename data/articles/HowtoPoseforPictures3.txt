 Because you are posing alone, you donâ€™t have to worry about the way anyone else looks in your photo. Pose in such a way as to accentuate the best that you have to offer.
 Instead of a standard portrait, take photos that are idiosyncratic. There is no need for you to take a photo that looks just like the ones all your friends take. Instead, find a pose, background, lighting, or outfit that helps you to stand out as an individual.


Take a self portrait while doing something you love. Whether that be playing a sport, reading a book, or walking through nature, find something that people can identify as being something you enjoy.
Dress for your photos so that you can show off your unique style.
Feel free to use props to make your photo unique, but be careful of looking like you are acting with them., Candid photos catch you while you are doing something naturally, rather than being entirely posed. Although the best candids are taken while you are unaware of the photographer, good candids can be recreated through posing.

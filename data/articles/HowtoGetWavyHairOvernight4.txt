 Make sure that your hair is not soaking wet, however, or it may not dry all the way by the next morning. If you have very straight hair, or hair that does not hold curls or waves very well, you might want to add some hairspray or styling cream. This will help the waves last longer.
 Start by pulling your hair into a half-up half-down ponytail. Wrap a hair tie around the ponytail. Next, separate the bottom part of your hair into two pigtails. Secure each one with a hair tie. You will be removing the hair ties later; they are in there to keep your hair out of the way.









You can divide your hair up into more sections. For example, you can have two sections at the top, and two at the bottom. The more sections you have, the wavier and curlier your hair will be., Keep twisting tightly until you get to the end of your hair.
 Continue gently twisting the section of hair until you feel it begin to roll into a bun. Wind the hair around itself naturally until a small bun form. Secure it in place with bobby pins. You may also need to wrap a hair tie around it to keep it in place.
 Do each section one at a time. Take the hair tie off of the left section, twirl the hair into a rope, and roll it into a bun. Secure it with bobby pins before moving onto the right section.
 Sleep on your hair and remove the pins and hair ties in the morning. Gradually unwind and untwist your hair, brushing your fingers through the waves to create a more natural look.









You can also use a little gel, mousse, or hairspray to give your waves extra hold, if needed.

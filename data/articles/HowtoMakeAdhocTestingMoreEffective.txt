 Read a lot about defects from other projects. This will prepare the testers to detect bugs that would have gone unnoticed.;
, Create a rough draft and NOT a detailed plan containing details like what to test, how to test and what problems to look for.
 Test the application or software part by part i.e., one functionality at a time. This provides better focus and understanding of the problems, if any.
 Target those areas that have not been covered, in detail, in the test designs or user documentation.
 At times certain defects may be brought to light by debuggers, profilers, and task monitors. So a thorough knowledge about these tools can make matters easy for the testers.
 Make a record of what bugs you found, where in the application the bugs appeared, and the function. These records helps the developer and also testers of future applications. Also record what bugs you didn't find. That may seem odd, but there needs to be a record of what worked.

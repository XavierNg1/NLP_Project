 Rub at the stain to remove as much of the glue as possible just by rubbing.








Naturally, use your common sense with respect to very delicate fabrics––rubbing or scrubbing may damage the fibers.
Add some heavy-duty liquid detergent to the water to make this solution more effective. About 2 Tbsp (30 ml) should work.
 Scrape the glue off with a blunt knife or spatula, then wash the clothing as usual. You can also pre-treat the stain if you'd normally do that before washing.









Do not use acetone on clothing that contains acetate or acetate variations––the clothing will melt.
Always trial a test spot before using on any clothing.
Note that acetone can dull the color behind the glue stain.
 If the clothing is expensive or you can't get the glue off yourself, take it to a professional. Better safe than sorry.

 Switch on the oven's broiler setting and allow it to preheat for roughly 5 minutes. (10 minutes for ovens with broilers in base)


Meanwhile, pull out a small baking sheet. If don't correctly, the bun should not stick to the baking sheet, so there's no need to cover the pan with foil or cooking spray.
Note that this method can be used to toast hamburger-style sandwich buns, sub-style sandwich buns, and hotdog buns.;
, Split open the bun and brush melted butter over the cut sides of both halves.


You only need to spread butter over the cut sides of the bun; leave the crust sides dry.
When spreading the butter, make sure that you coat the entire cut side, including the edges. The edges are especially prone to burning if left dry.
 Set the bun halves cut-side up onto the prepared baking sheet. Slide the baking sheet beneath your preheated broiler and keep it there until the bun halves turn golden brown.The bun halves will brown quickly, so you need to watch them closely to prevent them from burning.
Since the heating element of broiler lies at the top of the oven, the cut sides of the bun halves must face the top of the oven. You only need to toast the cut sides of the bun, so you do not need to turn the bun halves during the browning process.
 Enjoy the toasted bun while it's still hot and crispy.

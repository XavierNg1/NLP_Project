 Whatever you use, just be sure it's clean. Good choices include:

A lint-free cleaning cloth (as shown in the images for this article)



 


A makeup sponge (circular, rectangular, or triangular)






A cotton swab






A specialized iPod cleaning cloth (although you really don't need to go to this unnecessary expense)
A cloth to dry - a clean lint-free cloth.





;
, Use a towel (as shown here), a silicon or non-slip craft mat, to prevent slippage while cleaning.


Remove any attached peripherals, and remove it from any cover or case.






Pause or turn off the iPod.






For older generation iPods, slide the "Hold" button until the red color shows.
 Dip the cloth into water in a glass or similar clean container. Avoid soaking it in the water. Wring the cloth so that it's damp only, not dripping.


If you'd rather use an iPod cleaner, follow the instructions. It's likely that you'll be asked to spray the contents direct onto the cloth or sponge.
 Concentrate first on gently removing dirt and grime, then wipe carefully to restore the luster. While it's recommended to clean either by resting on a slip-free towel or other surface, if it's easier, clean by holding the iPod face up in your palm; just take care not to leave fingerprints on it as you clean.
, Use a clean, dry lint-free cloth to dry the iPod and polish it. Cleaned in this way regularly, your iPod should remain in top condition.
 Also, try to keep your iPod out of dirty places.

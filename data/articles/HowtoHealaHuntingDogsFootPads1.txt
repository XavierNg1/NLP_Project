 You can help your dog heal more quickly from any kind of foot wound by limiting its activity for at least five to seven days after its injury. Get a splint for your dog’s foot to keep the pad from touching the ground and to keep weight off the pad. This can help abrasions and bruises heal more quickly., Until the foot has fully recovered, you should only take your dog on leash walks. Doing so will allow you to control what your dog is walking on, how long it is walking, and the pace at which it is walking. Limiting these things can help cut down on the likelihood that your dog will reinjure its foot before it is completely healed., It may also be necessary to keep your dog in its crate for the majority of the day while it is healing. Doing so will restrict its movement and keep it off its feet more than if it is allowed to go anywhere in the house. Again, do this for about five to seven days after the injury.


Make sure your dog has plenty of toys to play with in its crate, as well as access to fresh water at all times.
If your dog loves attention, place its crate in a high traffic area of the house. If your dog is shy or nervous, however, placing its crate in a quiet room might be better.
If you are crating your dog during the day when no one is home, you can make your dog feel more comfortable by leaving a radio playing softly or leaving the TV on while you are away.Don’t leave your dog in its crate for too long at one time. If possible, allow your dog to leave the crate every few hours. When it’s not in its crate, you can keep your dog from walking too much by using baby gates or closing doors to limit its access to just one or two rooms., Many paw pad injuries will heal significantly with rest. However, if your dog’s injury doesn’t seem to be getting better with rest and you’re not comfortable trying to treat the dog’s injuries yourself, take your dog to the vet. The vet can diagnose your dog’s injury and take care of the initial treatment.

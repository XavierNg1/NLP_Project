 To say “beautiful girl,” you would say "niña hermosa."


The phrase is pronounced “ehr-moh-sah moo-hehr.” In Spanish, the “h” is not pronounced like an English hard “h.” The ending “hehr” does not have a hard “r” sound like it would in English. Niña is pronounced "nee-nyah."Another way to say this phrase, especially in Spain, is “eres hermosa,” which means “you’re very beautiful." You can also say “eres preciosa” for "you’re beautiful" or "eres atractiva," for "you’re good looking." Eres is pronounced "eh-rehs" with a long "a" sound.;
, Another way to say this is “estás hermosa.” If you want to really emphasize it, say “you are so beautiful” by saying “eres muy hermosa.”It’s pronounced “es-tas bay-ah.” The “ll” in Spanish does not have a hard “L” sound like it would in English. That’s the key to not mispronouncing the word “bella,” which, literally, means “beautiful.”To say “hello beautiful lady,” you would say, “hola señora Hermosa.” This phrase is pronounced “oh-lah seh-neeoh-rah er-moh-sa” and would be used toward an older woman., They can be very different from English.

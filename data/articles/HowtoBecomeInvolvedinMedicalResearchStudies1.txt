, Visit the websites of any nearby medical research departments or facilities attached to local hospitals. You can also call these places or visit them in person. If there is a specific study you are interested in joining, contact the principal investigator. Otherwise, look for a research coordinator at the facility to volunteer yourself as a general participant.
 If you live near a major research center, university, or hospital, you may be able to find medical advertisements put up locally. Keep an eye on the posters found on buses, subways, and taxis. Read the bulletin boards at your local coffee shop. By being constantly on the lookout, you may find a trial that works for you. They may even be advertised on TV.
 Some trials offer monetary compensation, and most will provide some level of free health care. That said, there may be many hidden costs in the trial.



Cost of transportation: Some trials may be able to cover your transportation costs while others will expect you to pay for it. If the trial is close by or does not require travel, this will not matter. That said, if the trial is far away, you may have to pay substantially for treatment.

Cost of health care: While the researchers will most likely cover any tests or medications that are directly required for the study, you may need additional care that is not compensated.

 The cloudy, brown film you see in some bottles of apple cider vinegar is called “the mother”, and it’s a good thing. It means the vinegar is of high quality, and contains extra healing nutrients that will make it even more effective., You will want enough so that you can stick both your feet in. If more volume is needed, consider adding warm water, being sure to not dilute the vinegar beyond one part vinegar to one part water.If you do not have apple cider vinegar, you can also use white vinegar.
 Rinse your feet with soap and water. Once your feet are scrubbed clean, dry them off with a towel or let them air-dry. If you choose to use a towel, make sure to wash it immediately after you use it so that it can’t spread the fungus to other parts of your body., Place your foot in the large bowl of vinegar mix. The acid of the vinegar will kill the fungus, as well as soften and break down the calluses it causes. If you want, you can use a washcloth to gently scrub the infected spot while your foot soaks in the mixture.


5% vinegar should not be too harsh for your skin. However, if you feel burning or a rash occurs, stop soaking your foot and add water to dilute the mixture.
 You should do this two to three times a day for seven days. Once those seven days are up, continue to soak your foot for one to two times a day for three more days. After the 10 to 30 minutes have passed, take your foot out of the bowl and dry it.
 If your infected spot is very small, you can also dip a cotton ball or washcloth into the solution and rub the infected spot. Press the cloth on the fungus and hold it there for several minutes, then dip it back into the mixture and repeat. Do this twice a day for 10 to 30 minutes at a time.
 The acid in vinegar can be hard on your skin. To protect it, consider applying a thin layer of moisturizer after treating your feet.

 The map is located in the central navigation area of the Normandy.

Find the "Artemis Tau" cluster, then select the "Knossos" solar system.
Choose to land on the planet named "Therum."

, There are no alternative or optional areas that you can go to on this planet. About halfway through the mission, you will reach an area too narrow for the Mako. At this point, you must walk the rest of the way to the dig site. You will encounter Geth troops and larger tank-like units along the path., Upon entering the dig site, more Geth troops will assault you. Defeat them and head down the elevators to Liara. She is caught in a stasis field., Liara will mention that you can use a nearby laser to blast away some rocks blocking the path to the stasis field controls. Head down a nearby ramp to the laser, defeating the Geth troops that attack you.

The laser has a button sequence you must figure out and input to activate it.
 The terminal is located right next to Liara. Simply go up to it and use it., You will automatically head up an elevator that leads Liara and your squad to a group of Geth and a Krogan attempting to capture her. After defeating them, Liara comes aboard the Normandy and joins your squad.

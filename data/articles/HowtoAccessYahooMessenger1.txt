, Enter your Yahoo ID and password on the fields provided then click the “Sign In” button. You will be brought to your Inbox.
 On the left panel, there’s a tabbed header menu. Click the tab with the smiley icon. This will open a small window on your screen for Yahoo Messenger.
 You will see your status on the header of the Yahoo Messenger window. If you aren’t logged in yet, “Offline” will appear there. Click it to sign in then select among “Available,” “Busy,” and “Invisible” as your status upon logging in. You don’t need to enter your Yahoo ID and password anymore since you’re already logged into Yahoo.


If you want to log in and have your friends know you’re available to chat and talk, click on “Available.” Your friends will know your status by the green dot in front of your name.
If you want to log in, but do not necessarily want to be disturbed, click “Busy.” Your friends will see you online, but they will know you are busy by the red dot in front of your name.
If you want to log in, but would like to hide from your friends, click on “Invisible.” Your friends will not know you’re online. You can pick and choose which friends you want to talk to, without risking others knowing you’re online. Your name will appear as if you’re offline, with the gray dot in front of it.
 You can now start sending messages to your friends and chatting with them. Double-click on the name of your friend from your contact list on the left panel, and type in your message in the chat box that appears on the right panel.

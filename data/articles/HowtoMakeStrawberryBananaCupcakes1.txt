 Turn on the oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Place cupcake liners into two muffin tins so you'll have enough for 24 strawberry banana cupcakes.If you don't have liners, you could just spray the muffin tins with baking spray or you could grease and flour the tins.;
, Place 4 large eggs, 1/2 cup (125 g) of strawberry yogurt, and 1 cup (240 ml) of milk in a large mixing bowl. Beat the wet ingredients with an electric mixer until they're completely combined. Sift one box of dry strawberry cake mix and 4 tablespoons of dry instant strawberry pudding mix to the wet ingredients.For a stronger banana flavor, you could use dry instant banana pudding instead of strawberry.
 Stir the dry pudding and cake mix into the wet ingredients just until they're combined. Pour in 1/4 cup (56 g) of melted butter and stir the batter until the butter is incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and beat the batter for another 15 to 20 seconds on medium speed.Avoid over mixing the batter or it may make tough cupcakes.
 Scoop 3 tablespoons of cupcake batter into each prepared muffin liner. You should fill 2 muffin tins to make a total of 24 cupcakes. Bake the cupcakes in the preheated oven for 16 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Remove the cupcakes and let them cool completely before you frost them.Consider using a cookie or ice cream scoop to scoop the batter into the muffin tins.
 Scoop one 12-ounce (340 g) container of ready-to-spread whipped vanilla frosting into a mixing bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of banana extract and beat the frosting ingredients with an electric mixer until it's completely combined. Use an offset spatula to spread frosting over the cupcakes and top each one with a banana or strawberry slice.For a more professional look, you could fill a piping bag with the frosting. Pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes using your favorite piping tip.

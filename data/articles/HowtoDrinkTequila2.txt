 Oro, meaning "gold," tastes similar to blanco and costs about the same. Remember to choose 100% agave tequila. Mixtos may be cheap, but a nasty headache in the morning is expensive.
 You don't have to go through the salt-and-lime routine if you don't want to. (Most Mexicans don't drink tequila this way, anyway.) Take room-temperature tequila, pour it into a shot glass, toast, and pour it down your gullet.
 The salt-and-lime method of shooting tequila has been around for a while, though it's not clear that it's a popular way of shooting tequila in Mexico. One report suggests that the oldest known mention of the salt-and-lime technique, from 1924, reverses the order: First lime, then tequila, then salt.Either way, it's a popular way of shooting tequila, even if it's detested by snobs the world 'round. Here's how:


Lick the skin between your thumb and index finger. Shake a little bit of salt on your skin, which should stick to the moisture.
With a tequila shot and lime wedge in hand, lick the salt on your hand and shoot the tequila. Try to get the tequila down in one gulp if you can. You are shooting it, after all.
As a "chaser," suck on the lime wedge after shooting the tequila. The acidity of the lime won't taste as sharp after the alcohol.

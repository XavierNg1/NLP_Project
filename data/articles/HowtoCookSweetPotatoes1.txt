 Line a rimmed baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil.;
, Use a vegetable brush and running water to remove any dirt and grime off the skin of the sweet potatoes.
 Use the tines of a fork to make holes in the skin of each potato, piercing the potato three or four times. Place the pierced sweet potatoes on the prepared baking sheet.
 The sweet potatoes need to bake until they become tender, which will usually take between 45 - 60 minutes.
 Place each sweet potato inside a clean kitchen towel. Roll the potato on the counter, pressing on it gently. Doing so loosens the flesh inside.
 Use a knife to slit open each potato from one end to the other.
 Each sweet potato should be topped with about 1 tbsp. (15 ml) of butter. Add salt and pepper to taste.

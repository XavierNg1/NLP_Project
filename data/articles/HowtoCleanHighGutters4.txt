 Hold your gutter vacuum at roughly the base of the extension attachment. Switch on your vacuum. Pass the downward facing end of the hook slowly over the gutter to remove leaves, twigs, and other debris.If your gutters are especially clogged, you may need to empty your vacuum while cleaning. Overly full vacuums may have decreased suction and leave behind gutter buildup.
 Although most of the buildup will likely be gone after vacuuming, stubborn blockages may remain. Lean a suitable ladder against your home and climb it to visually inspect the gutters. Dismount the ladder, then target remaining clogs with your gutter vacuum.Some obstructions may still remain even after being targeted with your gutter vacuum. Use a tree trimmer, pole, or a sturdy stick to poke at and loosen these obstructions. Suck up loosened material with your vacuum., Tie a garden hose to a pole or long stick. Turn on the hose and lift it up to the gutter. Rinse the entire gutter with water to remove any small debris remaining. Poor waterflow at the downspout may indicate a blockage in the spout.Clogs can be removed from downspouts with a plumbing snake. Use the snake in the same fashion you would to remove a clogged drain.

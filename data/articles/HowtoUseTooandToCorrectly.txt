 "Too" is used less frequently than "to," so if you know what "too" means, then you can use it just for those specific meanings. You can feel confident that when "too" is not appropriate, "to" is the right choice.Try stressing (emphasizing) "too" when spoken, to help yourself assess whether it is the correct word. If the word is meant to be "to," it will sound odd if stressed. "Too" can be emphasized without sounding unusual.
 The first meaning is "also" or "besides"; the second meaning is "excessively" or "extra". In addition, some people use it to mean "very".Think of too as being relevant when there is an increase in something, such as temperature, difficulty, etc.; for example, "too hot", "too challenging", or "too soft". Choose the word "too" when it can be substituted for the word "also."

For example: "She felt awful too (also)" or "I can see you too (also)".


Use "too" to modify or emphasize a word.

For example: "The weather is too (excessively) hot", "I've eaten too (excessively) much", or "The package is too (excessively/extra) big".


"He wasn't too (very) interested in my book."

 A tie is the part of an outfit a man can have the most fun with, so experiment with different colors, patterns, or textures. The great thing about a cool tie is that it is playful yet still professional, and shows personality. By looking closely at the fabric of your suit, you’ll also notice that it’s made up of a few colors rather than just one. For example, a gray suit could actually have gray, brown and pink in the tread of the fabric. Identify those colors of your suit and showcase them in your tie selections.
, This is a little difficult since these shoes don’t come in many colors, but if you rotate between 3 or even 2 pairs (e.g., black, brown and camel), you’ll keep the outfit fresh. You can also have 2 or 3 pairs of the same color shoes (e.g., brown) but they come in different finishes (Patten leather, alligator and suede). The different finishes will all cater to a slightly different look that could further improve the versatility of your suit.
Women could consider rotating colors as well, but also rotating the style. Wear a flat one day, a heel the next, then switch on and off in that same pattern.



For men, cufflinks or watches are pretty standard ‘jewelry’ and can be switched fairly often. You don’t need to have a watch for every day of the week, but switching out the bands can be a nice way to change the look just a little. If you wear cufflinks, collect a few pairs you like, and keep them on rotation. You can also experiment with tie clips if you regularly wear ties with your suit.
For women, keep the jewelry classy and not too over the top, but still have fun, show personality, and rotate pieces to ensure a fresh look. If you wear a great bracelet one day, try a statement necklace the next day, and some nice earrings the day after that.

 Here's what you'll need to make baked sweet potato fries:


Two large sweet potatoes
1/3 cup olive oil
1 Tablespoon dried or fresh rosemary
pinch of salt
freshly ground pepper

, Rinse the sweet potatoes and peel them using a vegetable peeler. Discard the peels. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 Use a sharp knife to slice the sweet potatoes into flat, rectangular pieces the shape of fries. Make them as long or short as you want.


Thicker fries will be soft inside. Thinner fries will get crunchy.
 Add the sweet potatoes, olive oil, rosemary, salt, and several grinds of pepper to a medium bowl. Use a spoon or tongs to toss the potatoes, making sure all the pieces are coated with oil and spices. Turn the mixture onto a baking sheet and spread the pieces out in one even layer.
 Bake the sweet potato fries for 15 or 20 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and stir the fries, flipping them to the other side. Bake for 5 to ten more minutes, or until the fries are lightly browned and crispy around the edges.

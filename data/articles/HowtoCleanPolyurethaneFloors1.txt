 The first step in everyday cleaning is to remove debris from the floor. Vacuuming can do the trick, but a vacuum cleaner designed for cleaning the floor is best. If you don't have a vacuum cleaner like that, you can turn off the interior rotation brushes (if possible) to make the vacuum for your floor., Instead of vacuuming, you can simply sweep the floor. A broom with synthetic fiber tips (exploded tips) is often the best solution. You can also run a dust mop over the floor instead., If you spill something on polyurethane hardwood floors, use a damp cloth to clean it up as quickly as possible. If the spill has dried and isn't easily cleaned up, you can try a bit of glass cleaner to help clean it up., You can also mop the floors if they get particularly dirty. However, you want to stick to just a damp mop, not a sopping wet mop. Add a small cap- or spoonful of a mild cleaner, such as dishwashing soap or a wood floor cleaner, to clean water. Use one cap per bucket of water.Dip the mop in the solution. The mop should only be damp, so squeeze out as much water as you can. When you mop the floor, go in the direction of the grain.
Change out the water as needed.

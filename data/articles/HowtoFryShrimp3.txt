 Pour the oil into a deep fryer and heat until it reaches 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).


If you do not have a deep fryer, use a heavy saucepan or large skillet. Heat the oil over medium-high heat if using the stove.
Monitor the temperature of the oil using a candy thermometer. Reduce the heat if it rises too high or turn the heat up if it drops too low.
 Combine these liquid ingredients in a shallow baking dish or bowl, whisking until thoroughly blended.


Make sure that the dish or bowl you use has a wide mouth. A narrow mouth will make it difficult for you to dunk the shrimp later on.
If you have a low tolerance for hot, spicy foods, use less hot sauce or leave it out completely.
 In a separate shallow baking dish, combine these dry ingredients together until well mixed.


Make sure that the dish or bowl you use has a large opening.
If you are uncertain about how much salt and pepper to use, try using 3 tsp (15 mL) salt and 2 tsp (10 mL) ground black pepper.
 Use clean hands or tongs to dunk each piece of shrimp in the milk mixture, coating all sides completely.


Shake off excess milk from each piece before proceeding past this step.
 Transfer each piece of shrimp from the milk mixture to the flour mixture, turning to coat well on all sides.


Shake any excess flour coating off, as well.
 Transfer the shrimp into the hot oil and fry until golden brown.The shrimp should be opaque on the inside.
Only fry a few pieces at the same time. Do not crowd the fryer.
 Remove each piece of shrimp using a slotted spoon and let them dry on a baking sheet or platter lined with paper towels. Serve them after a few minutes, while still hot.

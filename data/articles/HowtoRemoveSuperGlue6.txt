 Use your fingernails to try to lift up at the ends of the glue stain. Once you get a small life, keep working at the stain and then try to roll it back off the plastic object. This may take a little effort but may be the best approach.









You can also use a plastic spatula or knife to help scrape off the glue without scratching the plastic.
 Make up a solution of warm, soapy water. Use a gentle dish washing detergent.









Dip a cloth or paper towel into the soapy water and drench it. Wring so that it's just damp.
Lay the cloth or paper towel over the glue stain. Tape a layer of kitchen plastic wrap over the cloth or paper towel, to create a humid micro-environment. Leave the items there for several hours. The damp cloth or paper towel will moisten the glue, causing it to soften a lot.
Use a warm, soapy cloth to remove the glue as much as possible after a few hours. Keep dabbing until all the glue lifts up onto the cloth.
 Note that this method may damage some surfaces, so it's best to do a spot test before proceeding.









Dampen a soft cleaning cloth with rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol).
Dab the cloth on the glue stain to soften.
Pick at the lifting, softened glue to remove as much as possible.
Use a fresh cloth dipped in soapy water to remove residue.
Wash with clean warm water to finish. Let dry.

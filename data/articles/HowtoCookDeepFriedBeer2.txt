 Place the yeast, water, and sugar into a mixing bowl and gently combine until all elements are dissolved.


Beat in 1 cup of the flour. Leave this to stand until it turns frothy.






Once frothy, add the salt, butter, and the remaining flour.







Knead the dough in the bowl to distribute the butter completely.




Beat the eggs well.






Use the egg mixture to brush the rolled-out sheets.






Using the ravioli cutter, press ravioli shapes out of the dough.
 Pair up the ravioli-cut shapes. Press them together on three sides to form a pocket. The egg-washed sides should be facing outward.


Use your thumb to hold the pockets open as you're pressing the sides together.
 Find a suitable way to prop up the pockets so that the open end is facing upward ready to receive the beer. Lean them against the side of a baking dish, a bowl, a cup, or similar item that you have handy. Carefully pour beer into each of the dough pockets.


Press each pocket closed to seal in the beer.
 Heat the oil in a pan until it reaches 325ºF/162.7ºC on the thermometer.


Add the beer pockets in small batches and fry quickly. They will cook in about 20 seconds.
 Place the fried beer pieces onto a paper towel to drain off excess oil.
 Allow the deep fried beer to cool for a few minutes. Once ready, pop a shot of fried beer!

 Use this method to avoid killing non-target animals such as dogs. You will need a cage trap or live trap to capture the mink.
 Unlike the locations in the other sets, you want to find a spot where the mink will not drown. Look for mink signs in the area.Place the trap away from open areas. This will prevent theft, vandalism, and distress to the animal.
 Make sure the hole is dark and deep. Mink are curious creatures and will be attracted to the hole. Make sure the hole is big enough to hold the cage.


Alternatively, you can place the cage in a pre-existing den or hole. If you are trapping the mink near your house, then place the cage in a dark area such as under.
 Press the cage deep into the ground or partially bury it to provide stability. Consider placing an anchor (such as a rock) inside of the cage so that it will not tip or misfire when the mink enters.


You can also use stakes or pegs to secure the trap to the ground

, Cover the cage with surrounding vegetation and debris (such as branches and leaves) to make it appear like a den. Place soil, leaves, branches, and other material on the cageâ€™s base to hide the treadle. Wrap the cage in something dark, like a blanket, if you can.
 Trip it several times to make sure it is functioning. Use a pen or pencil, stick the end through the side of the cage, and push down on the treadles to trip the cage. If you need the doors to close faster, use small stones or weights on top of the door., Use fresh fish or a dead muskrat. Place it at the back of the cage.


You can also use fish oil or raccoon glands as a lure.
 Minks are nocturnal creatures, so the best time to check for their capture is in the morning. Check the cage daily. This helps to prevent people from discovering the trap. It will also keep the mink out of the light and heat during the day.

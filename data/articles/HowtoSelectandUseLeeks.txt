 The best size for leeks is medium and they should appear crisp.;
, The presence of the roots indicates that the leek is still intact; if the base of the leek has been cut, the flesh begins to dry out.
 These leeks are not in their prime. If they are on a good special, however, they will do as a soup or stock base.



Start with the root end. Trim off the roots and the end that joins the roots.
Remove the outer leaves that are tough or dry - these leaves are usually a darker green.
Hold each leek under running water to flush out the dirt that becomes trapped between the leek leaf layers. It helps if you can fan out the leaves as you wash.
 Be conscious to cook leeks long enough - they can be very tough and stringy if undercooked. Equally, avoid cooking for too long or you will end up with a mushy consistency. If steaming or baking, only cook until tender. And for baking, always add moisture to the dish, whether it be water, stock, or juices from other food.
 Top with shave Parmesan cheese.
Bake leeks in water and lemon juice sprinkled with freshly milled black pepper;
Steam finely chopped or baby leeks and toss in a favourite dressing. Add fresh herbs as a garnish;

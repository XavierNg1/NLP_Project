 A bath can help to wash away any dirt or sweat that has accumulated on your baby. When you wash the old sweat away, your baby’s skin is less likely to react.
 Woolen clothes and blankets, rough fabrics, and furry stuffed animals are not recommended for a baby with sensitive skin.


Dress your baby in cool, lightweight materials to promote air circulation and to keep your baby’s sensitive skin from becoming irritated.
 If your baby has long nails, she is more likely to accidentally scratch herself, and cause skin irritation.
 Putting the clothes through a second complete wash cycle without detergent will minimize the amount of residue remaining on the fabric.
 Use a baby blow-dryer if necessary!

, Dry skin prevents moisture accumulation in the skin folds and heals the rash faster.

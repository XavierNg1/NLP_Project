Most products that are egg substitutes contain some egg., If the egg in the recipe you’re using is functioning as a binder, or an agent that makes other ingredients “stick” together, you will need to replace it with other items that serve the same function.Mashed banana or applesauce are healthy fruit options that can work as binders. Use half of a banana or ¼ of a cup of applesauce for each egg in the recipe.
One tablespoon of cornstarch or soy flour mixed with two tablespoons of water can be used as a replacement for each egg. One tablespoon of ground flax seed mixed with 4 tablespoons of water may also be used as a replacement binding agent.
Products in the baking aisle from the grocery store called “egg replacements” may be used. Follow product packaging instructions for quantity and procedures.
 Eggs often provide moistness to your cookies. To retain the moistness in your recipe, try substituting ¼ cup of vegetable or coconut oil for each egg in your recipe.

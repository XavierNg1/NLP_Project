 Measure out 1 tablespoon of pellet food per bird. You can also try giving the bird ½ tablespoon (7.3 ml) pellet food and ½ tablespoon (7.3 ml) seed mix. The majority of their diet should come from pellet food and/or seed mix.Try to feed the lovebirds at the same time each day. This will ensure they know when they are going to be fed.
 If you have more than one lovebird in a cage, provide one food bowl per bird. This will ensure there is no pecking or fighting over food at mealtime. It will also help you monitor the eating habits of each bird by checking their individual food bowls., Use clean running water to wash all fruits and vegetables. Then, cut them into small pieces and put them in a bowl that is separate from their food bowl. You do not need to peel the fruits or vegetables, as most lovebirds can digest the skin.Try to give the lovebirds a variety of different fruits and vegetables. Switch up the types of fruits and vegetables you give to the lovebirds.
Fruits and vegetables should make up 20-25% of the bird’s diet. Give them to the lovebirds as small snacks once or twice a day.
 Lovebirds need lots of fresh water. Put fresh water in their water bowls and refill it as needed. Make sure their water bowl is full before bed so they have access to fresh water at night.Always use water bowls that are shallow so your birds are not at risk of drowning.

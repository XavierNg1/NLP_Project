 You can do it in a fresh, new singleplayer world, on a server, or on a world that is a compilation of your Minecraft masterpieces.;
, You want to make sure it fits these 3 requirements:


Has a lot of space.
Has different biomes.
Has no giant hazards, such as a lava lake.
 2 or 3 are good numbers, but if you have a lot of time and space you could make 4 or even 5 clans.
 'SnowClan' would be good for a clan in a snowy biome, and 'TreeClan' would be good for woodlands.
 You could do this by placing a line of blocks, or placing one block occasionally. Make sure that each clan has enough territory to support themselves.
 You could have the dens dug into the ground, and line the camp with leaves, or you could even have the whole camp underground. You can even use abandoned monster caves as your clan's camp. It's up to you!

, This can be anything, as long as it can fit most of the cats in your clans, and there is a place for the leaders to stand to address the cats.
 Invite some friends over! Roleplay on it! Name your cats by using an anvil and a name tag (this will cost 1 experience point).

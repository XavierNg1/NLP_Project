 Since the Insec requires the use of wards, you must play on Summoners Rift, because Summoners Rift is the only map that has wards.;
, An Insec is a very fast series of actions. Using quick cast will make it much easier to accomplish. Once you have loaded into the game, open the settings page by hitting your Esc key on the keyboard. click the button that say “Quick Cast All,” and then click “Okay.”

, An Insec requires placing a ward and dashing to it. There is a variety of items that equip your champion with wards, but for this guide we will use a warding totem which is a trinket that can be purchased from the shop.
 Lee Sin is most commonly played as a Jungler, but you can play him in any lane you like. To perform an Insec you will need to unlock Lee Sin's Q (Sonic Wave), W (Safeguard), and R (Dragon’s Rage).
 When you are ready to Insec, hit an enemy champion with Sonic Wave.
 After Sonic Wave has hit the enemy champion, dash to them by press Q a second time.
 While traveling towards the enemy champion, place a Ward behind the enemy by moving your cursor to the desired location and using your trinket by pressing 4.
 After the ward has been placed, use Lee Sin's W to dash to it. This will position Lee Sin behind the enemy.
 Once behind the enemy, use Lee Sin’s Ultimate to kick the enemy toward your team by hovering your mouse cursor over the enemy and then press R.

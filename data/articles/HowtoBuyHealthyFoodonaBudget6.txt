 If the recipe you are making calls for half of a green pepper, plan a meal that will allow you to use the other half this week before it goes bad. This is an effective way to eliminate waste and stretch your food dollars.
 Although you may have to shell out a large sum of money at first, this method is actually less expensive in the long run because you can reuse the leftovers.

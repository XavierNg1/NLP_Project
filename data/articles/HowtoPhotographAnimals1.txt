 It is important to first understand and prepare your equipment, before you begin shooting. When photographing animals, there is a level of unpredictability, so knowing how to properly use your camera and gear is important for getting a great shot.You will want to be familiar with how to use a digital SLR camera and its features.
You should also know how to use other camera gear required, such as telephoto lenses for shooting from a distance. This is particularly handy for photographing wild animals.
Consider other gear, such as a tripod and a camera bag, for transporting your equipment.;
, If you are photographing wildlife, it will be beneficial to understand some of the habits and behaviours of the animal you are photographing. Learning about the animal will give you ideas for potential shots and make it easier to locate the animal in the wild.Know the habitat, footprints, calls, sleep patterns, etc. of the animal you want to photograph.
For example, knowing that Blue Jays live in eastern and central North America and have a distinct 'jay' call will be useful in locating Blue Jays to photograph.Alternatively, if you are photographing a pet or domestic animal, it is a good idea to spend some time getting to know the animal before you start taking photos. This will help relax the animal and you will be able to get more natural photos.
 Before you begin you should set up your equipment and take some test shots to make sure everything is in the right place. You can test lighting, angles, camera settings, etc. before you start photographing the animal.

If you are doing a staged shot you can set up any backgrounds or props that will be included.

 This is one of the newest and most powerful TI-83 emulators available, and can run on Windows, OS X, and Android.


You can download Wabbitemu for free from the developer's CodePlex page (wabbit.codeplex.com) as part of the WabbitStudio software package.

, A ROM is a file that contains the system image of the calculator. The Wabbitemu program does not come with a ROM for legal reasons. You can follow the prompts in the Wabbitemu setup program to create your own ROM from your own TI-83, or you can download one from a variety of locations online.


To find a TI-83 ROM online, simply search Google for "ti-83 rom" and select a result. Avoid sites that are laden with advertisements or that ask you to download extra files or programs. The ROM file will have a .rom extension.
 Wabbitemu doesn't install, it simply runs from the downloaded file. You will be prompted to choose the ROM file you downloaded or create your own ROM.


If you downloaded a ROM file, click Browse... and select it.
If you need to create your own ROM file, follow the prompts in the Wabbitemu program to create one. This will involve running a program on your TI-83 calculator to create the image file.
 This will display the calculator and the LCD display.
 You can now use the virtual TI-83 just as you would a real one. All of the virtual buttons perform the same functions as their real-world counterparts, and the emulator will actually process things much faster than your old calculator.

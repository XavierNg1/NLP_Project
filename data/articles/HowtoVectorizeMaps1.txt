 It has several problems:

The colors are very strong.
The letters are very difficult to read
The borders do not have the same width everywhere.
The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is not apparent.;
, You should see the image and a white rectangle with a black border. This rectangle is called the page. The page is the area where the drawing will show. It would be nice if the drawing occupied the entire page (File->Document Properties->Fit page to selection)., Simply click on an object or click any point and drag until a rectangle forms. Whatever is inside will be selected. You will see a dashed border with arrows surrounding it. If you click on the arrows, you resize the object. If you click on a selected object the arrows change to allow you to rotate the object.

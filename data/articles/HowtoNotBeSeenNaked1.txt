 Feeling self-conscious about your tummy? Try a corset to cinch your waist and push up your breasts, or a babydoll top for coverage and support. The important thing is to find something you like that highlights your best assets.Branch out beyond the usual lingerie styles, too. Consider burlesque-inspired, tomboy, and indie designers for new takes on sexy underthings.Costumes and role-playing may also help you stay covered while ramping up your bedroom activities.;
, It's helpful if your partner can come to your house, so you can feel a little less anxious and have more control over the environment. While you can simply turn the lights off, you may want to try a few candles or installing a dimmer switch. Low lighting is more flattering, and you and your partner can see enough of each other to feel intimate and connected.Use soft light bulbs in the bedroom, which can also provide more flattering light.
If you're having sex in the morning, wait to open the blinds or curtains, and leave the lights off. It may still be dark enough for you to feel comfortable.
 Leave your bra or t-shirt on. Or keep your skirt on but nothing else. Or even slip into your partner's shirt. Covering up a little can help make you feel comfortable enough that you still enjoy yourself.Some types of sex are perfect for staying clothed. If you initiate a sudden, passionate "quickie," you may not even have time to get your clothes off.
 If you're self-conscious about getting up to use the bathroom, keep a nice, fluffy robe within reach of your bed. If you don't have a robe available, pull a sheet or blanket off the bed and wear it under your arms like a towel.


This is another opportunity for you to pop on your partner's shirt, especially if he or she is a little larger than you are or about the same size.

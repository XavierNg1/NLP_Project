Read the Terms and Conditions and click "I Agree" to continue.
 From there you can title your stream, add a description, and put tags on it. Adjust the schedule for when you want to stream, or start streaming now!


Choose the privacy setting you want from the drop-down menu. If it's public, anyone can see your stream. If it's private, only specific accounts can view it.
 This allows the Hangouts plugin to access your webcam.


Custom should be reserved for those with coding knowledge since you have to use your own encoding program.
 This activates your webcam and launches Google+ Hangouts, so you'll be prompted to install the Google+ plugin if you don't already have it. You'll also have to grant Google+ access to your webcam.


The Hangouts window will launch, but you'll still have to wait for the video to buffer. Once the video is buffered a certain percentage, you'll be able to begin the broadcast. This should only take a minute or so.
 Click "OK" to confirm, and your stream will begin! You have up to eight hours to broadcast.


Use the "Control Room" option to manage your viewers. You can use this to mute or kick disruptive viewers.
 Click "Links" at the bottom of the Hangouts window to get the shareable link and embedding code. The stream will automatically show up on your YouTube Channel.

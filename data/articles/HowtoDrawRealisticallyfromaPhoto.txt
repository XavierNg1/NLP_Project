If you are drawing something more detailed, use a smaller grid.
For something less detailed, use a larger grid.;
, This grid should replicate the grid you've drawn over the image., Choose a square to begin with, then copy the outline of everything that it contains onto your drawing. Use the corresponding square on the drawing, to ensure that it will all piece back together properly.

Make sure the lines line up in the right places.
Hold off on any shading or detailing just yet. For now, just bring over the basic outline of each element in it.
 Once you have transferred the complete outline, you can begin to shade, add detail and correct any errors. You can erase the grid lines if you want, but once you shade and color your drawing, they probably won't show up anyway., Once you're happy with the detailing and shading, add color for the final part of preparing the drawing., Erase any guidelines from the grid that are still showing through, especially on the edges. Once you're happy with the finished picture, it's ready for display, framing, hanging or sharing online.

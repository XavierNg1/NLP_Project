 Create one mound for each rhizome you will be planting. The mounds should be spaced about 3 feet (0.9 m) apart, so the hops have plenty of room to grow.
 Dig a 4-inch hole in each mound. Plant the rhizomes horizontally, with the root side down. Mound soil over the rhizomes and loosely pack it down, then cover with straw or a light mulch to inhibit weed growth. Keep the soil consistently moist until the hops begin to sprout.
 When the hops emerge and grow about 6 inches (15.2 cm), they need to be "trained" around the trellis you are using to help them grow vertically. Place the trellis near the plants and gently wrap them around its base.


Continue training the hops for a few days. After awhile, they'll begin growing clockwise around the trellis on their own.
If some of the shoots that sprout look damaged or weak, remove them, rather than allowing them to take up space on the trellis. Each rhizome should produce between 4 and 6 healthy vines.
 After a few months of growth, trim the leaves off the bottom 4 feet (1.2 m) of the bines. This prevents the plants from getting damaged by diseases or fungus that may be present in the soil.
 As the vines begin to grow tall and strong, keep the soil around them weeded. Water the hops every day so that the soil stays moist, but not drenched. Continue caring for the hops in this way until late summer, when it's time to harvest them.

 You might want your song to be more than just your voice and a piano. If you do, you’ll need to add depth to your song by elaborating on what you already have. The most basic way to do this is to improvise. Listen to your song and add things where they seem to be needed.
 If your own improvisation doesn’t seem to be enough, you can get friends and fellow musicians together to see what a fresh set of eyes (and ears!) can bring to your work.
 These are variations of the main melody which can be added to give the melody a more fleshed-out feel. A counter-melody is best thought of as a separate melody which fits between the gaps of the first, where a harmony is meant to work in conjunction with the main melody line.
 Add more instruments to the background to give your song more depth. You can do this by adding percussion like drums, a small string quartet, chimes or flutes...the possibilities are almost endless! You can even add in sound effects like wind, thunder, or street noise. Just be sure that the style of the additional sound is in keeping with the style of song you have written.

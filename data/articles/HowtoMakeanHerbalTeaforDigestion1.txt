 Peppermint soothes irritated bowels and may reduce nausea. Even the cooling smell can be beneficial. Take a handful of leaves and rub them under running water to wash off dirt.;
, Crush a handful of peppermint leaves using a mortar and pestle, or any heavy tool. You don't need to pulverize the leaves, but the more you bruise them, the faster they will steep.
 Pour a mug of water into a small pot and heat over medium low. Add the leaves once the water is simmering.
 Once the water boils, turn off the heat and cover the pot. Let sit for a couple minutes so more of the peppermint infuses in the water.
 Pour the tea through a strainer and into your mug. Enjoy plain or add sugar. Drink hot.

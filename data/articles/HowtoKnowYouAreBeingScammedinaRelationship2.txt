 No one should ever ask you questions about your financial information. Never give this information away! This is a red flag if the person asks you these kinds of questions. If your date is asking a lot of questions about your money early in a relationship, they may only be interested in your money. These questions could be as direct as asking about your salary or as indirect as asking about the type of car you drive or neighborhood you live in., You are an easy target for dating scams when you are on vacation or temporarily living in a foreign country. Be aware that the culture and social cues surrounding dating may be different than those of your own country. Be wary of someone who becomes infatuated with you very quickly. They may have ulterior motives.Travelling alone is not usually a good idea because it may make you more susceptible to predators. Consider taking a friend along with you on vacations. You can have some time apart from the friend while on vacation, but make sure to check in with each other throughout the day, such as with a quick text message.
 Again, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is too good to be true. Be aware of people who are significantly younger than you or profess their love for you too quickly. Someone who is significantly younger than you might only be interested in a relationship for financial security. Remember that true love takes time, claims of “love at first site” could be a warning sign that you are being scammed.For example, if you are a 65-year-old retiree and a 25-year-old model is showing interest in having a relationship, it should raise suspicion.

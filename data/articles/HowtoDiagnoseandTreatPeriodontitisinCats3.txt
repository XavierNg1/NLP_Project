 Even if your cat does not have periodontitis, you should still brush their teeth once a day. Use a feline toothpaste or toothbrush, and apply a small amount of veterinary toothpaste before brushing their teeth., There are a few different types of oral rinses or solutions that you can give your cat to reduce tartar build-up. These come in gel and liquid form. Some may can squeezed into your cat’s mouth. Others may be sprayed.


Chlorhexidine is a common oral rinse given to pets. You can buy this in a gel or rinse form. Squeeze a little bit into the cat’s cheek. If you want, you can spread it around their mouth with a finger brush. Note, however, that some cats dislike the taste.At your pet store, you may be able to buy a liquid that you can add to your cat’s water bowl. These may be called "dental water" or "liquid tartar remover." Make sure to read the instructions carefully so that you add the right amount to their water.
 During a dental cleaning, your vet will remove any plaque or tartar on your cat’s teeth. They will also check your cat’s mouth, teeth, gums, and tongue for any problems. To do this, however, your cat will be put under general anesthesia.Dental cleanings are usually done every six months. Some vets may only ask you to come in once a year, however.Some groomers may offer “anesthesia free” dental cleanings. These cleanings are for cosmetic purposes only, and they will not help prevent periodontitis.

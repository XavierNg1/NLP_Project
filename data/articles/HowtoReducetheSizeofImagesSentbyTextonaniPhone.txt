 The switch will turn green when it's on. iMessage will now rescale all attached images to approximately 100kB, which is 10 to 50 times smaller in file size compared to a photo taken with an iPhone's camera.


Note that iMessage's file compression will reduce the image quality and resolution for a smaller file size. Although the reduction in image quality is not significant, you may want to check to see what your images look like in iMessage's Low Quality Image Mode before you decide to leave this setting on.

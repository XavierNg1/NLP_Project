 It is your responsibility to keep this accurately.
 Whenever you need to address the teams, use a clear voice that carries. Practice at home first! It is also really important to speak with confidence; there will be many times when your call will be questioned and you must feel confident about your judgment.
 When you need to blow the whistle, be sure to blow it with one clear, sharp blast. It must be audible to the players and it must be quick. Practice at home.
 This is where fitness is essential; to be able to make accurate judgment calls, you must keep with the action whilst not getting in the way of the action. This can take practice, but with time you'll improve.

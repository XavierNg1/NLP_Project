 Lower-cut tops will inherently show more of your breast, and are the perfect canvas for creating cleavage.


V-necks and scoop necks work well. The V-neck works especially well because it supports and frames your cleavage in a naturally flattering way.
 Empire waists and wrap tops are always good choices for creating cleavage.


An empire waist separates the bust from the waist, allowing the bust to stand out.
A wrap top hugs the curves of your chest and bustline, creating a fuller appearance.
When paired with a low neckline, these cuts can enhance the illusion of cleavage.
 Avoid baggy fabrics that drape across your chest, minimizing your bust.


Even if a baggier top has a low, revealing neckline, your chest will ultimately look flatter because parts of your bust are hidden beneath piles of material. The less fabric you use, the more your bust can stand out.
 Tailors can customize any dress or top to enhance the look of cleavage.


A professional tailor can help enhance cleavage by sewing some extra breast padding right into your clothing. A professional can also tailor your clothing to flatter your body and enhance the natural curves of your chest.
 Swimwear can be great for making and accentuating your bust. The elastic, clingy material in most swimsuits lends itself to the creation of cleavage.


Swimsuits with a halter top are great for showing cleavage. The closeness of the cups, tight material, and lift of the halter push the breasts together nicely.
Some swim tops are made with underwire and a little padding, like a bra. The underwire gives the chest some structure, and the padding creates a nice lift.
Try a bikini top with a really low front scoop. The scoop will expose more of your chest, making your breasts look larger. The elastic fabric of the top will also push your breasts together a bit.

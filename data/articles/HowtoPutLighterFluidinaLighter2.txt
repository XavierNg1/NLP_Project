 Zippo lighters are generally made to be reusable. In order to refill a zippo lighter, you'll need zippo lighter fluid, a small flathead or pin, and a zippo lighter. You can buy lighter fluid online, or at the store where you purchased your zippo lighter., Open the case of your zippo lighter. Grab the edge of the lighter and pull it out of its case. It might be a little hard to get out if itâ€™s a newer lighter.
 There is a small lever on the bottom of a zippo lighter that reads "lift to refill." Use your fingers to lift this lever. If you can't get it opened using your fingers, this is where you would use a pushpin or flathead to lift the lever.
 Now, take your bottle of lighter fluid. Insert the nozzle of the bottle into the compartment just under the lever. Squirt some fluid into the lighter. Do this just until the padding on the inside of the lighter is damp. Once you're done, close the lever.
 Once you're done, reinsert your lighter into the case. It should not be ready for use. Under no circumstances should you light your zippo lighter when its out of its case. Lighter fluid may have dripped during the process. You could end up burning your hand or causing the lighter to explode.

 Around the mark of nine months to go, start researching your wedding dress ideas. Are you having one custom made, altering an heirloom dress or purchasing off-the-rack? Whichever way, you'll possibly need several fittings and adjustments to perfect it. Alternatively, make your own or steer clear of traditional wedding dresses and buy a dress that you simply love and know you can wear again after the wedding. You don't have to stick with tradition or spend a fortune on something you'll never use again.


Select a wedding veil if you're having one. And don't forget the shoes––from flip flops to diamond encrusted satin slippers, what's your preference and do they need special effort or will you buy them ready-made?
Decide on bridesmaid's dresses at the same time. Are you paying for them or will they pay? You have less say over their choices if they pay but they're more likely to be happy with choosing their own style within your color choice.
In some religions, it is traditional that the mother of both the groom, and bride comes to find the dress, as well as the maid of honor. This varies widely depending on where you live and what your faith is.
Get tuxes and groomsmen clothing sorted and ordered about four months prior to the wedding. Send tux measurement forms to groomsmen a month before fittings.
 This is a fun task to do together, and symbolizes your devotion to each other. Most couples get matching rings to show that they complete one another's soul. If you're having rings specially made up, leave plenty of time and be prepared to get to learn more than you ever cared to know about gold and the origins of it (as in, whether or not it has been sourced equitably and so forth). Make the right decisions by doing your research.


Wedding ring selection should take place around five months before the wedding, with collection of the rings occurring about one month in advance of the date.

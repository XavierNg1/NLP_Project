 There is always a solution, even if it is feeding the disaster to the chickens or demonstrating to your kids how not to bake a cake. Focus on what you can do before racing down to the store to buy a last minute substitute.


Always learn from your mistakes. Cake baking is an art and mistakes are all lessons in perfecting the art. Enjoy the mistakes as much as the successes, for they turn you into a better baker!

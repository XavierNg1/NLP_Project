, The last band on the poster should be the first band playing (and usually is the most unknown).
 Usually you will have the headlining band's name a bit bigger than the others. Plan the fonts your going to use, and a small graphic/logo gives creative flair.
 If you aren't familiar with the band then just use a quirky but simple font.
, Next should come the time the doors open, NOT the time the gig begins at. You need people to get there on time, not when the first band plays.
 After this have the cost of entry, this and the above two details should be fairly big, as they are important.


In smaller writing, you're going to need to put three details, these are as follows.

The age of which the patrons must be to enter the gig, ie. "All ages" or "Over 18's only". This is important as your patrons may be asked for ID at the door.
Next you can put whether alcohol will be served at the gig or not.
After that, you can put "Right of Admission Reserved". This will cover you or the gig organizer in the case of not allowing someone in, for one reason or another.

These three details may be smaller print, as they are important, but are only on the poster for legal reasons.
 As you are the person who made the poster, you may be asked to make posters for people in future and this can help with a bit of self advertisement.
 are simple but effective on your poster. Or if you have been asked to use something specific use that. Place it somewhere on your poster that won't take away from the details but will add a nice bit of creativity to it.,

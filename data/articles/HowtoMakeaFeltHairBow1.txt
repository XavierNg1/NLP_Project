 Cut out two round pieces of felt. Make one piece a little smaller than the other. The circle sizes depend on how large you'd like the bow to be, but a good size would be about 10cm or 4 inches diameter.;
, Put the smaller circle on top of it.
 Take both fingers and pull inward from both edges of the top and bottom of the circle. This will cinch the bow shape together. Stitch it to hold permanently.
 Cut a length of ribbon and glue along the exposed clip, to cover it and make the clip more comfortable against the head when worn. Allow to set before adding the next features.
 Fold it into a bow with long tails.
 Allow to dry.


If you like, the ribbon can be tied around the center, over the clip piece, for added strength.
 Use pliers to snap it off. Glue the button to the dead center of the felt bow, on top of the center of the black velvet ribbon bow. Allow to dry.
 The felt bow is now ready to wear and enjoy.

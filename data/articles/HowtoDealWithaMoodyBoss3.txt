 When your boss is in a bad mood, work to stay as calm and tranquil as possible. If you cannot leave the situation, take a few deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth. If you can make an escape, take a walk around the block, go get a snack, or even take your lunch break. Doing so will prevent you from lashing out., Though you cannot avoid them entirely, you can certainly limit your interactions. Instead of popping in their office to ask a question, send an email instead. If you tend to end up in the elevator with them in the mornings, take the stairs instead or arrive a few minutes earlier., It is much harder to deal with other people when you're sleep deprived or hungry. Daily exercise, regular and healthy sleep patterns, and nutritionally sound eating are crucial in dealing with difficult people because you'll feel strong in body and mind, and you won't easily succumb to the stress.
 Humor can greatly boost your own mood as well as general office morale. Take some time during your difficult work day to laugh. You can watch funny videos online, find some hilarious memes on social media, or call up a friend of yours who is sure to make you laugh.


With your coworkers, avoid making jokes about your boss, however.
 If your bossâ€™s mood is affecting your health and you have already spoken to them, then it is time to make a report or find a new job. If others in your department have reported them as well, it may be worth it to wait it out before finding alternative employment in case your boss is fired.If your boss ever hits you, is sexually inappropriate, or verbally abusive, report them immediately. Do not wait it out.
An example of verbal abuse would be if your boss calls you stupid or uses racial slurs.

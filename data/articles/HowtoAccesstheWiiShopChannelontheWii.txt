,, Without an Internet connection, you cannot load the Shopping Channel.
 There may be some sort of fail-safe that prohibits you from loading the Shopping Channel on account of hacking it to get some Channels for free, whether or not this was your intention.
 It shouldn't be a weak signal or the Shopping Channel won't stay loaded.

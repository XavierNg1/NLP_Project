 For this card, a simple, blank card works really well. There’s no need to get flashy. A nice thick brown or beige card with some texture to it will work well.
 Using a fine-point marker write out, in your best handwriting, a phrase or word that you think fits your mom.


It could be something like “Love You,” or “Love,” or even “Thanks!”

, Using a pin, poke the holes about a ¼ inch apart. Make sure that your card is open and you’re only poking holes through one piece of the paper. Take your time and go slow. If you rush you could miss a few areas. Just follow your tracing.


When poking the holes, do it on top of a piece of cardboard as a cushion.
You don’t have to be super precise with the holes, just aim to evenly space each one out.
Be very careful when poking the holes as you could prick yourself.
 Use two pieces of floss so that your word or phrase really stands out. Make sure to tie a knot at the other end of your floss.


Give yourself plenty of floss to work with. You’ll cut away the extra floss at the end.
You can get embroidery floss in a variety of colors. Get a color that your mom would like, like her favorite color.
You could also get two different colors if you wish and combine.
 Once you feel the knot hit the back, or inside, of the card, continue threading the needle and floss through the rest of the holes.


If you wrote in cursive and have parts of letters or words that overlap, make sure that you bring the floss over and not under the area you already threaded. This will make the card look neater.
Sew through the rest of the holes. Once you’re finished, tie off a knot and cut extra floss.
 Finish your card by writing a nice note on the inside. Try to write her a note that reflects the word or phrase you sewed on the outside.


Once you’ve written your note, you’re ready to place the card in the envelope and give it to your mom.

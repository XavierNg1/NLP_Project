 First, that is, after you possess a marriage certificate, divorce decree, or court order. Taking this step before moving on to your driver’s license and other identity documents makes the process much easier.


Visit a Social Security Administration office, and bring the following: completed Form SS-5 (Application for a Social Security Card, available at the office or online);a certified name change document (marriage license, divorce decree, or court order); a valid, government-issued photo ID; and proof of citizenship (birth, citizenship, or naturalization certificate). The full list of acceptable documents is available online.You can also complete the process by mail, if you send certified copies of the certificates (not just photocopies of them).
 This can be done only in person at an Illinois Secretary of State (SOS) office. Bring the following:


Your current license / ID card.
Your certified name-change document (same as in previous step).
A form of payment (the fee is $5).
You can also find information about changing your voter registration card and your vehicle title and registration at the SOS office or online., With a certified name-change document, a new Social Security card, and a new driver’s license, the process should be simple — if likely more time-consuming than you’d prefer.


You should be able to change your name on bank accounts by providing your certified name-change document and new driver’s license; you may also need your new Social Security card as well, so bring it along.
The list of notifications you need to make after this point depends upon the particulars of your life. Lists of common stops on the name-change parade are available online.Also available online are numerous sites that offer to do the name-changing drudgery for you, usually for about $30 and above.

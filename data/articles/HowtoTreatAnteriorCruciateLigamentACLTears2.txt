 If you want to avoid getting surgery done on your torn ACL, you can try doing physiotherapy on your knee. Progressive physical therapy and rehabilitation can be a good option for people who are only moderately active, older than 65, or willing to stop doing high impact sports. Physiotherapy is often recommended if you still have some stability in your knee and your ACL is only partially torn, not completely torn.Speak to your doctor about doing physiotherapy to treat your ACL tear. They can likely recommend a good physiotherapist that you can work with to improve your ACL and recover from this injury.
 Meet with the physiotherapist and come up with a plan to treat your injury. You will need to commit to a recovery program that can last at least six to 10 months and do exercises with your physiotherapist to strengthen your knee. The physiotherapist should keep you updated on your progress and let you know if your ACL tear is improving over time.If you are an active, athletic person, you may opt for surgery so your knee can be fully repaired and you can return to doing sports or other activities more quickly.
Some people who opt for physiotherapy over surgery can end up developing secondary knee injuries or a torn meniscus, which will require surgery to fix.
 Another rehabilitation option is to invest in a custom knee brace that you can wear when you stand or walk. The knee brace can help to protect and support your knee. You can also use the knee brace as part of your physiotherapy plan.Keep in mind that many people with ACL tears who use knee braces do not have a very large range of movement and are not able to do any strenuous activity while standing. You may not do well with a knee brace if you are an athlete or very active.

 Use a strong brush or sponge to remove any dirt under running water, then peel off the skin. Note that you can leave some skin as well for a little change of taste, as most Lay's chips still have a little bit of skin left on them. It's your choice., Mandolins set to the thinnest setting are always the best option, as you'll get perfectly even, thin chips. However, you can use a knife if you work slowly and carefully. The thinner the better.
 The salty water draws out moisture, which allows the potatoes to crisp up perfectly when cooked.
 Remove the sliced potatoes from the water and lay them on paper towels to dry. Pat the tops with more paper towels to fully dry them.
 You're aiming to get the temperature to roughly 350F/175C, which you can do with a deep fryer or a candy thermometer. If you don't have one of those, you can still find the right temperature easily:


Drop a 1" (2.5cm) cube of bread into the hot oil. If it browns in about 75 seconds, your oil is the perfect temperature.
Drop a kernel of popcorn in the oil as it heats. You're ready to fry once it pops., You may have to do 2-3 batches to prevent them from sticking or crowding up the pan. You want to cook them until they just start to brown -- they will cook a little bit longer once you remove them, so take them out just before they are perfect.Use a mesh scooper or a slotted spoon to remove the chips but keep the oil in the pan.
 Blot gently with paper towels to remove excess oil, then toss with salt immediately, while still hot, for the best flavor. Let them cool while you finish other batches, and enjoy!

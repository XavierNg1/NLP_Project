 Get your chores done on time and don't be sneaky. Just imagine a girl such as Applejack cheating on a test or skipping chores to watch TV. She would never do something like that. Be true to your friends and never double cross them! Having good family tie is also important.
 No fancy heels or jewels for this lady! If you feel like you can't part with elegant or frilly things, then maybe your pony inspiration should be Fluttershy or Rarity. Instead, try not to wear makeup. If you must, make it impossible to tell you are.
 It takes skill to dress as Applejack would without looking as though you might be in a costume.


Don't wear a hat; that is too over the top. Wear plaid boyfriend shirts in warm colors.
Keep the look simple. Light blue jeans or jean shorts are all you need for pants.
Loosely ponytail your hair. Bandana around the girl's neck is cute as well.
 Do not fake any accent. Only use a Southern accent if you live/have lived in the South. Still, call your close friends "honey" or "sugar-cube", and avoid squealing or going "OMG" every second!

, That is the opposite of Applejack, not like her at all. Don't be so honest that you hurt people. Know when to stop.

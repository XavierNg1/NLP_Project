 Playing any of the other balls before the spotted ball has been pocketed must be corrected by replacing all balls as they were before the shot. Pocketing any of the other balls before the spotted ball allows the opponent to choose any 2 of his own balls and pocket them by hand into his object pocket. Play passes to the other player.
 If you knock a ball off of the table, replace it in the dead center of the table, where it will be surrounded by bumpers. Play passes to the other player.
 If you knock an opponent's ball off of the table, replace it in the position it was before the shot and place 1 of your own balls in the dead center of the table. Play passes to your opponent.
 If a player pockets an opponent's ball, it will count as a ball pocketed by the opponent.
 If a player pockets a ball in the object pocket of the opponent, the opponent chooses 2 of her own balls and pockets them by hand into her own object pocket. If a player scores the last ball into the object pocket of the opponent, the player loses the game.

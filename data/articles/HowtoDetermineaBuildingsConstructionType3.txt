 ISO Class 2 encompasses IBC Type IIIA and IBC Type IIIB. Regardless of whether the IBC classification is A (protected) or B (unprotected) the ISO Class is 2. IBC Type IV is Heavy Timber construction and is considered ISO Class 2. The reason is that the heavy timbers perform well and do not fail early in a fire.
 There are several types of masonry used in the exterior bearing walls of joisted masonry buildings:


brick
concrete — either reinforced or non reinforced
hollow concrete masonry units
tile
stone
note that exterior bearing walls may also be any noncombustible materials with fire-resistance ratings of not less than one hour

, Heavy timber construction uses wood members much larger than those found in frame (Construction Class 1) or other joisted masonry construction. If the building uses steel columns or beams for walls, the beams must be protected so they have a fire-resistance rating of not less than one hour. Heavy Timber Construction (IBC Type IV); ISO classifies the building as heavy timber construction if it meets these requirements:


walls of masonry construction
floors of 3 inch (7.6 cm) wood plank or 4 inch (10.2 cm) laminated plank, both surfaced with 1 inch (2.5 cm) flooring
roof of 2 inch (5.1 cm) wood plank, 3 inch (7.6 cm) laminated plank, or 1-1/8 inch tongue-and-groove plywood deck
wood column supports not less than 8 inch (20.3 cm) x 8 inch (20.3 cm), wood beams or girders not less than 6 inch (15.2 cm) x 6 inch (15.2 cm), or protected metal

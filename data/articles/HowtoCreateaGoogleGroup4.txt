 Examples of settings you can configure are message moderation preferences, the view of the group as seen on a web page, and more.
 This option will allow you to specify how you want group members to be identified when they post to the group. For example, you can choose to have the email addresses of group members displayed within posts.
 Listing your group in the Google directory will allow other users to find and join your group. You can also limit your group to an adult-only audience.
 You can choose whether or not you want all content to be reviewed by you or another administrator before it is published to the group. For example, if you want all swearing banned from the group, you can choose to moderate all content and review each new post for offending words.
 In the web view settings, you can choose to sort replies by popularity, or allow users to assign "tags," or categories to certain discussions. For example, if your Google Group is about various crafts, you can allow users to sort posts by craft type; such as quilting, knitting, and scrapbooking.

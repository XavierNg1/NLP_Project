 If you know you need to miss a court date, contact your lawyer and ask them to get your date adjourned (put off) or rescheduled for an earlier time. Do this as soon as you can.


If you don't have a lawyer, call the court. Explain why you cannot attend, and ask for your court date to be rescheduled.
You may be asked to present material evidence, such as a doctor's certificate.
 If you know you cannot make a court date, or if you already missed a court date, you can be excused for being medically unfit or undergoing a medical emergency. Ask your doctor or an emergency room attendant for a certificate or a medical report. Ask for it to be verifiable: for instance, it should be signed by your doctor, or printed on official stationary. The date should be included.


Present this to your lawyer or to the judge. Another acceptable excuse is that you got into a car accident or there was some sort of natural disaster. You'll need to provide evidence that this was indeed the case.
 If you missed a date, there may be a warrant out for your arrest. Go to the local police station or go directly to the court where you missed your date. Present yourself in court with verifiable evidence that you were unable to attend, such as a medical certificate or medical report from the date in question.If you are a charged with an offense for having failed to attend, get legal help before making your plea.

 The best way to lock moisture into your skin is to smooth on your moisturizer right after you finish taking a shower or bath. Pat your skin dry with a clean towel, and apply the moisturizer while your skin is still slightly damp to trap the moisture and keep it hydrated.Practice the same routine whenever you wash your face or hands to keep those areas hydrated as well.
 Lotion moisturizers are often too thin and watery to provide significant moisture to the skin. Keep dryness at bay by using a thick ointment or cream moisturizer, which can deliver intense hydration so your skin stays smooth and irritation-free.Look for moisturizer that contain natural oils that mimic skin oils, such as jojoba or olive oil. Shea butter is also an effective natural moisturizer.
Other moisturizer ingredients that can help soothe dry skin include glycerine, hyaluronic acid, mineral oil, dimethicone, lactic acid, urea, petrolatum, and lanolin.
 If you have severely dry spots, such as your feet or elbows, overnight moisturization may be necessary. Use a particularly heavy moisturizing agent, such as petroleum jelly or even vegetable shortening, and slather it over the areas. Next, cover the skin with clothing and go to sleep. Your skin will have all night to soak up the extra moisture.Because the moisturizer may stain the clothing, be sure to wear a pair of old socks, gloves, pajamas, or an old-long-sleeve tee to avoid ruining good clothing.
Itâ€™s also a good idea to put old sheets on your bed in case any of the moisturizer comes into contact with your bedding.

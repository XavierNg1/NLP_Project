 This is one of the most popular programs for editing images, and also one of the most powerful. Resizing a picture can be done in a few simple steps.;
,, In the menu that appears, you will see 2 boxes that read "Width" and "Height." Next to these boxes are drop-down menus that let you pick the units you are specifying; you can resize a picture by pixels, inches (or centimeters), or percentage. If you don't have a specific size in mind, choose the percentage option.
 After choosing percentage, type in a number less than 100 in the "Width" and "Height" boxes to shrink the picture. For example, typing "50" will make your image 50 percent as big as it was before. Click the "OK" button.
 Click on "File" from the toolbar and then click "Save."

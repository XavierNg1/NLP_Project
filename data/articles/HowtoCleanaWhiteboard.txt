 Pen and permanent marker will leave permanent marks on a whiteboard that can be very difficult to remove. Even dry erase marker that's left on for too long will stain the board. To remove such stains, start by completely writing over the stains with fresh dry erase marker., This should only take a few seconds.Then, rub the marks with a cloth or the whiteboard eraser.


The idea is that the fresh dry erase ink will help loosen and lift the stains off the board, so that when you wipe away the dry erase ink, the permanent marks will come off as well.
 For stubborn stains and permanent marks, repeat the process. Cover the marks again with dry erase ink, allow it to dry, and then rub the board with a cloth or eraser.
 Once you have removed the permanent stains or marks, clean the board to remove any remaining marks. Dampen a cloth with a cleaner and wipe the board vigorously with the damp cloth. Remove any excess cleaner and allow the board to dry. Some of the most popular cleaners for a whiteboard are:Isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol
Hand sanitizer
Acetone or nail polish remover that contains acetone
Water mixed with several drops of dish soap.
Orange cleaners (such as Goo Gone and Fantastik)
Glass cleaner
Baby wipes
Pam or other spray cooking oils
Aftershave
Whiteboard cleaning solution like Expo, Solutions MB, or Quartet

, Start with a whiteboard eraser, which will remove the majority of fresh marks, as long as they haven’t been there for more than a couple days., Dampen a clean cloth or sponge with your favorite cleaning solution. Be sure you’re in a ventilated area if you are going to use harsh chemicals. Use the cloth to apply cleaning solution to the whiteboard and rub vigorously., Once you have successfully removed the marker, rinse out your cloth or sponge with clean water to remove the cleaning solution. Wring out the cloth and wipe the board down with the damp cloth. This will remove excess cleaning solution. Then, dry the board with a clean, dry cloth.

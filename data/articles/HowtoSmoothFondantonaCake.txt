 Fondant can be homemade or bought. Remove the fondant from any plastic, paper, and so forth. Lay it on a clean cooking space and knead well to help the fondant stay together and not crumble.;
, Flour your surface and gently push the fondant down, making it the shape of a pancake. Use a rolling pan to make the fondant stretch until thin. Avoid rolling too much, however, because the fondant will tear when being added on the cake.
 Using a butter knife, spread a thin layer of butter cream frosting on the cake. Butter is greasy and can stick really well which helps the fondant stay on the cake.
 Gently and carefully lay the fondant on the cake like you are laying a blanket. Close the bottom edges and try your best to make everything even to avoid wrinkles or clumps.
 With a smoothing tool, smooth the sides and top of the cake to make it straighten. Don't use your hands, they leave fingerprints and other shapes on the cake. Smoothing helps the fondant not bubble.
 Use a pizza cutter to cut of the excess edges, going around slowly. You can store the extra fondant for later use.

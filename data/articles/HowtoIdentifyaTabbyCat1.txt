 Classic tabby cats tend to have blotchy patterns across the body, leading some people to colloquially refer to classic tabbies as "blotched tabbies"., The stripes on a classic tabby cat tend to be wider and thicker than on other varieties of tabbies. Those thicker lines can contribute to the blotchy pattern that is characteristic of classic tabbies., The distinct tabby lines appear circular or swirling on classic tabbies. On some cats they may even resemble a bullseye pattern., Typical tabby cats have black stripes over an otherwise brown coat. Other color variations do occur, but these typically have the qualifying color added before the word tabby, such as a ginger or red tabby (shades of orange and white) or a blue tabby (gray and white).

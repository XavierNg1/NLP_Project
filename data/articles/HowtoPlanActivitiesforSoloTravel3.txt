 Dining alone can feel uncomfortable, but it doesnâ€™t have to. Try sitting at a lunch counter or bar. This way you will be seated next to strangers and you can easily try and strike up a conversation. You can also talk with the bartender or other servers as they are working. This is a great way to meet people and sit in a restaurant without feeling lonely., Another thing you can do while dining alone is bring something to occupy your mind. For example, if you are out for lunch or breakfast you could try reading a newspaper or doing a crossword while you eat.Alternatively, you could bring a notebook to dinner with you. Write down notes about your day or some of the food you are eating.
You could also try reading a novel while you wait for your meal to arrive.
 If you go to a restaurant during a busy time as a solo traveler, you may get seated with other singles or at a larger group table. This is a great way to meet local people and engage in conversation while dining. You could also try frequenting the same restaurant. This way the staff will get to know you and you will become comfortable chatting with them.

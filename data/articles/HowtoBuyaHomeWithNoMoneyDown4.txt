 This is another way to potentially purchase a house with little or no money down. Also known as an option or "rent to own," this is an opportunity for you to rent a home you eventually plan to purchase, with a percentage of the rent paid going toward a down payment on the property.The rent on an optioned house is going to be above market (because you are also paying toward the down payment), so it may not be worth it to enter this arrangement unless you have your heart set on that particular house., People who have struggled to sell their home and are motivated may be more open to this arrangement.Keep an eye out for a house that has been on the market for a long time.
 While this can be a great arrangement for some, it is not for everyone. Be aware that there are risks involved with renting to buy, namely that, should you choose not to purchase the home, you will not get back any of the option money back, losing whatever you paid toward the down payment. It does mean that, should you change your mind, you are under no obligation to buy the house at the end of the lease.Make sure you have the home inspected before signing the lease or, at the very least, before buying the house. An appraisal will ensure you are paying a fair price for the home and you'll also find out if the house needs any major repairs. If there is major work to be done, it might be best not to enter into such an agreement, since the repairs may cost you quite a bit.Make sure you have agreed who will be responsible if anything happens to the house while you are leasing., You will need a standard lease agreement, plus an option to purchase.Because the title to the house remains with the original owner until the house is actually purchased, you will need a lease agreement as you would with any tenant/landlord situation. In addition, the option to purchase will grant the tenant the option to purchase the house after a predetermined amount of time.This includes the option fee, which is either paid upfront or as the higher-than-market rent.Both parties should have a lawyer review the contracts and make sure the following is established:Length of the lease period
Rent amount
Percentage of rent going toward down payment and how it will be held (usually in escrow)
What will happen if the renter decides not to buy at the end of the lease period (usually the renter loses the option money)
Who will pay for repairs, utilities, etc. (usually the tenant)
Who will pay property taxes, insurance and homeowner fees
What happens if the home value rises or falls between the time you sign the agreement and the end of the lease

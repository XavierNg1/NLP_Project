 While employers will require an SSN, it is possible to make small amounts of money as a self-employed person without having an SSN.The typical rule is that if you earn more than $400 in the course of a year as a self-employed person, you are required to file a return, and would therefore require an SSN.
Note that while it may be tempting to be paid in cash for doing small jobs, or even running a small business, this is ultimately illegal. The IRS can audit you, and will be able to identify unreported cash income using your bank statements, or by noting any discrepancies between income and lifestyle or assets.
 It is possible to make under $400 without reporting, and therefore you can find jobs that would pay under that. There are multiple options to consider.


Quick jobs include babysitting, mowing lawns, shoveling snow, walking dogs, or doing small repairs or odd jobs for friends or family.
Consider what your skills are, and target your jobs to tasks that fall within what you are good at.
 The best way to locate potential customers is to start by asking friends or family. They may need odd jobs done, or know somebody needs odd jobs done.


Consider printing flyers as well, or handing them door-to-door. If, for example, you want to quickly make some money mowing lawns, you can print out posters advertising your services and price, and place them on telephone polls. You can also hand them out to individuals who you feel may need the service, such as elderly people, or individuals who have busy lifestyles.

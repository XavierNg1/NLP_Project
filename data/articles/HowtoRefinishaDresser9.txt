 Linseed oil is the most common oil used for oiling furniture pieces but there are other oils available––ask your retailer for specific advice.
 The dresser should be finely sanded and any blemishes treated with a filler that exactly matches the wood.


If there are any stains or color variations in the wood, stain these to match the surrounding wood before proceeding.
 Use a normal wide paintbrush that you'd use for painting the dresser. Be generous––the wood will soak up the oil to begin with.
 These areas need more oil.
 The time for this varies between 15-45 minutes, depending on the timber, its age and condition, and the oil. The humidity and temperature will also impact the time it takes for the oil to penetrate the wood––it will likely be faster in warmer weather and slower when cooler.
 Brush on a new layer of oil. The dresser will need about 5 to 6 layers of oil to provide a sufficiently durable surface. The finish will also look better for more oil layers.
 Place it back in its usual spot, ready for reuse. Keep an eye on its condition; oiled surfaces are the one surface that will need regular maintenance to keep the sheen. Rub in more oil every few months or half yearly, to keep the oiled appearance at its best and to continue protecting the dresser.

When cleaning, rub with the grain. Add a few drops of oil to restore sheen for cleaning, and simply buff.

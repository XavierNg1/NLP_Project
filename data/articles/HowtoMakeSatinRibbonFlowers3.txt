 You can make a straightforward satin ribbon flower using just one piece of satin ribbon. Cut the ribbon into one strand that is approximately 12-inches long. You will also need to gather together a needle and some thread, some scissors and some glue. Find something to use as the centre of the flower, such as a button., Take the ribbon and a threaded needle. Weave the needle through the ribbon along one of the long edges. Weave the needle, in and out, all the way through the length of the ribbon.








The stitch to use here is known as a basting stitch., Once you have woven the needle all the way along the ribbon, pull the thread through and pull it tight. When you do this you will see the ribbon bunch up and begin to take on a flower shape. Cut the thread and tie it off with a double knot at one end.









Pull it as tight as you can, and then tie off the other end of the thread.
Fix the two ends of the ribbon together with glue, or by stitching them. Glue might be neater, but be sure to glue on the side of the ribbon you want to be on the back., If you used glue, leave it to dry before flattening it out. It should now look like the petals of a flower. To finish it off, get your centrepiece button and place it over the hole in the centre of the flower. Use a glue gun or some superglue to stick this to the ribbon, taking care to keep it neat and tidy.









You may find it helpful to use two buttons, one or either side of the flower.
You can then glue the two buttons together to secure the flower.

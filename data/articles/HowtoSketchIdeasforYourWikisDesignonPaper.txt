 Your topic should be what your wiki is about (and not already taken), and your mission statement should describe your goals for your wiki.;
, It can include one or more featured articles of the day (which almost all wikis have), help pages for the 'newbies,' a button that allows anyone to create an account or log in, and some access to different article categories. You want your wiki's homepage to look creative, and attract readers and community members.
 These should be sets of rules which all of your wiki's contributors must adhere to, including its administrators. Suggestions for policies and guidelines include:



Username policy - Write rules for usernames that can and cannot be created. Usernames that cannot be created can include abusive usernames, names of celebrities and any name that is too long and nonsensical.

Blocking policy - Write rules for when an editor should and shouldn't be blocked. Times when an editor should be blocked include when he/she is part of an edit war, continues to vandalize pages after multiple warnings and repeatedly posts personal attacks and abusive comments to other users.
 Since being a new contributor can be intimidating, and new members of a wiki may have no idea what the wiki is about, they might want to look at help pages. These pages can include a page of frequently asked questions (FAQ) and some guidelines on understanding what the wiki is and is not. You can also provide a tour, which teaches a new contributor how the wiki works.
 This should be a page where any contributor can practice their editing skills, and they can make any edit they wish, except for anything offensive or libelous. Sketch out some guidelines to using the sandbox, including what edits that contributors cannot make, and creating a personal sandbox (a sandbox in a user's userspace).

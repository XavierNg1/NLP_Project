 You can find it at goo.gl. The set up won't be quite as fancy at Bitly's, but it can still get the job done if you're simply interested in shortening a URL., Begin by copying and pasting the original link into the text box that says "Paste your long URL here." Then click the "Shorten URL" button to the right. Google will create a list a shortened URLs below. You may wish to hide any of your shortened URLs by checking the boxes next to them and clicking the Hide button below the list.
 You'll find a column in your list of shortened links that tells you how many clicks each link has received. By clicking on Details, Google will show you information charting the links' performance over time along with the countries, browsers and platforms from which they've been clicked.

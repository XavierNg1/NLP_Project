 Pour 6 tablespoons of olive oil into a large saucepan or pot over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, add 1 medium chopped onion (about 1 1/2 cups). Stir and cook the onion for about 4 minutes or until it softens a little. Add 3 large cloves of minced garlic and cook it for one minute. Stir in 2/3 cup of fresh chopped parsley and cook the aromatic base for 2 more minutes.It's important not to add the garlic when you first put the onions in the pan. Garlic cooks very quickly, so you'll only want to add it right before you add the parsley and remaining stew ingredients.;
, Open one 14-ounce (411 g) can of tomatoes with their juices and add it to the saucepan. If you don't want to use canned tomatoes, you could use 1 1/2 cups of freshly chopped tomatoes (from about one medium-sized tomato). Stir in 2 teaspoons of tomato paste and let the stew simmer gently for 10 minutes.If you're buying canned diced tomatoes, ensure that they're packed in tomato juice.
 Add 8 ounces (240 ml) of clam juice (or shellfish stock), 1/2 cup dry white wine (like Sauvignon blanc), and 1 1/2 pounds (680 g) of fish fillets cut into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces. Turn the heat up a little so the stew bubbles a bit and cook the stew for 3 to 5 minutes. The fish should be completely cooked and should flake a apart when you poke it with a fork.Avoid using a delicate fish like sole or tuna. Instead, consider using a firm fish like tilapia, halibut, cod, red snapper, or sea bass.
You could also add shrimp, clams or scallops to make a seafood stew.
 Add one pinch of dried oregano, one pinch of dried thyme, 1/8 teaspoon of hot sauce, and some salt and pepper. Taste the quick fish stew and adjust the seasonings to your liking. Serve the stew along with:Crusty bread
Rice
Rolls
Crackers

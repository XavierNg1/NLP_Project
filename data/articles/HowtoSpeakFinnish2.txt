 Learning a language like Finnish requires you to study frequently. Studying for even ten minutes a day can help speed up your language learning. Set a schedule for yourself to study, and stick with it. Some tricks you can try include:


Study vocabulary before you go to bed and after you wake up. This may help aid with memory.
Listen to Finnish music and radio while you cook, clean, or drive.
Set a time everyday where you go through your grammar exercises.
Set up weekly study sessions with other Finnish learners.
 Vocabulary is important to any language, and you will want to memorize as many words as you can in Finnish. A good way to do this is to write up note cards. Put the Finnish word on one side and the English definition on the other. Flip through these every day to improve your memory.


If you do not want to use physical note cards, you can study using a note card app or through an online website.
 Learning to speak Finnish is about more than just memorization. You will have to constantly test yourself to make sure that you can recall important grammatical forms. You can find grammar exercises in a number of places. Do between three and five exercises a day to help you learn the nuances of the language.


Most Finnish textbooks will contain exercises in them.
Websites such as Oneness,Venla,and Tavataan Taasoffer basic online guides and exercises for learners.
You can also look for mobile apps that will help test your Finnish abilities.
 A great way to naturally pick up Finnish is to watch or listen to Finnish media. Thanks to the internet, Finnish television, radio, music, and podcasts are all available to learners, who want to adjust their ears to the sounds of the language. There are a number of websites where you can stream Finnish entertainment. These include:

 Acrylic paint is a good choice but many paints will work, just as long as they have a thicker consistency. Thin paints like watercolors should not be used, since they are not thick enough to adhere glitter.
 Using a paintbrush, add a layer of paint to the area of wood you want to glitter.


If the wooden item is large, it's a good idea to paint it in sections and then apply glitter to each section. This helps to avoid the possibility that the paint dries before you have a chance to add glitter.
Sprinkle the glitter onto the wet paint.
 The glitter will set in place with the paint. You can either leave the project as is or add another coat of paint and glitter.


This method can either add a subtle sparkle, or you can apply a thick layer of glitter for a more striking effect.

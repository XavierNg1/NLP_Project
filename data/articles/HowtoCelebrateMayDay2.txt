 In the Germanic cultures, bonfires were made for May Day and herds of cattle driven between them to rid them from evil spirits and protect them from harm. Fires are still burned on May eve, the night between April 30 and May 1, today.


Naturally, don't start bonfires without first knowing that it's okay according to local regulations. And be sure to properly account for the weather conditions, to avoid the potential for out-of-control burning.

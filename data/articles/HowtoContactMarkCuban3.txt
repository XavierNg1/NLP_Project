 If your attempts to contact Mark Cuban through other means have not offered any success, you can do what many hopeful investors do and audition for Shark Tank. One of the easiest ways to apply for the show is to send an email pitching your idea to the casting team or to submit an online application through the Shark Tank website.


Send your email to: SharkTankCasting@yahoo.com

Apply online with an application and submission video by going to: http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/apply

When you apply through electronically, you need to provide information about yourself, including your name, age, contact information, and a recent photograph.
You also need to include information about your business or product. Pitch the dream, rather than the figures, so that the casting directors can really pick up on your passion. Also include a bit of brief background information about this history of your product or business, as well as an outline of how you plan to make your business thrive.
 While Cuban may not appear at every live casting call, he does show up to some, and you might have a chance to talk to him directly if you go to one. Make sure that you come prepared, though, so that you can leave a good impression on him.

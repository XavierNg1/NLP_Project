 There are support groups for specific disabilities (e.g. cerebral palsy), groups of disabilities (e.g. mental illnesses), or disability in general.


Make sure that you qualify for the group before you go. For example, if the group is only for people who have Down Syndrome, and you are the mother of a child with Down Syndrome, this is not a space for you.;
, From the Special Olympics to a social group to people with ADHD, there are plenty of recreational groups that focus on disability.
 You don't have to limit yourself to in-person friendships; the internet can be a great way to meet people like you.
 Many people with disabilities will show up to disability-related events, either as beneficiaries or as volunteers. Look for a positive, inclusive event tailored towards people with disabilities.


Make sure the event is disability-friendly first! Some disability organizations exploit disabled people instead of helping them. Check with the disabled community to make sure that people with disabilities actually support the event.

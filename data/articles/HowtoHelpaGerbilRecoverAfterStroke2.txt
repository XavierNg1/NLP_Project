 Gerbils who suffer a stroke mostly need care as they recover. The most important thing is to help keep them comfortable. To help with this, provide the gerbil with a warm spot in the corner of their cage. This helps your gerbil feel secure and warm as they rest and recover.Try placing a towel over part of the cage, keeping the room warm, or giving plenty of material in the cage so the gerbil can stay warm.
 Another thing you can do is to give the gerbil some extra material so they can make a warm nest in the cage. You might want to give them a wood nest box or a toilet paper roll to give them a hiding place.The hiding place helps give them a place to go so they can feel secure and safe from perceived predators or stressors.
 Putting your gerbil in a stress-free environment can help speed their recovery. Gerbils can get startled and upset easily if there are too many stressors around them. After a stroke, move your gerbilâ€™s cage to a quiet, low-traffic room to help reduce loud noises that may startle them.You may also consider keeping the room dark or putting a towel over one part of the tank so that the gerbil can go to rest in a dark, quiet area.

 The two bookmarks shown in this article provide two design ideas. The first is to cover the card with lace in its entirety. The second is to use different widths of lace to create a special pattern effect. Play around with the lace that you have prior to gluing, to see what will look most effective.
 Use a fabric/card safe glue and carefully attach your lace. Be sure to make it fit neatly to edges, etc. Trim any excess.
 Once dry, it is ready for use or for gifting.

 You can ask Slackbot a question about any Slack feature by sending it a direct message. Slackbot will respond to your question with an answer—or, at the very least, a link to a page that will give you more information., Your question can be about any Slack feature.


For example, type “How do I upload a file?” to receive a quick walk-through and a link that contains more information.
You could also type a keyword or phrase instead of a question. Typing “upload a file” will yield the same response as “How do I upload a file?”
Slackbot can only answer questions about using Slack.
 If Slack doesn’t understand your question, it will respond with, “I’m afraid I don’t understand, I’m sorry!” Think about other ways to ask the same question, and then try them out.


For example, asking “How do I talk to my coworker privately?” will confuse Slack, but “How do I send a private message?” will yield a direct link to a helpful walkthrough.
 If you’re not able to get a helpful response from Slackbot after rephrasing your question, visit Slack’s help database at http://get.slack.help.
 When you’re done asking questions, click the name of your desired channel in the left menu (desktop version) or tap the down-arrow next to “@Slackbot” and choose “Close DM” (mobile).

 It's pretty self-explanatory. Cover up any computer lights, such as the mouse light, or any other lights.
 Make sure you pick up every thing you can trip over. Also make sure you pick up all laundry baskets; if you kick them, it can hurt badly.
 After you do that, say something like "1 2 3 NOT IT!" or do "Bubble Gum Bubble Gum in a Dish", or something like that to decide who is "it".

 You can give them Kitten Milk Replacer (KMR) or goat milk. Rabbit milk is very high in calories, so it’s important to get a good replacement.Add in one tablespoon of 100% heavy whipping cream without sugar to increase the fat content of the milk.
 Baby bunnies should be fed twice per day.They should be weaned at 6-8 weeks, but will need to be fed exponentially more each week. The following amounts should be a good guideline:


Newborn to 1 week: 4-5 cc formula
1-2 weeks: 10-15 cc formula
2-3 weeks: 15-30 cc formula
3-6 weeks: 30 cc formula

, You can use the syringe to measure the formula quantity and for the baby bunny to suckle carefully on when feeding.


Baby bunnies feed on their backs and should suckle milk from the syringe. Don’t squeeze the syringe, since this can cause the baby bunny to suffocate.
 This will make sure the intestinal tract and urinary system are running smoothly. Use a warm cloth or cotton ball to stimulate your bunny’s genitals until they begin using the bathroom.


The stool should be soft, green, and yellow. If the urine is brown and gritty, rather than yellow, bring the baby to a vet immediately, since they may be severely dehydrated.
 You can bring them hay and pellets, but not yet fruits or vegetables. Put them out for your baby bunny to reach if they are curious and ready.

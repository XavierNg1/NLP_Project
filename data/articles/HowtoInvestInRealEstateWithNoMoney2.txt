 If you are big on ideas but short on cash, bringing in a partner who will provide the funding and allow you to do the managing might be an attractive option. You will need to write up a contract that establishes who is responsible for what, and how the profits will be divided.


If your partner is in place strictly for financial support, make sure you retain all control over the day-to-day management of your investment.
 If you lack carpentry, plumbing and electrical skills to fix up and resell a property, partner with someone who does have these skills and could help with the down payment. Once you make a profit on the sale, you will have the down payment for your next real estate investment.

 Students who have interacted with this teacher before may be able to offer insight into the teacher's personality that could help you better navigate the class. They may also be able to offer coping strategies. Be wary of the advice of students who have a bad reputation with most of their teachers.
Try and find out the types of things the teacher respects in a student.;
, Showing up late can really get on a teacher's nerves. If they have to stop teaching to wait for you to take your seat and settle in they may be tempted to make an example out of you. Try to aim for getting to class at least ten minutes early so you can find a seat and be ready with your notebook or laptop out when class officially begins.
 Some teachers might come out and tell you what some of their pet peeves are, but others you’ll have to be on the lookout for. If you see another student get scolded for something, take note and avoid that behavior if you can. Don’t talk socially with friends during class.
Keep your cellphone on silent and tucked away in your book bag.
Don’t eat food during class.
 Try and find a seat in class that is near the middle but away from students you know tend to act out or do other things that draw the teachers attention. You'll avoid being lumped together with excessive talkers or chronic sleepers if you steer clear of sitting near them altogether.

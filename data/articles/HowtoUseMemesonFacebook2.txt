 Once logged in, you will see your News Feed. Scroll down the feed until you find a post you want to use a meme to comment on. Below posts is a text box with “Write a comment” in it. Click this so a text cursor appears in the box.
 A file explorer will open, which you can use to locate the meme file on your computer.
 Once you find the meme file, double-click on it. It will be uploaded to the comment box.
 Once you’ve uploaded the meme, you can still add a comment if you feel that the meme isn’t enough to relay what you have in mind. Just type it in in the comment box.
 Once you’re ready to share your meme, and comment, just press Enter on your keyboard. It will be posted to the comment threads of the selected post.

 If you are looking to networking with others in person, try going to a meet up in your area that focuses on your industry. Meet ups are a good way to network in a casual, relaxed way with professionals in your industry. Search for meet ups specific to your industry online or chat with other telecommuters you work with to see if they know of any meet ups. There is usually a list of meet ups by area on Meetup.com.For example, if you are a copy writer who telecommutes, you may look for a copy writing meet up in your area. This will allow you to network with others in your industry in person.
 Depending on where you live, you may also be able to find local networking events that you can attend. Networking events are often put on by local business associations or leaders in the industry. They may notify individuals in the industry by email or social media about networking events that might interest them.


For example, you may attend a networking lunch event for copy writers in your area so you can meet others and build your clientele. Or you may attend a networking brunch in your area for small business owners to get to know others in the area and to promote your business.
 To make your networking more field specific, check to see if there is a professional business association you can join that connects to your field or industry. Often, professional business associations will have a strong online presence and can work as a networking tool. They also give you the opportunity to meet peers or people in your industry face to face at networking events put on through the professional business association.For example, if you are a computer programmer, you may look for a professional business association in your area for computer programmers.

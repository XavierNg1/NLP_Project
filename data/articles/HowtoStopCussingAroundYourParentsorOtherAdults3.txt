 People tend to have more success at accomplishing goals when they have a buddy.If you have a friend or sibling who has the same problem as you, then ask if he or she would like to team up with you. You can help keep each other accountable and encourage each other when you do well.
 If you are really serious about stopping, put 50 cents or a dollar into a jar every time you swear in front of an adult or parent. Commit to giving that money away to a friend or sibling. This will negatively affect your wallet. It is an effective way of punishing yourself to stop swearing.If you lack willpower and will end up cheating and spending the money yourself, give control over the jar to a friend, sibling, or even a parent.
As the jar fills up, think of all the junk food, games, and other awesome stuff you could have bought with the money.
 Each time you swear in front of a parent or adult, pull it back and give yourself a hard snap. Doing this will teach you to associate cussing with stinging pain, which should make it easier to stop. Also consider asking a friend or sibling to snap the elastic if you cuss. Just remember that you asked them to do it!Donâ€™t wear an elastic band that is so tight it will cut off circulation.
Avoid a super thick elastic that could break the skin.

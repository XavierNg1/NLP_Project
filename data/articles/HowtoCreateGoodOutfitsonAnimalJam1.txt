 Choose a favorite clothing item of yours and put it on your animal.;
, The clothing items could be the same color or theme. So, if you had a blue and orange Bow and Arrows, wear something like a dark blue Fox Hat or a blue Scarf from Jam Mart. Remember that you don't need to look for things that are Rare; if you like the item, wear it!


If you need a certain color of an item that is in Jam Mart or another store, ask a member if they can change the color for you.
 Try out different patterns as a way to add extra colors, as they don't overwhelm the look but add a hint of that color.

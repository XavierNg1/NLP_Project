 There is a large range of bowel movement frequency for children. The average number of bowel movements for infants is two to four stools a day. For toddlers, the average is one to two stools a day.


If your child generally has fewer bowel movements but does not have any discomfort or difficulty, that is likely normal for her.Even just three to four stools a week can be normal for some children.
 Child constipation causes a variety of symptoms. If your child exhibits at least two of the following conditions, he may have functional constipation. These symptoms includeThree or less bowel movements per week
A loss of control of bowel movement at least one time per week after she learns to use the toilet
Abdominal pain
Nausea
A history of holding in stool
Painful, dry, or difficult bowel movements
The presence of a large stool in the rectum, which leave behind liquid or clay-like stools in the underwear
Large stools that may block the toilet

, If home remedies haven't worked within five to seven days, talk to your child's pediatrician about additional options.

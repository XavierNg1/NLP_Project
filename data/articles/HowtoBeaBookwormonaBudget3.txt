 If you are having trouble finding a specific work, try searching online for the author's email or snail mail address. Many authors are delighted to hear from readers, and may send you a free or discount copy. This is especially true for lesser-known authors, or authors with specialized audiences.
 Some publishers offer discounts or review copies to people in exchange for a review. Your best bet is to start a blog or similar platform that allows you to reach a moderately large audience.
 If you spend all your free time in bookstores, get to know the people behind the counter. You may get freebies and discounts, or just the privilege of reading in the store without a purchase.


You may even be able to work part-time to earn a sizable employee's discount.
 Volunteer to help relatives or neighbors clean out their storage spaces in exchange for unwanted books.
 If the writing bug catches you, you'll be spending many hours with the written word! For motivation and even more reading material, challenge your friends to writing projects and share your works with each other.

 Call your neighbors and ask if their children would like to come over to play in the snow. Ask everyone to make a stash of snowballs to prepare for a snowball fight. Your child will have a lot of fun playing with other kids in the neighborhood, and this active game it will help them burn off some energy.
 Show your child how to create artwork by using the snow as their canvas. Keep a few empty spray bottles on hand and fill them with water and a few drops of food coloring. Let your kids express their creativity in a new, exciting way by covering the snow with color. Theyâ€™ll have fun creating pictures, writing their name, or just scribbling with blue, purple, or green sprays onto the bright white snow., If you have some hills in your yard or your neighborhood, grab a sled and zoom down the hill with your child. If you have younger children, sit on the sled with them as they go down. Your child will feel like they are on a winter rollercoaster.
 Let your child take care of the animals during their snow day by feeding the birds. Hollow out an orange by carefully slicing off the top with a knife and scooping out the pulp with a spoon. Once it has been hollowed out, pierce the skin with two sticks and push them all the way through to create four quadrants. Tie some string from each of the sticks, and secure it to a tree branch. Have your little one fill the orange with birdseed.Consider placing the birdfeeder near a window where you and your child can watch the birds enjoy a snack.
 Grab a bottle of bubbles and take them outside when the temperatures are below freezing. When your child blows the bubbles, they should immediately freeze on the wand.

 You'll need an eyelash curler, mascara, eyeliner, and false eyelashes with eyelash glue.
 Open your curler and hold it close to your eye along your upper eyelid. Blink gently to swing your eyelashes into the open device. Carefully close the curler, stopping immediately if you feel any pulling or discomfort. Repeat a few times for a more dramatic effect.









When you're done, switch to your other eye to repeat the process.
 Measure your false eyelash against your eye and cut it to the right length. Place a fine line of lash glue on the back of your hand and run the base of your false eyelash along it. Press the falsie gently along the line of your upper eyelid. Hold it still while it dries.









Do the same for your other eye.
 Wiggle your wand back and forth a bit while pulling it upward along the lashes to fan them out and get more makeup for your stroke.
 Carefully apply some eyeliner along your upper lids to help blend your false eyelashes in with the rest of your look.

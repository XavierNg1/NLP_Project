 The friend group is a strong barometer. They will often have a quick and strong reaction as to whether they are supporting this match or dismissing it.Be friendly with his friends. Find genuine interest in who they are and they will likely return that interest in you.


Spend some time just chatting with his friends without him around.
Ask them specific questions about their lives. Talk more about them than about yourself.
If they invite you to do something, give it a shot, even if itâ€™s new to you. Accept an invitation into the fold.;
, Allow him to see your best talents in action. Impress him by inviting him to see what you are really good at.


If you have an artistic talent, invite him to see you play music or see your art in a gallery. He will see how others are impressed with you and feel like being with you makes him special.
If you have a great sense of fashion, make plans to attend an event where you can dress up. He will see how you stand out ahead of the rest, and feel proud to be arm-in-arm.
 This is different than "playing hard to get." Let him know that you have very discerning taste. You have a lot of interest from others and people available to you, but you don't like just anyone. You have chosen him.

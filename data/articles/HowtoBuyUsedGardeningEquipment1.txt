Check the classified sections of your local newspapers; especially the Sunday edition in which many people will have their ads for used gardening equipment posted.
Visit the websites for eBay Classifieds and Craigslist to find more ads posted by people in your local area. The "farm and garden" section will most likely feature used gardening tools and equipment for sale.;

Review the classified ads in newspapers and online to determine the dates, times, and locations of the yard sales or estate sales. In some cases, there may be entire neighborhoods or blocks that are hosting a series of garage sales all on the same day.
Go directly to the garage, shed, or backyard areas of estate sales, which is where used gardening equipment will most likely be stored.
 Flea markets, independent thrift stores or thrift store chains that donate their earnings to charities such as Goodwill or the Salvation Army will usually carry a variety of used gardening tools and supplies.
 EBay will allow you to browse and buy used gardening equipment in an auction-style format or with a buy-it-now option.


Read and review the eBay listings in their entirety before bidding on or purchasing any used gardening equipment; as some items may be sold "as is" and cannot be returned.
Review the ratings and feedback of the seller before making any purchases on eBay. This will allow you to verify whether the seller is reliable and has a positive reputation.
Ask the seller questions about an item if the listing is incomplete or does not provide you with the information you need. This will help you with determining if the item is worth purchasing.

 Wrap one half in plastic food wrap and put the other half into a small bowl.;
, Mix into the marzipan with your fingers. Add another drop and see how the color improves. Add more drops if needed; judge this as you go.,, Squash the ball between your thumb and forefinger to form a mushroom shape. Push your thumb right up and under the ball to create a hollow. Repeat for the remaining 7 pieces.
 This will ensure that you don't transfer any red coloring to the white. Unwrap the half of the marzipan you earlier set aside. Turn this into spots: break off a third of the marzipan, then roll it into many little balls of varying sizes.
 Break the remaining piece of marzipan into 8 pieces, to create the stalks.
 Gently press a spotted toadstool top onto the top of each stalk.
 The toadstools can be eaten like candy if you like marzipan, added to a cake top, used in sugar craft designs, etc.

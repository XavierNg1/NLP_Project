 It’s important to request the refund within a timely manner. For packages that have been shipped by Priority Mail (or Priority Mail International), Global Express, or Click-N-Ship labels, the USPS will offer a full refund if the package is delivered late. However, you must make the request within 30 days from the date of purchase for a domestic purchase (or domestically shipped package) or 90 days from the date of purchase for an international purchase (or internationally shipped item).If you procrastinate your request and 30 (or 90) days pass, the postal service will no longer honor your request for a refund., Before you make your case for a refund to the Post Office, you need to have material (typically emails) indicating when you placed your order, when the retail company (or individual) shipped the package, and when the package was supposed to have arrived by.Without these materials, the USPS will be unwilling to provide a refund. You’ll need:


The package tracking number.
A “proof of purchase,” such as your receipt from an online retailer.
 USPS refund requests cannot be made online or over the phone; you must request a refund in person at a USPS office.Bring the previously mentioned materials, and ask to speak to the Post-Office supervisor to help you file your claim. At the Post Office, you’ll be asked to fill out and turn in a PS Form 3533, to process the refund request.Do not use any versions of the PS Form 3533 that are available online (as a PDF, for example). Each copy of the form has a unique barcode, so you must obtain a new paper-copy form from the USPS office.
 It may take some time for the USPS to look into the delay on your package and issue a refund. When the refund does come, it will be as a cash payment or via money order.If the amount refunded is different than what you expected (or what you paid for shipping initially), contact the USPS office and ask for the oversight to be fixed.

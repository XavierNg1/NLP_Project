 Mostly black, but add the occasional color to the walls. So, maybe if you had three black walls, you could jazz it up with one vibrant, neon, bright red, yellow, pink or blue. NOTE: stay away from horrible colors like mustard or bogey green unless you REALLY have to.;
, To be honest, the color of your carpet doesn't really matter, but to give your room that extra spark, make your carpet a bright color, maybe the same color as your neon wall. Or you could just stick to plain black.
 As long as your furniture isn't covered in stickers you used when you were five, you'll be fine. Wooden furniture goes with everything but then again, so does black. Try maybe to get like a black wardrobe with brightly colored handles.
 If you look at any emo or scene person's room, their gonna have millions of posters covering the walls, even if it's their favorite cartoon characters. Find posters of your favorite bands, TV programs, Movies, Idols and Role Models.
 So, you've got colors and posters. All you need now is some funky beanbags and cushions to spice up your room. Get brightly colored bed covers, cushions with a weird pattern on them and some beanbags flung in the corner.
 Every emo room should have a music corner. This should be where you keep your iPod and docking station and the many hundreds of CDs you've collected over the years. Only buy your CDs. Never download them illegally off the internet.

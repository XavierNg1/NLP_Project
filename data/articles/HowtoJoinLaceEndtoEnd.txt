 This will make the lace appear as if it is running on and on without a break, which is ideal for items such as bags and stuffed toys. It won't always be possible but it's the first preference.;
, The most common method for joining lace end to end is to overlap the ends and then over-sew the edges.


Turn the cut ends of the lace under if they're more than an inch (2.5cm) wide, before sewing.
 Where the lace is wider (2.5" to 6" / 6-15cm), cut around the lace pattern with care on both ends of the lace and stitch together using stick-on adhesive to keep in place, as is done with wedding lace motifs. That way you can be sure it won't shift during sewing and the join will be perfect.

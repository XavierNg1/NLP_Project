, The kids can draw any background they want their Webkinz (or LilKinz) to be in!

, Act out various scenes with the Webkinz pets. It doesn't matter where they get it from.
 Or they can take pictures of their Webkinz, and you can upload them to the computer, go to Windows Movie Maker, and make the pictures into a movie and put it on a DVD+R disc. Makes a great Christmas gift or entertainment option!

, Or you can put on the radio and do it the same way.
 The kids can ask the Webkinz various questions, such as how they like living in Webkinz World, how they spend their spare time, or their own ideas!

, Keeps the kids busy for hours!

,, Draw Webkinz on pieces of paper, and take them places. For example, one corner of the room can be the Adoption Center, and the other corner can be the Arcade.
 Make up their own games to play on the island.
, Give them a "math assignment" to do, and check over their answers. Or you can have them study for a big test coming up.
,, They will listen when no one else will.

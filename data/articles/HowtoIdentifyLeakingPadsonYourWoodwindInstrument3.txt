 You want to use paper that’s as thin as possible, so tobacco rolling paper works well. When you’re cutting the paper, the strip should be very narrow, approximately ¼-inch wide. It’s a good idea to taper the strip, though, so you’ll have a thicker portion that’s easier to grip with your fingers. You don’t need to make it too long -- 3 to 4 inches is sufficient.If you don’t have tobacco paper on hand, tissue paper, cellophane wrappers from food or other products, or store receipts are effective alternatives.
If you want to make it even easier to grab the paper, attach a thin stick, such as a chopstick, to the end of the paper to create a handle., Make sure that you set the thinner end of the strip over the tone hole, and gently close the pad over it. The paper should be sandwiched between the pad and tone hole, but the wide edge should hang over the edge so you can grip it with your fingers., Grasp the wide end of the strip, and carefully tug on it. As you pull, pay attention to the amount of drag or resistance that you feel. If you can pull the paper out easily, you’ve identified the leak.You should repeat this process at four different spots around the pad to check for a leak all the way around.

 The sheet should be large enough to hold all of your completed spice tins, and if you plan on expanding your collection of spices, you may want to get a sheet that can fit a few extra tins.

A sheet of stainless steel is, in theory, the best option, but stainless steel sheets can be expensive. An aluminum sheet will be more cost effective.
 The downside of aluminum is that it can rust inside of a moisture-filled room like the kitchen. Purchase a sealing spray or an anti-rust spray from a home improvement store to prevent the sheet from getting damaged. Follow the directions on the product's label to coat the entire metal sheet.

Note that if you opted for a stainless steel sheet, this step is not necessary.
 The advantage of using Velcro is that it does not damage the wall and can be removed more easily if something goes wrong. The wider the strips, the better, since wider strips will have more holding power than narrow ones. Attach the Velcro strips along the entire length of the top and bottom, fixing them in place with super glue or a similarly strong adhesive., Use a ruler or tape measure to make sure that the Velcro strips are spaced the exact same distance apart from one another as they are on the back of the metal sheet, so that the connecting strips line up. Do not attach the Velcro to the wall using super glue, since using such a strong adhesive defeats the point of having a removable hanging device. Instead, use heavy-duty craft glue that is strong but can be removed with a solution or powerful force.

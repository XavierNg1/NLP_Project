 There are many tools available that can do network scanning. One good tool is inSSIDer.

, Choose between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels.


Most newer models of Cisco Wi-Fi routers support 5 GHz. This frequency has less traffic compared to 2.4 GHz since less devices are able to broadcast through it. If your router has this, use it. Otherwise, you’re left with 2.4 GHz.
 Sort the networks by channel and scan the results. Select the channel with the least number of networks. This is the optimal channel that has the fewest number of users or routers broadcasting through it.
 To do this, go to the Cisco router’s configuration page. The default IP address for Cisco routers is 192.168.1.1.


Note that this may have been changed during your router setup, so make sure to use the correct one.
 Use your admin username and password to log into the configuration page. Other user types may not have the needed access to make the changes need.
 From the top menu bar, click on “Wireless” to access the Wireless Settings page.
 You should see two sets of wireless settings here, one for 2.4 GHz and one for 5 GHz. Review the settings here to make sure everything is still correct.


You will want to focus on the settings for 5 GHz if that’s the one you’re using. This is the one on top.
 Look at all the settings available and choose the settings for "Channel." Select the optimal channel you got from the scan results.
 Click on the “Save Settings” button on the bottom part of the page to save the changes you’ve made.


You have now successfully optimized your Cisco Wi-Fi router’s channel.

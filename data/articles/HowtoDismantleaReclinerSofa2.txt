 Lift the sofa onto its front side so its back faces straight up toward the ceiling. Look under the sofa to see if it has base bars. If they’re present, you should see two or three bars screwed or bolted from one end of the sofa’s base to the other., Check the heads of the screws or bolts that secure the base bars. Use a drill with the appropriate bit to unfasten each screw or bolt from the base bars.You’ll probably need Robertson drive bits, as base bars are often secured with square Robertson screws.
 It’s best to get someone to help you remove a sofa’s base bars, especially when removing the final bar. When you detach the last bar, the individual seats and console will come apart freely. Having someone stabilize the sofa will help keep its components from rolling away, getting damaged, or damaging nearby objects.

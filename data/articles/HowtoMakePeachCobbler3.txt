 Some people find it easier to cut the peaches into quarters before peeling them. Cut each peach into 10 slices., You can do this using a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula., You can use any type of pan or skillet, but something that is made from cast-iron would be best. Be sure to stir the peaches from time to time so that they don't burn. While the peaches are cooking, you can start preparing the biscuit topping., Keep stirring until everything is evenly combined. For a more flavorful cobbler, add ½ teaspoon of ground cinnamon and ½ teaspoon of ground cardamom., If you have not already done so, cut the butter into small cubes first, then add it to the flour mixture. Use your fingers, a pastry blender, a food processor, or two knives to cut the butter into the flour mixture. Keep cutting the butter until the mixture becomes coarse, with pea-sized crumbs., Do not over-stir the dough. It will be wet, and there will be some clumps of flour.If you over-mix the dough, it may not rise properly., Lightly dust your work surface with flour, then turn the dough onto it. Use your hands to pat it into a flat disk, about ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick. Next, use a drinking glass or a 2½-inch (6.35-centimeter) biscuit cutter to cut out 8 to 12 biscuits., Try to arrange them as best as you can in your pan. If you cannot fit all of the biscuits, don't try to cram them. Instead, bake them in the oven at 425°F (220°C) for about 12 minutes, and serve them alongside the cobbler., The cobbler is ready when the biscuits have puffed up and cooked through.


If you want a more crust-like topping, stick the cobbler under the broiler in your oven for a few minutes. Only do this if your skillet is oven-safe, however., You can serve it as it is, or you can garnish it with some ice cream or whipped cream.

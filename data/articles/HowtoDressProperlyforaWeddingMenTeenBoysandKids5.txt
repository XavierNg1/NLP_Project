 These days people do wear a black tie but a bow-tie is better. You cannot wear anything less than a tuxedo. If you don't have one, rent one.
 This is black tie, except you can change the color of your tuxedo, tie, etc. if you want to. So that means it doesn't have to be black and white.


If you are invited to a white tie wedding, congratulations! White tie consists of a black tailcoat jacket, full white waistcoat, wing-tipped collared dress shirt, self-tied white bow tie, and patent leather dress shoes. This is your only choice. You cannot wear anything else.

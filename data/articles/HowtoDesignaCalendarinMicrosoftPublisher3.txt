 Both of these buttons are found in the Objects toolbar. The Word Art button displays a pair of capital A's leaning to the right, while the Text Box button resembles a newspaper page, with a capital "A" in the upper left.


Use the Word Art option for short, decorative text. Word Art offers the option to shape the text layout as well as change the font, size and color or bold and italicize.
Use the Text Box option for longer text. You can change the font, size and color or bold and italicize, but you can't change the shape and layout as you can with Word Art. You can, however, change the color of the box the text appears in.
 The order in which you do these two steps depends on whether you're inserting Word Art or text in a text box.


If you're inserting Word Art, select one of the style options from the Word Art Gallery, then select your font options and enter your text. When you click "OK," your text will appear surrounded by sizing handle dots. You can move this text to the place you want by placing your cursor over the text so that your cursor pointer becomes a four-headed arrow. Use your mouse to drag the Word Art text where you want it.
If you're inserting a text box, move your cursor to where you want to put the text box, then drag your mouse button to create the text box in the size you want. (The box will appear surrounded by sizing handles when you release the cursor, allowing you to re-size the text box if necessary.) Type your text at the cursor.
 Once you've placed your text as Word Art or in a text box, you can modify its appearance as you wish by first clicking on it and following the instructions below.


To modify the appearance of Word Art, use one of the options in the floating Word Art toolbar to change the color, shape or formatting ï¿½ or to choose a new option from the Word Art Gallery.
To change the appearance of text in a text box, click on the box with your right mouse button to display a floating menu. Choose an option in the Change Text sub-menu to alter the text's appearance, such as Font to change the font and point size. Select Format Text Box to change the text box's appearance, such as adding a fill color to the box or a border. To change the text itself, click on it to highlight it and type the new text, or place your cursor at a point in the text to insert or delete individual text characters.
You can make changes to either Word Art or text box text, but you cannot directly change one into the other. You can, however, select the text from a text box or Text field in the Edit Word Art Text dialog, copy it to the Clipboard by pressing Ctrl-C on your keyboard and then paste it into the other place by pressing Ctrl-V.

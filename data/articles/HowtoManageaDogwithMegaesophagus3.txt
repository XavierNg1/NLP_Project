 Megaesophagus may happen for two reasons: firstly, damage to the muscular wall of the esophagus means a ring of scar tissue forms, and secondly, because of an anatomical quirk called a "vascular ring anomaly".


The latter is caused by the retention of a blood vessel present in the fetus, which should break up before birth. The location of the blood vessel (the right aortic arch) completes a band around the esophagus, equivalent to placing a tight rubber band around a tubular structure.
 This is a passive process, which means there is no muscular involvementâ€”when the dog's head lowers food simply slides back towards the mouth under gravity. This is one of the main symptoms of this condition.Characteristic of regurgitation is that there are no "heaving" efforts involved, such as when a dog is sick. Likewise the food that reappears tends to be a sausage shape, reflecting the size and shape of the pocket in the esophagus.
Because the food hasn't got as far as the stomach it consists of chewed food mixed with saliva and is not digested at all.
 Dogs with megaesophagus have difficulty swallowing and make repeated attempts to do so. Another sign is a dog with a good appetite who is either underweight, or has difficulty keeping weight on. This is because he loses calories when he regurgitates, so despite eating well he is not benefiting from the food.

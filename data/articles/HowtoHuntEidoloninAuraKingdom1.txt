 After creating your new character in Aura Kingdom, you will be able choose 1 of the 4 starter Eidolons that will eventually unlock when you reach level 10. You can choose Serif, Merrilee, Grimm, or Alessa.


Serif is a sprightly lightning-element warrior. He possesses high defense and can damage a single target. This is a very good starter Eidolon for players who need a tank to protect them.
Merrilee is an ice-element sylph. She uses magic and is a range-support type. Most Wizards and Sorcerers go for Merrilee because of her ability to cast a magical shield that regenerates the health of party members.
Grimm is a fire-type Eidolon and quite favorable in Infernal Abyss since the monsters in this dungeon are weak against fire elements. Grimm is mostly partnered with tanks such as Guardians and Berserkers because of his devastating damage and AoE skills.
Alessa is a young unicorn and a master of the element of light. This Eidolon has a high evasion rate and possesses skills for both single and AoE. She's also equipped with a skill that can damage an enemy continuously.;
, When you reach level 25, the quest “Call of Gaia” will be available for you. Your reward will be the Eidolon Sigrun. Sigrun, a Valkyrie, is a mighty warrior-maiden who combs battlefields for the souls of the fallen. She is an ice-property Eidolon with high attack power and defense.


Most players use Sigrun during dungeon raids because of her ability to take on multiple opponents.
Sigrun is also a good tank for players who frequently do solo raids.
 As you reach level 40, another Eidolon quest, “Resonance of Gaia,” will be available for you to complete and will reward you with Gigas.


Gigas is an Iron Titan who wields lightning. He holds high single-target damage and defense, with skills that can stun mage enemies and decreases their attack speed and accuracy.
This is the last Eidolon you can acquire through quests.

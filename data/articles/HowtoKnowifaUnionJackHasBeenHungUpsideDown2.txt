 When drawing the flag or putting up a graphic of the flag with no pole, assume the pole is on the left side of the flag. This means that the thick white stripes should lay over the red stripes on the left side of the flag.
 When draping the flag over a coffin for a funeral service, make sure that the top left of the Union Jack be laid over the top left corner of the coffin. This is the traditional way to drape the flag for military funerals.


Before cremating or burying the body, the flag should be removed and folded.It is improper to use the flag as drapage for seat covers or tablecloths, or as a cover for boxes, barriers, or art during an unveiling ceremony., If your patch of the flag is on the left shoulder, you should wear the flag as it would normally look. However, on the right shoulder, the flag should be flipped backwards.


This is similar to American Military Uniforms which require the flag to be reverse.

 Remember, "keyword" refers to a group of words that describe a product or service you want users to find.
 Around the advent of the World Wide Web, companies shot up the search results by stuffing each page with keywords. Now, companies like Google steer clear of pages obviously designed to appeal to their search engines. Insert your keyword once every paragraph or so.


A good way to judge keyword density is to use a keyword in writing as often as you'd use it in conversation with a friend. You wouldn't mention a specific product name every five words in normal conversation, so don't do it in your writing.
 A good way to insert keywords without tripping the keyword-density alarms used by search engines is to switch up the way you use your keyword. Use singular and plural forms, synonyms, and general terms.
 Attaching links to other pages on your site to mentions of keywords is a great way to drive page views. The second or third time you mention the keyword, attach a link to it that takes visitors to a relevant page on your site.

The 3 angles inside a triangle will always have a sum of 180 degrees.
,


Name the triangle as an obtuse triangle if any of the angles are greater than 90 degrees. An obtuse triangle will only have 1 obtuse angle.
Classify the triangle as a right triangle if the triangle possess a right angle of 90 degrees. A right triangle will only have 1 right angle.
Categorize the triangle as acute if all 3 of its angles are less than 90 degrees.
Determine that the triangle is equilateral if all 3 of its angles, (which would have to be acute), are congruent. In an equilateral triangle, all 3 of the angles will be 60 degrees, because the sum of the 3 interior angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.

 On your computer go to "Apple"-"System Preferences"-"Sharing. Click the "Bluetooth Sharing" box. Click "Folder for accepted items", then click "other". Create a new folder where you want your pictures to go. Make sure to click and select to turn on "Bluetooth Sharing" service, or else you will get an error/failed to transfer message at the end.;
, Deselect all photos you would like to upload.
 Select the photos you want, then press "Done". Press the little icon in the upper left corner. Press "Search". Your computer's name should pop up onto the screen. Mine says "Alyssa's MacBook Pro". Click on that name.
 Sometimes you have to press it twice for it to work. Select "accept all" and then "accept".

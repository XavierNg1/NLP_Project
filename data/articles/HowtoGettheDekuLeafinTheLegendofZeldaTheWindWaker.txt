 Forest Haven is a location that you find early on in Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and is located at F-6 on your World Map. This is where you will find the Deku Tree.;
, As you approach the Deku Tree, you'll notice a bunch of Chuchus will appear on it. To help the Deku Tree (and therefore earn the Deku Leaf), you'll need to get rid of these Chuchus.


You can get the Chuchus off of the Deku Tree by using a roll attack aimed at the tree trunk.
To use a rolling attack, run at the tree and as you're running press the "A" button on your controller to perform a roll.
The roll attack will knock the Chuchus off of the tree.
Once the Chuchus are off of the Deku Tree, you can then use your sword to attack and kill them.
If there are any more Chuchus after the tree when you have killed all the ones you knocked off, then just repeat the process to get rid of the rest of them.
 To the left of the tree you'll notice that there is a purple flower bud. This is called a baba bud and it will launch you up into the air when you jump on it.


If you don't touch the D-pad when you're in the air, the baba buds will launch you straight up and then you'll fall straight back down, landing on the bud again.
You can use this to your advantage so that you can see where you're going.
You'll need to jump from bud to bud in order to climb all the way to the top of the Deku Tree.
 When you reach the top of the Deku Tree, you should see the Deku Leaf. Simply walk up to it to collect it.

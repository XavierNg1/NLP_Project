 You can make tassels out of just about anything, but this method works best with stringy materials, such as yarn or embroidery floss. You can also use other types of string, such as twine, cording, or very thin rope.;
, The longer your cardboard is, the longer your tassel will be. For a standard tassel, start with a 4 inch (10.16 centimeters) piece of cardboard.You can always trim the tassel shorter when you are done if it is too long for you.
 This will make the string your tassel hangs from. You can use the same color as the rest of your tassel, or a contrasting color. The string should be at least 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) long.Remember, you can always cut it shorter at the end, if you need to.


Consider braiding three strings together first, and then taping them to the cardboard. This will not only make the handing string stronger, but also prettier., Make sure you are wrapping across/over the string you taped to the top of your cardboard. The more you wrap, the fuller your tassel will be. Plan on wrapping it at least 24 times., Don't cut it any higher, of your tassel will be uneven.
 This will help hold your tassel together.
 Your tassel is almost ready. Don't worry if a few strings fall out.
 You can match the color to your tassel, or use a contrasting color.
 Make the knot as tight as you can without breaking the string.
 Try to stay as close to the knot as possible.
 If you are worried about the knot coming loose, you can secure it with a drop of super glue.
 Your tassel may not be even along the bottom. If this happens to you, take a sharp part of scissors, and trim the tassel across the bottom until it is even.

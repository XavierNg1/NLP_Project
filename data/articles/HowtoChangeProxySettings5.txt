 From the menu that appears, hover your cursor over Settings and then select Preferences.
 Click the “Proxy Servers” button. This will open the Proxy configuration window.
 Check the boxes for the protocols that you want the proxy to affect. Most users should check HTTP and HTTPS. Alternatively, you can check the “Use this proxy for all protocols” box.
 In the “Proxy server” field, enter in the IP address or domain of the proxy you are connecting to. Enter the port into the “Port” field. Press OK when you are finished. You may need to restart Opera for the changes to take effect.


If you want to revert to your direct connection, open the Proxy configuration window again and elect “Use automatic proxy configuration”.

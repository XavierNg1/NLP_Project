 You will probably need to take some variation of the listed subjects in freshman year. If you can handle a larger work load, you may be put into Honors or Pre-AP classes.


Mathematics - Most Freshmen will take Algebra 1; however, if you took Algebra in 8th grade, you will take either Geometry or Algebra 2. This is a required class.
Science - Freshmen take Earth Science most of the time. Depending on where you live, that will determine what science you take. Science gets more specific as you go along. This is a required class.
English - As you go further into English, you will begin to focus more on literature and not so much grammar and spelling. This is a required class.
Languages - Most high schools offer Latin, German, French, Spanish, and Sign Language.
Gym - Gym is still required in most states for Freshmen and Sophomore year, but after that it can be taken by choice.
Computers/Technology - While this class is not always required, it is one of the most useful classes you can take in High School.
Electives - There are many different electives you can take in High School. You should pick them based on interest and what will help you later in life. Choose your electives very carefully. They're a lot of fun! If you can take tag, go for it. Don't be tempted to take classes just because they're easy-sounding. Take classes that sound interesting and you'll have a better time, even if they're difficult.;
, Every single grade after you gets to pick first! No worries, you'll get your electives at some point.

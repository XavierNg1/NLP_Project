 Lemon trees are evergreen trees that do not demonstrate a true dormancy, such as the loss of leaves. However, the growth and metabolism of the trees slow down after the fruit harvest. Lemon trees in cooler climates show slower activity just before the rapid spring growth. Pruning should occur during this period of dormancy or right when the new spring growth appears.;
,,,, Lemon trees are made by grafting normal-sized fruit-bearing branches on smaller tree stock (for dwarf trees) or more hardy stock. Suckers are shoots from the rootstock that will reduce fruit yield and adversely affect the health of the lemon tree. They often surpass the height of the main plant in a couple of months if left unchecked, "sucking" the nutrients from the bearing part of the tree.


Suckers that are green and newly formed can be gently broken off at the base.
Suckers with woody stems should be cut with pruning shears flush with the trunk of the lemon tree.
 This will also depend on the type of lemon tree that you have. A small potted lemon tree may produce better with and open look, whereas some people may want a bushier plant.


Traditional lemon pruning results in a tree that is bigger at the bottom than the top. This allows for equal sunlight to all parts of the tree.
 If the tree has more branches on one side, remove some on the heavier side until the tree balances out.
,,, This will force the branches to grow thicker and sturdier. Over the next several growing seasons, concentrate on the main branches that you have chosen, cut them back as needed, and allow secondary branches to grow out from them. Cut back anything that is not strong or that blocks the light from entering the tree.
 Trees should not be allowed to bear fruit until they are mature, which is between 3 and 4 years old.

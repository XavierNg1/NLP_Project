 For example, if you want to give Charizard's arms to Squirtle, you'll want to erase Squirtle's existing arms.
 If you plan to use the part more than once on the base Pokémon, you may instead want to copy the part.


You may want to flip or rotate the part to make it better fit onto the base Pokémon before attaching it, such as if you want to use Feraligatr's head spikes as chin or belly spikes for a sprite made from Voltorb's body.
In some cases, you may want to erase away the body of the donor Pokémon, leaving only the part you want to attach to your sprite. For example, Voltorb and Gastly are both ball-shaped, so if you want to put Gasly's aura on Voltorb, you can erase Gasly's body, leaving only its aura.
 In most cases, you'll drag the donated part to the base Pokémon. In other cases, you may find it looks better to drag the base Pokémon to the new part. Experiment to see which way works best.
 In some cases, you may want to capture additional Pokémon images if you suddenly realize one of them has appendages your sprite should have.
 You can use the existing colors from the base Pokémon, its appendages, or any of the colors available in the paint palettes of your graphic editor program.


One coloring technique you can use is to set up your erase feature to erase in the color you want to paint the sprite and use it instead of one of the brush settings.
 Give the sprite a name that suggests its appearance or capabilities. This is how most Pokémon are named.

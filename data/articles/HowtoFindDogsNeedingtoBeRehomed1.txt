 Check your local newspaper’s personal ads both online and in print for notices that indicate a pet needs rehoming. These could include ads from people moving and looking to rehome a pet or notices about puppies for adoption after someone’s pet gave birth.Look both in “Pet” and “For Sale” categories if your newspaper breaks up ads by types.;
, Look online at websites such as Craigslist and local pet care or pet adoption forums to see if anyone in your area is looking to rehome a dog. You can also place “Wanted” ads in these communities stating that you are looking for a dog to rehome.Adoption websites often offer rehoming forums and community message boards to help owners find a new home for their dogs without having to put them in a shelter.
Be cautious about unscrupulous breeders trying to sell people puppies by offering them for “adoption” but attaching unreasonable rehoming fees in excess of $500.
 Check areas such as community centers, recreation center, local dog parks, coffee shops, campus bulletin boards, and other areas where community information is posted to look for flyers indicating a pet needs to be rehomed. Check different places to see different dogs.These boards are often cleaned and changed out regularly, generally about once a month. Check back regularly to see if any new flyers show up offering a dog to a good home.
Remember to have something handy when looking at flyers to record contact information such as phone number or email address.

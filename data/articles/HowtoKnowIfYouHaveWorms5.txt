 This condition is called tenesmus. Your bodyâ€™s immune system fights off an invading organism like worms, it can cause your digestive tract to become inflamed The inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract makes it harder for you to pass your stool normally, which can lead to tenesmus, or the feeling that you need to pass stools, even when your bowels are empty.This can cause:


Straining.
Pain in the rectum.
Cramping.
 Whipworms can obstruct or do damage to your intestinal wall and intestinal lumens (the passages through your intestines).When your intestines get blocked, you can develop:


Abdominal cramping.
Nausea.
Vomiting.
 Whipworms tend to bury their heads into the intestinal wall. This can lead to increase fluid secretion and/or decreased fluid absorption in your colon. When your colon starts increasing fluid secretion, your body has a hard time reabsorbed the fluid, which can lead to:


Diarrhea.
Dehydration or the feeling that you are always thirsty.
Loss of electrolytes and nutrients.
 In a whipworm infection, the rectum loses its internal support because the worms bury their thin heads into the intestinal lining. This can cause the muscles surrounding your intestine to weaken, which in turn can lead to rectal prolapse.This condition is when:


The lower portion of your colon, which is located just inside the anal canal, turns inside out and can come a little ways out of your body.

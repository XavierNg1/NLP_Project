 The dungeon finder is a tool that can help you find a group to complete a dungeon with. You can queue alone in the Dungeon Finder, and it will automatically match you with 4 other players then send you to a dungeon. To open the Dungeon Finder, press “I” on your keyboard or click on the Dungeon Finder icon on your menu bar. Once you have opened the Dungeon Finder, select the Damage Dealer role then click on the “Find Group” button.

Once the dungeon finder matches you with a group, a notification will pop up on your screen with a button that says “Enter Dungeon.” Click on the “Enter Dungeon” button and you will be teleported to the dungeon.
If you are leveling a Warlock, you can only fulfill the Damage Dealer role. Warlocks cannot be healers or tanks.
Dungeons contain enemies that are more powerful than you would find out in the open world.
By definition, a dungeon is a 5-player instance. It is not possible for 6 players to be in a dungeon at once.
You must be level 15 or higher to use the Dungeon Finder.
 Once you have entered the dungeon with your group, you will see a list of the dungeon bosses on the right of your screen. To complete the dungeon, your group must defeat all of the dungeon bosses.

It is recommended that you stick with your group and kill the enemies.
Once you complete the dungeon, you will gain a large amount of experience.

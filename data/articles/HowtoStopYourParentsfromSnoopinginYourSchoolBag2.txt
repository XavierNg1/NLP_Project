 If your parents have started going through your things, they may have a good reason. For instance, have you recently broken their trust by doing something explicitly against the rules? If so, you're going to have to earn their trust back by staying in line. If you don't give them a reason not to trust you, they may not feel the need to dig through your bag.

In addition, make sure you are doing your homework and giving them what paperwork you need to. Your parents may be going through your bag to make sure you aren't forgetting to give them important documents or forgetting important assignments.
 One way to make sure your parents don't snoop is to keep your bag with you at all times. If it's always in your line of sight, then they can't get in it without your knowledge.
 If your put your bag away, it's less of a temptation. Put it away in a place in your bedroom, such as your closet. If they can't see it, they may not remember to go through it.
 If there's only one or two smaller things that you want to keep private, try getting a little locked box or locked journal. Keep the key in a safe place or on your person.Understand that this approach could make your parents angry at you. In addition, many cheap locks can be easily picked, so be aware when you're buying one.
 If you can, keep your truly private items elsewhere. Maybe you can leave them at school in your locker, or maybe you can hide them in your room. Another option is keeping things at a friend's or relative's house.

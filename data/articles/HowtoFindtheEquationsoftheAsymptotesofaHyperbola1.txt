 We'll start with a simple example: a hyperbola with the center of its origin. For these hyperbolas, the standard form of the equation is x2/a2 - y2/b2 = 1 for hyperbolas that extend right and left, or y2/b2 - x2/a2 = 1 for hyperbolas that extend up and down.Remember, x and y are variables, while a and b are constants (ordinary numbers).



Example 1: x2/9 - y2/16 = 1

Some textbooks and teachers switch the position of a and b in these equations.Follow the equation closely so you understand what's going on. If you just memorize the equations you won't be prepared when you see a different notation.;
, This new equation represents both asymptotes, though it will take a little more work to separate them.Example 1: x2/9 - y2/16 = 0


, Factor the left hand side of the equation into two products. Refresh your memory on factoring a quadratic if you need to, or follow along while we continue Example 1:


We'll end up with an equation in the form (__ ± __)(__ ± __) = 0.

The first two terms need to multiply together to make x2/9, so take the square root and write it in those spaces: (x/3 ± __)(x/3 ± __) = 0

Similarly, take the square root of y2/16 and place it in the two remaining spaces: (x/3 ± y/4)(x/3 ± y/4) = 0

Since there are no other terms, write one plus sign and one minus sign so the other terms cancel when multiplied: (x/3 + y/4)(x/3 - y/4) = 0


, To get the equations for the asymptotes, separate the two factors and solve in terms of y.



Example 1: Since (x/3 + y/4)(x/3 - y/4) = 0, we know x/3 + y/4 = 0 and x/3 - y/4 = 0

Rewrite x/3 + y/4 = 0 → y/4 = - x/3 → y = - 4x/3

Rewrite x/3 - y/4 = 0 → - y/4 = - x/3 → y = 4x/3


, We've just found the asymptotes for a hyperbola centered at the origin. A hyperbola centered at (h,k) has an equation in the form (x - h)2/a2 - (y - k)2/b2 = 1, or in the form (y - k)2/b2 - (x - h)2/a2 = 1. You can solve these with exactly the same factoring method described above. Just leave the (x - h) and (y - k) terms intact until the last step.



Example 2: (x - 3)2/4 - (y + 1)2/25 = 1

Set this equal to 0 and factor to get:
((x - 3)/2 + (y + 1)/5)((x - 3)/2 - (y + 1)/5) = 0
Separate each factor and solve to find the equations of the asymptotes:
(x - 3)/2 + (y + 1)/5 = 0 → y = -5/2x + 13/2
((x - 3)/2 - (y + 1)/5) = 0 → y = 5/2x - 17/2

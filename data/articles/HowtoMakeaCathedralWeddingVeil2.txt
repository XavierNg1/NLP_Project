 Only fold it partially over, because you are making a blusher layer. A blusher is the part of the veil that is usually over your face as you walk down the aisle, and it is later pulled over the back of the head by the groom.


The length of the blusher can be based on your preference, so you may want to consider photos of veils you like before folding. Many women no longer follow this custom of walking down the aisle with a blusher. However, many still include it on their veil and fold it over their heads before they walk, giving them an extra full layer of veil.
 If you choose to gather the entire fold when you sew, your veil will be fuller. If you choose to only gather it from the center, it will lay flat on the sides.


You will want to start approximately one-third in, if you want to do a center gather. You will want to begin at the edge of the fold if you want to do a full gather.
 At the point where the blusher and long layers are folded, stitch in and out of the tulle. Use small even stitches so that your gathering will look uniform.


You do not need to knot the end of the thread; rather leave more than enough thread on the end so that you can knot it after it is gathered.
 You want your gather to be approximately 2 inches in width total, so that you can sew it to a hair comb of the same width.
, Make sure the gathering is extremely secure on the hair comb.

 Lean your back, butt, shoulders and head against the wall, and move your feet forward approximately 1.5 feet (46 cm). With your knees hip-width apart, bend your knees and lower yourself until you are in a chair-like position.


If you are just beginning to exercise, then hold the position for 3 seconds and slowly rise up again until your legs are straight. Do 2 sets of 10 repetitions. If you are more experienced, hold it for 10 seconds and do 2 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions. For an extra challenge, hold the seated position for 30 seconds to 5 minutes.
Make sure your knees never go over your toes, when you are in the seated squat position. If they do, then move your feet further away from the wall.;
, Slowly raise yourself up onto your toes and pause for 1 breath. Slowly lower yourself down onto your heels.


Feel free to use a wall for extra stability. This exercise tones the calves, but also helps your balance. Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions.
Once this becomes easy, hold a 3 to 5 lb. (1.4 to 2.27 kg) weight in each hand. Keep your hands at your sides, close to your thighs. Then, do the same calf raise exercise.
 Place your hands on your hips, and step 1 leg forward. Lower your body and your back shin until it is almost parallel to the ground.


Hold the position for 3 seconds and then slowly rise up again. Do the same motion with the opposite leg. Do 2 sets of 5 to 10 repetitions for each leg.

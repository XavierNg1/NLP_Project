 A major aspect of respeak is to always be present and live in the moment. Try and avoid discussing past events with your partner as a way to prove a point. Instead, focus solely on what is happening in the present because you are actually able to control and influence the present.For example, if your partner forgot to empty the dishwasher last week do not bring this up when you are discussing that they forgot to empty the dishwasher again this week. The event that took place in the past can not be changed.
 Even when you do think or speak about the past or future, understand that the emotions that you are experiencing are happening in the present and influence the way you feel in the present. For example, you may think, "Tomorrow is going to be an exciting day.” Using respeak you would change that thought to, “I excite myself thinking about tomorrow.”Alternatively you may say, “I have a troubled past.” This can be changed to, “I trouble myself with thoughts of the past.” By changing the wording you are refocusing your thoughts on the present.
This strategy can be very effective if you are having trouble ruminating on the past.
 People often use language that portrays themselves as passive victims. This happens all of the time in relationships. For example, you may say, “My partner frustrates me.” In this case, you are passive and your partner is acting upon you. Instead, you should say, “I frustrate myself with my partner.” By making this adjustment you become an active participant in your own experiences.Once you begin to think this way, you realize that you can modify your own actions, either by changing them or stopping them all together. You cannot change anyone but yourself, so it's important to focus on your own behaviors in a relationship and not your partner's.

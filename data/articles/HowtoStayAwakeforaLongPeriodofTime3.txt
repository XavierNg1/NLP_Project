 Set short, manageable goals for yourself. Break your time down into small chunks. Congratulate yourself when you reach these small goals.
 Often times, repeating a mantra can help focus your mind on something other than the difficult experience you are having. Good mantras are short, encouraging, and rhythmic.


Make up a mantra.
Use someone else’s mantra and repeat it. Try out: “Feeling strong, feeling good.”
Try out: “All the way! Hey let’s go! All the way to Tokyo!”
Try out: “Looking good, feeling good, oughta be in Hollywood.”, Plenty of people before you have stayed up for days on end. If you are truly committed to this goal, you will be able to succeed.


Say your goal out loud or write it down.
Visualize yourself succeeding.
When you feel doubtful, return to your goal. Say it out loud or look at what you have written down. State out loud that you can and will achieve your goal.

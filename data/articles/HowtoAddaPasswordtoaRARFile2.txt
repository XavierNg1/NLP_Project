 This is a lightweight archive program that can create simple RAR files. It is not as powerful as WinRAR on Windows, as the RAR format was developed by RARLAB, the creator of WinRAR.


WinRAR has a Mac version available as well, but it is in beta and only supports the Terminal. You can download it from rarlab.com/download.htm. Avoid using the "Get WinRAR FREE with TrialPay" option. This will attempt to install adware on your computer.
 A window will appear allowing you to add files to the new RAR file.
 You can drag and drop any files you'd like into the SimplyRAR window to add them to the list of files to be compressed and archived.
 This will tell SimplyRAR that you want to add a password when the RAR file is created.
 After checking the box, you will be prompted to create a password. You will need to enter it twice in order to use it.

 You will be asked to name the file and choose where you want to save it.


Note: Unlike WinRAR, you are not given the option to encrypt file names when password-protecting a RAR file.
 After the RAR file is created, you can double-click it to test it out. When you try to extract it, you will be prompted for the password you created.

 You do not want to drain a water heater that is in operation.


If you have a gas-powered water heater, turn the switch to "pilot" to keep the water heater's pilot light on, but stop the water from heating.
If you have an electric water heater, switch off the electrical switch that connects the heater to the electricity. This may be a switch in a board above the heater.;
, This can take several hours to half a day depending upon the size of the water heater.
 This inlet is often at the top of the heater, and it is where the water pours in before being heated.
, You may hear a hissing sound when you turn it.
 Most homes will need to drain the water from the water heater into a drain outdoors.


If you have an operable drain in a basement where the water heater is stored, you can opt to drain the heater with a water hose straight into your basement drain.



You can also choose to run the cool water into a garden or lawn. In this case, you may want to place a mesh screen above the lawn to trap water heater sediment. In this case, the cooler the water you are draining, the better.
 If it is above, you can simply string the hose outside and gravity will force the water downward.


If your water heater sits below ground level, you will need to purchase a small pump at a home improvement store. This pump can connect to a garden hose and reattach to another hose to pump the water outside or into a drain.
 Plug it in, if need be.
 This is usually located at the bottom of the tank. Use a wrench to secure it tightly.
, This will help you to see how much sediment is in the water.
 You can also check your mesh screen to see what has gathered.



Disconnect the garden hose, turn off the water tap and the pressure relief valve. Turn on the cold water intake.
Fill the tank again and drain it. For extremely bad sediment, you may need to do this until you no longer gather sediment.
 Perform regular water heater maintenance to improve water heater function.

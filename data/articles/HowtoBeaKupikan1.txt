 You are likely to be ignored if it has anything inappropriate, (Like IlyktoCyber or IHATEcatholics), or if you have too many numbers. The best usernames are simple ones.


A popular trend on Kupika is putting your name in lowercase, followed by a word starting with the same letter, or something random, such as lilyLOSER or chrisBANG.
Again, avoid numbers! They can be very annoying.
No matter what anyone says, shorter is better.;
, Don't call yourself degrading names, or brag about how popular you are. Put some interesting facts about you or maybe fill out a survey. Decorating it is a great idea, which will be covered in the next category.


Kupika is very big on using correct English and grammar. If you type "lyk dis", you most likely will be shunned.
 Pictures are appreciated on Kupika profiles, however the website was designed to be anonymous, so it is not needed whatsoever.
 Characters are the small avatars used to represent you throughout kupika. There is no right or wrong way to make a character, as everyone's is accepted. You can change this later for 1 KP at anytime.

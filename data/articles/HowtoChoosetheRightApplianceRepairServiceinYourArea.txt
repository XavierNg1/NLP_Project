 The very best way to find an appliance repair service is by referral. When someone you know recommends a company they were completely happy with (which includes service, price, professionalism, etc.) then you already know you're getting a good company. Just be sure you trust this person's opinion.;
, The ad you're looking at should say "licensed and insured" and should have the company's state license.
, A company with a long local history is a better bet than a recent startup with no history in the area.
(yellowpages.com, superpages.com, google maps, yahoo local, etc.)

,, A local person has a reputation to uphold locally. A representative of a large national chain however, may or may not be concerned about giving you the best deals or service.
 It's ok to ask them how long they've been repairing appliances and see if they will talk to you about your problem. If they are honest, they will discuss your problem with you. If you explain the symptoms you are experiencing with your appliance, they should be able to give you some possibilities of what type of repairs you may need. If they won't talk to you about it, you should consider that a red flag.
 For example: "Hello, I have a Kenmore gas dryer that was working fine until today. It still runs fine but there is no heat at all. If all I needed was a new igniter replaced, which is part number 279311, how much would the total repair cost me? I understand that you may find other things wrong and the estimate you give me over the phone could change, but all I'm asking is how much would it cost me if all you had to do was replace the 279311 igniter?" If they won't answer that question, it should be a red flag to you.

 It is much easier and more effective to clean your shoe laces once they have been removed from the shoes.;
, Dried and caked on dirt or mud should come off fairly easily with a little bit of scrubbing.
 You can also add a small amount of soap or laundry detergent to the water to help in the cleaning process.
 Use a spoon or spatula to agitate the laces in the water. You can use a dishwasher safe plate to weight the laces down and prevent them from floating









NOTE: Wear gloves and avoid putting your bare hands in the water with bleach as it may cause irritation of the skin.
 Place the laces, still inside the laundry bag, in the washing machine and launder with detergent and 1/2 cup of bleach in hot water., To avoid damage to the aglets and shrinkage of the laces, do not put them in a dryer. This can damage elastic fibers or structures that make the shoe stay laced longer. It may take several hours for your laces to dry completely.
 If the aglets were damaged in the cleaning process, you can use a piece of scotch tape to wrap the ends of the laces and make them easier to fit through the eyelets.

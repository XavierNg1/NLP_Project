 Greet your new acquaintance in a friendly but professional manner.
 If you are greeting a colleague or peer, you can be more informal. "Hi, Dan, it's a pleasure to meet you. I've heard great things about you, and am looking forward to working with you."


If you are meeting somebody much higher up in the food chain or an honoured and respected member of the community, consider an honorific rather than their first name. "Hi, Mr. Campbell. It's a pleasure to meet you," is much more professional and will make a much better lasting impression than saying, "Hi, Bill. How's it hangin'?"
Consider greeting somebody at a much more junior level than you, in the same way. "Hello, Mr. Crawford. It's a pleasure to meet you," carries with it the expectation that they will keep a professional attitude in their dealings with you.
 Nobody likes being pigeon-holed into a conversation they can't get out of, and it's especially important in a business setting. You don't want to have the reputation of somebody that doesn't know when to be quiet!

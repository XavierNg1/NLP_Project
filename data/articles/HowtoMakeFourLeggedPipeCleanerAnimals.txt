 Bend the two pipe cleaners, one inch (2.5cm) from both sides, to make legs.;
, Leave the hind legs free.
 Save the end of the pipe cleaner to form the neck.
 Then, cut 2 inches (5cm) off another pipe cleaner and loop that one around the top of the head to form the animal's ears. Use the remainder of the cut pipe cleaner for the tail, which is looped at the top of the hind legs.

 There are some common deal breakers for people dating in their older age. Things like health, financial security, and physical appearance are very important to most seniors who are dating. Before you start looking for a partner, know what qualities you want to avoid.For example, if you think you could really like someone but they are very ill already, you might consider just being their friend and dating someone else.;
, Some people reach retirement age and are ready to travel the world. Others simply want to relax and enjoy their home and neighborhood. You should be honest with yourself about how you want to live life, and date people who enjoy the same things. Do not try to force yourself to do what you think you are ‘supposed’ to do.For example, if you want to travel, it would be a bad idea to date someone who is terrified of airplanes.
 Most older people have had much more experience in life and are more likely to be open to dating someone that makes them feel cared for and happy. You should be willing to compromise some of your less important restrictions (e.g. hair color or music preference) so that you can find someone who meets your most important needs. As you grow comfortable with your own identity, many of these things will matter very little to you anyway.For example, you might really like the idea of dating someone that is exactly 65, but if you find a great date who’s 68, it might be worth compromising.

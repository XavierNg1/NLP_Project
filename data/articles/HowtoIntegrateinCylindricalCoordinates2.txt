 The bottom of the cylinder will be on the z=0{\displaystyle z=0} plane for simplicity of calculations.


∫Vrdrdθdz=∫0Rrdr∫02πdθ∫0hdz=(12R2)(2π)(h)=πR2h{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{V}r{\mathrm {d} }r{\mathrm {d} }\theta {\mathrm {d} }z&=\int _{0}^{R}r{\mathrm {d} }r\int _{0}^{2\pi }{\mathrm {d} }\theta \int _{0}^{h}{\mathrm {d} }z\\&=\left({\frac {1}{2}}R^{2}\right)(2\pi )(h)\\&=\pi R^{2}h\end{aligned}}}

Note that we could have swapped the integrals. The end result would be the same. However, in more general cases, the boundaries will not stay the same, so the order in which you integrate does matter.

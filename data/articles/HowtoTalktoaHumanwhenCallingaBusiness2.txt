 Or repeat "operator" or "agent;" say "I would like to speak with a human being." Since these systems often miss the first 1/4 second of your statement, full sentences allow for a clearer understanding.
 Don't say anything distinguishable. If the system hears you making sounds and cannot distinguish words, it usually asks you to repeat yourself twice, then gives up and sends you to customer service.

Refrain from yelling at the system, as tempted as you might be. Most systems are designed to respond to a regular tone of voice and will only ask you to repeat yourself if you speak loudly.

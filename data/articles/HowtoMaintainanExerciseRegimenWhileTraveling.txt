 Pack exercise clothing, including shoes and cold or wet weather outer garments. Review your route for parks, open space greens on airport grounds, and rest stops.;
, Walk briskly for a few minutes to warm cramped and cold muscles, then open up and jog for as long as your itinerary will allow. And besides, who would think you odd for running through an airport? Stretch before reembarking.
 Most hotels house at least small fitness rooms equipped with weights and machines in addition to pools and greens. As travelers often find after a long day in the air or on the road, exhaustion may limit the amount of exercise you can comfortably manage, at least without being off your game the next day.   

, If you find yourself within walking distance of your intended destination (coffee shop, conference center, etc.), do so instead of taking a taxi. Walk briskly but avoid running with a "face forward" destination, especially in any clothing other than jogging apparel, as this can cause unrest in those around you.
 If your space is severely limited such as a cramped hotel room, try space conserving exercises. Sit-ups, flutter-kicks, push-ups, bracing in half-squat, and lifting improvised weights (luggage, wet towels, etc.) can burn some big calories and keep you fit. Be mindful of your neighbors--above, below, and to the sides--as many of these exercises are loud and repetitive. 

, Allow for several days of reconditioning if you've lost some ground.

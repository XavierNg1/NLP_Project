 The landing page is the first page of your website that a visitor sees. It must be appealing enough to keep visitors on your site and looking around.


Use a great picture. For example, if you are a surfing instructor or a company that charters boats, use a photo of the ocean or a beautiful wave. If you run a spa, feature a tranquil pool or a relaxing waterfall.
Write engaging text. Something like "Your vacation starts here" or "Join us in Paradise" will appeal to your visitors.;
, As a professional in the tourism business, you pictures should look like dream vacations and perfect getaways.


Use maps as well as pictures. If you run a bed and breakfast, you will want to show visitors where you are located and how to reach you.
 If you specialize in walking tours of a specific city, you might want a brief video demonstrating what will be seen. A hotel might include a video that touches on each service and amenity.
 You do not want your site to appear cluttered or confusing. A simple and beautiful site is best.


Ensure that the entire site is designed with your brand in mind. You want your tourism business logo and brand to be noticed.

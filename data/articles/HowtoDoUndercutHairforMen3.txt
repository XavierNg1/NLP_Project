 If the hair that remains above the disconnect line is longer than 4-6 inches, it will need to be cut. As you work toward the back of the disconnect line, the hair will need to be progressively shorter to keep it from hanging down over the back of the head.Hair closer to the forehead will be able to remain 4-6 inches long. But hair closer to the rear of the head might need to be cut down to one inch or less. With the recipient of the undercut for men in profile, cut the hair in rows.
For example, you might cut the one-inch-wide row closest to the front of the forehead to a length of six inches. The one-inch-wide row that follows it, which sits closer to the back of the head, might have a length of five inches. And the one-inch-wide row that follow that one might be even shorter, with a length of four inches.
Some men like to keep the hair above the disconnect line long and tie it into a topknot or bun. Ask the recipient of the undercut hair for men whether they wish the hair above the disconnect line to remain long.
 If the man receiving the undercut knows he wants to part it, ask which side he parts from. If he wants, you could keep the top hair (the bit above the disconnect line) longer on the side from which he parts it. This will better allow the hair to lay flat when parted.For example, if the hair will be parted from right to left, the hair just above the disconnect line on the right side of the head might be closer to six inches long, while the hair on the left side of the head might be closer to four or five inches long.
 Go over the sideburns and edges of the hair with an unguarded number zero clipper to achieve straighter edges. Try to achieve a straight, sloping line from the back of the ears to the neck, and a smooth curve along the hairline around the back of the neck. Remove any straggling neck hair creeping down the neck. Donâ€™t forget to clip stray hair that may hide behind the ears.Wash the hair out in a hairdresser sink. Dry it with a towel.

, If you don’t remember how you used to play as a child, ask your parents or guardians. You might have had some supernatural experiences disguised as play. Some of these experiences include:


You had an imaginary friend. Often, adults label the spirits or supernatural being children interact with as “imaginary friends.”

You read children’s books centering around the spiritual or supernatural.

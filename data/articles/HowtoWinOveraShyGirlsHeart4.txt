 Spend a lot of time getting to know her and letting her get to know you. Building trust is the key to a relationship with a shy girl. Ask her to do things with you that do not involve large crowds. An evening walk or a movie night at your house might be better than going out to the theater with large crowds of people., Although she is shy, not introducing her to your friends and family could make her even more self-conscious. Just be careful not to introduce her to everyone all at once. Create opportunities for her to meet friends and family in small groups or one at a time.For example, you could go to dinner with just your parents as opposed to bringing her to a large family gathering such as Thanksgiving.
 Though you should avoid pushing her to move the relationship too quickly, make it clear that you are serious. Many shy people are self-conscious and might not assume that you want a relationship with them. By telling her how you feel, you give her the opportunity to think about how she feels.


Mention that you have feelings for her by saying things like “I do really like spending time with you. I hope to do it more often.”

, Shy girls often have trust issues. You will need to earn her trust and not expect it to be given freely.Be honest.
Be reliable.

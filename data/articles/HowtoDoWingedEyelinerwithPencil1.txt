 Before you begin the process of applying eyeliner, dab some primer onto your eyelids. Use your fingers to gently rub in the primer. This will make your eyeliner and any eyeshadow you use stand out more.









Make sure to wash your hands before you apply your eyeliner.;
, When selecting an eyeliner pencil, go for a creamier brand of eyeliner. In general, creamier and thicker eyeliners will more easily spread on your lash line.Opt for pencils that can be sharpened.
Bigger pencils will create bigger wings, while smaller pencils will create smaller, finer lines.
 Start applying eyeliner at the inner corner of your upper lash line. You do not want any visible space between the eyeliner and the lash line, so draw your eyeliner as close to the lash line as possible.








Close your eye and pull the lid so it's straight. This will give you better control.Start by making one small line, wiggling it between each eyelash. Then, add a second line thickening the first.
 You want your line to stretch all the way across your lash line. Use sideways, swiping motions to continue drawing your line along your lash line. As you're going to morph your line into wings, thicken the line as you go. It should get thicker as you move towards the outer corners of your eyes.
 The line should move up and outward as it approaches the end of your eyelid. The wing will point towards the tip of your eyebrow. Use this as guidance as you draw your line.








Again, start with a wiggling line and then reapply the eyeliner to thicken the line.
 Even after applying eyeliner carefully, you may have some gaps in color or spots where the line is uneven. You may have to draw over the line a few times. This is to fill in any gaps and get the line to your desired thickness. After drawing the first line or eyeliner along your lash line, fill it in as necessary.








How thick you want the line is up to you. When reapplying the eyeliner, add eyeliner until it's at your desired thickness.

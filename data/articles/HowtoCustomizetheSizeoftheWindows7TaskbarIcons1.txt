 You will need to right-click on a blank spot of the taskbar; right-clicking on an icon will pull up the wrong menu. You can usually find blank space at the right end of the taskbar, between the last icon and the System Tray.


If you are having difficulty right-clicking on a blank spot, you can also access the menu from the Appearance and Personalization menu in the Control Panel. Click the "Taskbar and Start Menu" option.;
, This will open the Taskbar and Start Menu Properties window. This menu will allow you to customize the way icons are displayed on your task bar.
 Use the "Taskbar buttons" drop-down menu to choose how icons should be displayed. You can choose to "Always combine, hide labels", which will stack icons for the same program and only show the icons, "Combine when taskbar is full", which will only stack icons when there is no room on the taskbar and will show each window's label next to the icon, and "Never combine", which prevents any stacking and will show each window's label next to the icon.
 By default, taskbar icons will be shown at regular size. You can toggle them to a smaller size by checking the "Use small taskbar buttons" box and clicking Apply. Using this method, you can choose between the regular size and the smaller size.

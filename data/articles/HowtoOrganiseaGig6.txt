, This is the minimum amount you can charge per ticket to break even. You may like to run your first gig as non profit, to get people in your area interested in local gigs.


If you want to make a profit, add on about 20% to this figure, but always have a round ticket price. It must be divisible by either 2 or 5. For example 11 is not OK but 12 or 10 is fine.
 If they don't print tickets, sell tickets on the door; there will be no paper and/or forged tickets involved this way. Use a hand stamp on people as they arrive. Get an original stamp, but remember, unless it's hand made someone else could have one. So get an original colour ink pad to use, and change the colour and stamp for every gig you run.

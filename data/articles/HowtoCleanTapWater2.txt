 If you want to check on the status of your local water, contact the local water utility company or the local government authorities. Start by looking on your water bill for a number to contact the water company. You can also contact the city or town hall about reports on local water quality.You can also try calling the local health department.
 When you talk to someone from the local water authority, you need to know the right questions to ask. You can ask basic questions, like is there fluoride added to the water and when was the last time the EPA tested the water. You can also ask if they use any other disinfectants than chlorine.You can ask about the source of the water. Groundwater is generally cleaner due to the natural filtering from the soil. Surface water has a tendency to pick up more pollutants.
If they tell you that the EPA has tested the water, ask for the results. You can also ask for a copy of the test results since by law they have to provide you with information about water contaminants.
 If you cannot get any information from your local water authorities, you can try contacting the EPA. You can look up your local city’s “Consumer Confidence Report.”You may also contact the EPA safe drinking water hotline at 1-800-426-4791.You may also contact the EPA via their online form found here.You can also email the EPA at hotline-sdwa@epamail.epa.gov.

You can find approved labs by contacting the EPA hotline.The cost of testing the water ranges from $25 to $100, depending on the thoroughness of your test.

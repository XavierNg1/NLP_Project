 Pour your desired amount of milk into a microwave-safe glass or mug and heat in the microwave for 45 seconds.
 Use a coffee press, also called a French press, that has a glass container and a plunger. Pour the milk you heated into the glass container.
 Use the plunger of the coffee press to press up and down through the milk in the container repeatedly until it looks frothy and approximately double its original volume.
 Pour the milk foam into your espresso, using a spoon to hold back the thicker foam to allow the liquid milk to pour out first. Then spoon the foam on top of your milk and espresso.For a cappuccino, use about the same amount of warm liquid milk as milk foam to add to your espresso. For a latte, use about twice the amount of liquid milk as milk foam. To achieve this, you may need to warm up more milk in the microwave to get the right amount.

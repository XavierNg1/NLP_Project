 If you'd rather round up songs by a certain artist or album, click the Artist or Album by Artist tabs.
 Holding down the appropriate button lets you select more than one song at once. When you need to scroll through the list to select a song further up or down the list, release the key, scroll, then hold the key again before clicking the song.
 Again, this does not permanently delete files from your computer. You can add the songs to other playlists at any time.

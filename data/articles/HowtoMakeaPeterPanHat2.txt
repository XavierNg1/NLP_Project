 All you need here are a few simple supplies to make your own Peter Pan Hat. You can use whatever kind of paper you want, but green construction paper will get you the best look.


Green construction paper that’s at least 12” x 18”.
Pencil.
Scissors.
Glue.
Red feather.
Ruler.
 Take your paper and fold it over into a rectangle that’s 9” x 12”.









You should fold the paper so that the crease is on the 9” inch side while the open ends are on the 12” long side.
 This is the same process from the first method above.
 Now simply cut out the shape of your hat.









Start at one corner that’s opposite of your crease and cut along your outline.
You should have somewhat of a triangular shape here with a flat, non-creased edge at the bottom, which is where your head will go.
 Now take the bottom part of your hat and fold up the paper to create the brim of your Peter Pan hat.









Make a nice crease by pressing your finger along the fold.
To make sure that both folds are of even height, flip your hat over after the first fold and fold the second flap up to match.
 Connect the edges from the base of the hat, where the brim is, all the up to the tip.









The slight folding over of the edges will give your Peter Pan hat a nice rounded, more natural look.
If you want to glue them together you should now apply it to the edges. While any type of glue should work, something like a safe rubber cement, which has a brush might be the easiest method.
You can also simply staple the open edges together.
Or, if you want to add a bit more flair to your Peter Pan hat, you can sew the edges together like in the first method.
 Simply make a small cut on the side your hat for your feather.









Alternatively, you place the stem of the feather inside your brim crease and glue or staple it in place.

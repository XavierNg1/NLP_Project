 This can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the location of the joint, its size and the level of your commitment to the process. There are times when one simply MUST do a caulked joint, and times when the quick, cheap, and easy nature of PVC makes the choice a 'no-brainer'.
 It's pretty much impossible to get a leak-free repair from a partial replacement of the original seal., Old screwdrivers make good improvised caulking irons.

Pack each with several turns of oakum so as to make a relatively solid joint between the pipes. These layers are continually hammered into the joint, around and around, until there's only one inch of space between the top of the oakum and the rim of the hub.
 The remaining one-inch space will be filled with molten lead in one continuous pour, and the surface of the lead hammered around and around the circumference of the joint ensures a solid seal between the iron and the lead. Horizontal joints require the use of a joint runner, which is a non-combustible rope which is clamped around the top of the joint with a space at the top into which the molten lead is poured., Oakum must be hammered so as to compress and seal the gap between pipes. Joint runners permit the pouring of vertical joints in horizontal pipes.

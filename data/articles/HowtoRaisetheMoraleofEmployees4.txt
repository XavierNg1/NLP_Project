 Companies, like Google, famously employ a fun, open, relaxed work space. Add a pool table. Build a bar for coffee or drinks. Take out that florescent lighting. Bring in a living wall. I has been found that the quality of the working environment outweighs professional experience as a predictor of the quality of client care and employee morale. Additionally, those in management positions are more likely to rate the environment positively than employees working under them., Reward your employees for a job well done. Pizza lunches, casual Fridays and half days may increase motivation if you offer these perks occasionally. Make some of these things regular, and make some of them a surprise. This way you can avoid the rewards becoming monotonous, too.
 If part of their job duties includes sales, this can include sales goals. Having something to work toward can increase motivation, up-selling and profit potential. Give out a small prize or publicly recognize the winner for their accomplishment, however small. It's a win-win situation for the employees and the company.
 Don't make it mandatory, make it desirable. You won't know what your employees find worthwhile if you force them to do everything. Gauge your outing's success, not your employees' success, by the level of interest.


Go camping.
Have a bar crawl.
Go skydiving.

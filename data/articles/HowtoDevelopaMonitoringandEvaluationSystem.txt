 If your organization already exists, you will be looking at losses, risks and underperforming departments. If the organization is still forming, you want to look ahead to problems you anticipate.


This step can also include listing the things you want to learn about how your organization performs.;
, Indicators should be concrete and measurable, as well as objective as possible. Without consistent measurability, it's difficult to develop a meaningful framework for monitoring and evaluating the different processes in your organization.
 This includes the scale you will use, the points at which you will make observations, and the frequency with which you will record and measure.
 This can just be a sentence or two. At this stage, you're still developing the plan, not writing a formal process document.
 Multiple people can hold multiple job descriptions, or you can assign them to individuals best placed to make and understand the observations.


It's best to assign a title to the job description rather than a specific individual. If the line manager is responsible for a task, the task will get done by whomever the line manager is. If it's Don's job, the task stops getting done when Don gets promoted or retires.
 In some cases, you'll base the analysis by comparing the reality to benchmarks you set. In others, you'll base it on growth or decline as compared to other time periods. New companies might use industry averages, or use the first set of measurements as a baseline.
 Hand it off to somebody you trust who hasn't been involved up to this point. Ask that person to read it and report anything that doesn't make sense.

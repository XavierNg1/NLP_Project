 Studying can help you a lot, though you don't want to cram yourself with too much information. Usually one subject is taken each week, so study the weekend before the test and any extra days you might have to study. Study that one subject and make sure to cover the areas which you have the most trouble with. If you need extra practice, you can get extra work from a teacher, use textbook questions, or play online math games. Remember to not cram your head with a lot of confusing information, especially the night before the test.;
, Your mind needs time to relax and calm itself before taking the test. If you spend all of your time studying, you'll be tired and might end up falling asleep in the middle of the test!

, If you are required to bring something, remember to bring it. Usually the teachers/staff who you are with during the test can provide #2 pencils and erasers, but it's always good to be prepared.
 You will need at least 9 hours of sleep each night. Scientists say that if you get 9 hours of sleep, all the information learned will actually stay in your mind. Sleeping can also rest your mind.
 This will keep the information fresh in your mind. You can do this by making a practice worksheet the day before or using flashcards. There are also flashcard apps so you have all your information on your electronics.
 If you eat a very sugary breakfast, you might have a sugar rush and end up crashing! Eating things such as eggs, fruit, and bread will help you; these are all healthy foods. Make sure to have some water so you can stay hydrated (and not pass out!).
 Don't freak out. If you are nervous, you're not the only one! All of your classmates are stressed too, but keeping calm is the key to getting a great grade.

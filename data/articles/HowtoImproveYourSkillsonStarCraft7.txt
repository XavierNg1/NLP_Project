 For example, know that a typical attack unit will go after a target that has attacked them (excluding workers and units incapable of attacking a target).
 An amazing pioneered by (name) basically used the fact that Lurkers can only kill what their spines touch, and that Marines/Lurkers attack times, if known, can be exploited.
 It basically means you put about a half of your army on the frontline and defend with it, and the other force away from the base, able to strike the backlines of enemy's attacking army. This is helpful, because your units (especially those with tough pathfinding, like Dragoons) don't have to dance around at the backlines because they don't have enough room to maneuver. It also doesn't let your enemies escape from the battle. Speed upgrades are helpful in doing this (Zealots, Zerglings), and if you are Zerg, you can burrow your units on the flank.
, It's good to send Dragoons to harass your Terran enemy by blocking any SCV scouting attempts or Vulture mine harassing attempts, but it becomes foolish to let those Dragoons die on mines or after Tanks get their powerful Siege upgrade. If you lose your force without accomplishing anything (for example, slowing down his macro by smashing his Supply Depots/Pylons/Overlords or killing a fair share of his own units), the enemy can use his victorious force to block you or even kill you.

If you don’t hear two quick beeps (or see “What can I help you with?” on the screen), open your iPhone’s Settings, tap Siri, and slide the “Siri” switch to the On (green) position.If your phone supports it, you can also launch Siri by saying “Hey Siri.”

,, Siri should respond with, “What’s the subject of your email?”


If Siri doesn’t recognize the name, she will say “I couldn’t find <name> in your contacts. To whom shall I send it?” Try a different name, or say an email address., This is the text that will appear in the “subject” line. Just say a few words that quickly explain the nature of the message.
 When you stop speaking, Siri will display the contents of the email and ask, “Ready to send?”


If you’re not satisfied, you could say “Change subject” or “Change message” to start again. You can also add another line to the message by saying “Add <whatever you want to add>.”

,


You could also combine some or all of these steps into a single phrase. For example, “Email Maria I can’t find my keys so I need you to stay home.” Siri will ask for any missing information (in this case, a subject).

 Beside the fact that you should be talking to them already, this opens up a dialogue and hopefully improves your communication with your child.;
, You don't have to rely on just a school. There might be a place for your child to express their inner thespian! Some options are:


Drama
Sports
Cheerleading
Chess

, Your older children might not like a hovering parent. If it's a sport, consider being a coach or an assistant. If you have a good camera, be the event photographer!

, Don't be afraid of using your vehicle for transportation (unless it's tiny like a Mazda Miata!).
 Don't let them get into too many activities and make sure you are able to keep things balanced as well.

 Humans are supposed to have earwax — it has the important job of protecting our ears from bacteria and fungus. It’s rare to have so much earwax that it has to be removed; however, if you have ear pain, a feeling of fullness or pressure in your ear, or hearing loss, see your doctor to make sure that the problem is excessive earwax and not something else.Earwax removal is most safely done by a healthcare professional.Using peroxide can cause ear damage if your ear problem isn’t due to excess earwax.
If your doctor okays it, you can proceed to using peroxide at home. Ask for advice on selecting and using at-home ear cleaning products.;
, Pharmacies and drug stores often sell ready-made earwax-removal kits that can be easy to use at home. Often, these kits contain earwax-softener like Debrox or Murine — products that contain a mild form of peroxide. The kits may also include bulb syringes or other tools you might need., If you want to use products you already have at home, you can. The cleaning process should take about 30 – 45 minutes. Gather and prepare the following materials before you start to clean your ears:An oil to soften the earwax, such as mineral oil, baby oil, olive oil, or glycerin
Hydrogen peroxide, or a carbamide peroxide solution available at most drug stores

The peroxide must be diluted — make sure you get peroxide that is 3% or lower in strength.Two medium-sized bowls
An eyedropper
A rubber bulb syringe
A clean towel

, Putting cold fluids in your ear can be uncomfortable, so warm up the oil and peroxide before using them.Fill two bowls with hot water. Place the bottle of peroxide in one, and the bottle of oil in the other. Let them sit for a few minutes to warm. You could also put the oil and peroxide into two smaller bowls and place those in the hot water.


Test the temperature of the oil and peroxide on the skin of your hand before putting it into your ear. It should be warm, not hot.

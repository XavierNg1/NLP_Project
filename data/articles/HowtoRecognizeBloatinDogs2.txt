 Remember, bloat is a life-threatening condition and not amenable to first aid at home. It is essential to seek immediate veterinary assistance.Even if you have financial constraints and cannot afford surgery, the humane option is to contact a veterinarian to euthanize your dog to prevent unnecessary suffering. While this can be a hard decision to make, it will ultimately save your dog from a lot of pain.
 Veterinary treatment includes aggressive intravenous fluid therapy to support the circulation and dilute systemic toxins. Once your dog is stable, the vet will give him general anesthesia and laparotomy; the stomach is repositioned and an incision made to release the gas.


The stomach is then rinsed out, any portions of dead stomach wall resected, and the stomach sutured to the body wall to prevent future episodes of torsion.
 If you are not within traveling distance of a veterinarian then try to comfort your dog. Speak to him calmly to reassure him. In the early stages of bloat try gently walking him, to help relieve stomach cramps. Stay by him and keep him calm. Try to find a vet who will come to where you are if you cannot transport your dog to a vet.Medication or pain relief is of no benefit because it cannot pass the twist in his gullet to enter the stomach and be absorbed.

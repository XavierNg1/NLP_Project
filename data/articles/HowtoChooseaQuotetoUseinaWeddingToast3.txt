 Maybe you know how their favorite movie relates to “their song.” Choose a quote you know they'll identify with. It makes your toast even more personalized and shows you pay attention.For example, for a couple who likes the movie Notting Hill and the song “Ain't No Mountain High Enough,” you could say:


Like William and Anna, our happy couple drifted in and out of each other's lives before finally making a commitment. It's as if there “ain't no mountain high enough / ...no valley low enough / ...no river wide enough” to keep them apart.
 A quote doesn't have to come from somebody famous. Think of a quip from another friend or relative. Maybe one partner's grandparent has a few popular sayings that fit the theme. Perhaps something the happy couple says to each other might be perfect for your toast.You could try: something like:


Jenny's grandmother always says, “True love is like the universe. It's beautiful, endless, and always has something new to teach us.” I can see those words come alive when I look at Jenny and Susie. After 10 years together, they still keep their relationship vibrant with regular pleasant surprises.
 Think of a moment that you shared with half the couple. Maybe you found a quote in a college literature assignment that made you laugh. If that doesn't work, consider a quote that reminds you of the couple.You could say:


There's a famous scene in Shakespeare's play Much Ado About Nothing when Benedick blurts out to Beatrice, “I love nothing in the world so well as you.” Every time I read that scene, I think of Bob and Johnny.

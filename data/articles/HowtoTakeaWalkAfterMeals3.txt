 To maintain a consistent schedule, write both your meal and your walks into your calendar. If you keep a digital schedule, block off time for both so that you do not feel rushed or too busy for your walk., Starting a heavy walking schedule might not be helpful if you did not walk at all before. You may only want to start taking a walk a few days a week, or you might start by only taking a walk after dinner., If you feel as though you donâ€™t have time in the morning to walk, you may want to set your alarm for fifteen or thirty minutes earlier. You will not lose much sleep, and this extra time will give you a little more room to squeeze in a post-breakfast walk., A walk can be a great time to chat with your friends, and it will help both of you get in your daily exercise. If you have a friend waiting for you, you're less likely to skip the walk.At work, you may ask one of your coworkers if they would like to take a walk with you during your lunch break.
At home, your partner or kids might want to join you.
Even your dog can be a great companion on walks. Walking the dog after every meal sets an important schedule for them and you.
 If you want to fit in a walk during your lunch hour, you should bring your lunch instead of ordering takeout or visiting a restaurant. This will save you time. You can use half of your lunch hour to eat and the other half to take a walk.

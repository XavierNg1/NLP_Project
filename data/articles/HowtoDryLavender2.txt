 Harvest lavender just before the buds open. Cut at the base of the stems to preserve as much stem as possible.
 A cutting board or another large piece of wood is perfect for drying lavender in the sun. If you use a metal tray, the lavender will get too hot; if you use plastic, you might have a melted mess on your hands.
 Move the cutting board or wood block to a place that gets plenty of sun, either indoors or outdoors. Drying lavender this way is a much quicker process than drying it in the dark, but be prepared for the sun to fade the lavender to a very pale purple color.


If you live in an area that gets a lot of rain, either dry the lavender inside near a sunny window or be ready to move it inside when the clouds threaten to break.
 It should take under a week for the hot sun to dry the lavender. Check every few days to see whether the lavender is dry. When it's ready, the flowers should crumble easily from the stems.

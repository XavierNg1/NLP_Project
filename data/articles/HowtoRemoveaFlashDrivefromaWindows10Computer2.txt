 The easiest way to do this in any open window is to hold down Ctrl and press S.
 To do this, you can either click the Windows icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen, or you can press the âŠž Win key on your computer's keyboard. Opening the Start menu will automatically place your mouse cursor in the "Search" bar.
 Doing so will search your computer for the "This PC" program.
 It's a computer monitor-shaped image at the top of the Start menu's search window. Doing so will open This PC.
 It will appear below the "Devices and drives" heading that's in the middle of the page; typically, your flash drive will be on the right side of this page.


You'll usually see "(E:)" or "(F:)" after the flash drive's name.
 A drop-down menu will appear.
 It's near the middle of the drop-down menu. Once you do this, the flash drive's name should disappear from the This PC window.
 Once this notification displays in the bottom-right side of your computer's screen, your flash drive is ready for removal.
 It should slide out. The next time you plug your flash drive into your computer, all of your files should be as you left them.

 You don't need to be the one who never wears the same outfit twice or has designer clothes but instead just care about what you wear. Don't throw on sweatpants and a graphic tee and go to school looking like you went through a fashion tornado, one thing you can do is to plan your outfit out the night before. Try not to wear the same shirt or pants two days in a row. No one likes anyone who wears ugly and revealing clothes, so keep it modest and cute. Wear clothes from brandy Melville, urban outfitters (they have awesome sales sometimes), forever 21, abercrombie, a&f, or whatever the popular girls wear.;
, Wash your face 2 times everyday; in the morning, and when you go to bed. Wash with lukewarm water for 30 - 45 seconds. Drink half your weight in ounces ex. if you are 100 pounds drink 50 ounces, this will help keep your skin clear. Brush your hair and straighten if it is frizzy and uncontrollable. For static, spray your hair gently with water, but don't make it sopping wet.
 Laugh at other people's jokes! Make your own jokes is you think they can be funny enough, either about you or others or what's going on. Remember though, don't be rude when saying jokes.
 no one likes someone who follows them around and tries to join in the conversation. If a popular girl walks past say, "hey, your sweater is cute!" or any compliment that could start a conversation.
 It is both healthy and can help you achieve a more toned body. Also, joining a sports team will help you meet more people.
, Talk to boys every chance you get, don't flirt unless you like them but it is always nice to have friends who are boys. When there is a dance with other schools it will also be good to have friends from other schools because it will make you seem more popular and established. Don't be the mean, bossy one that no one likes, make most of the kids think you are kind and caring, though they don't have to love you either.

 Start with the napkin facing you in the square position. Make sure that your napkin is open and flat before you begin your fold. Apply pressure with your hand if you would like a more crisp look to your sailboat. A tight fold will also allow the use of more fabric in your sailboat., Make sure when you make this fold, the open edges are towards your body. Pull the corner all the way down until it is about one inch from the bottom edge. This should create a right angle. Apply pressure to the fold with your hand for a more crisp look., Fold it all the way to the left. Make sure the corner of the flap is flush, and even, with the corner you press it against. Press your hand against the fold to create a crisp crease., Pull the corner from left to right. Make sure the edge lines up nice and smooth. Crease the fold with your hand. If the fabric becomes too thick to crease, use a heavy object like a paperweight to make the fold. If you prefer a more "fluid" sail, don't crease the fold. There should be 1/2-1 inch of excess fabric left at the bottom of your napkin, after you complete this fold., You will want to make sure that you fold it upwards at least 2 inches (5.1 cm). This flap will form the boat in your sailboat. Adjust this fold upwards or downwards if you want a smaller or larger boat., There are two major folds of fabric, both of which have been lifted up 2 inches (5.1 cm). The flap away from the "sail" you want to separate away from the flap closest to the "sail." Use your thumb and fold one of the flaps upwards. Take the other flap and fold it backwards. Smooth out the edges of the flaps and you now have a napkin wind-drawn sailboat.

 Get some gel and spike your hair as often as possible. Rigid spikes are so Bart Simpson! Keep the clothes simple-just T-shirts and shorts.;
, Practice when you get home from school, on the weekends, and in every spare minute you get. Try getting help from a person who's really good at it, and be patient. When you're good, teach yourself tricks like jumps and stuff. Skate to school.
 Have smart comebacks to everything, an "innocent" look and voice, and ways of entertaining the class, such as mouthing everything a teacher says in a lecture.
 If your Dad is the type of guy that doesn't know a joke, don't do it.
 Bart is also well known for his genius pranks that work, great. If your a noob in the pranking world, start small then work to get up.
 Just stay calm and cool.
 Always ignore what adults tell you to do, and test them. Whenever someone tells you to do something, ask "why?" and keep up that attitude till you've won.
 You could use Bart's but then you look a bit like a wannabe., Plus, try to know a lot about the actual Bart Simpson.

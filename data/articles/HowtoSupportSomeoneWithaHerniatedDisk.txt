 Back pain occurs in many ways and is caused by numerous ailments. In order to heal correctly a professional must first correctly diagnose patients.;
, If the herniated disk is causing the person pain, they should remain lying down and resting. You will need to cater to them as needed. Be available to wait on them and keep them company.
 Stress can intensify the pain. Breathing and relaxation therapies may help.
, The doctor may prescribe prescription medication or over the counter medication may suffice. The medication will be a painkiller or muscle relaxer.
 Applying heat or ice to the area experiencing pain can help to alleviate the symptoms.
 Patients with herniated disks should avoid constipation as any straining could aggravate the already strained disk.
 If the patient must stand, carefully place your arm around their back under their armpits helping them to stand and walk. Avoid the areas experiencing pain.
 Big cushioning chairs will curve the spine causing more strain and pain on the herniated disk.
 When the pain begins to wear away or if they have been suffering only light pain, keep them moving. Lying down will only stiffen and tighten the muscles.

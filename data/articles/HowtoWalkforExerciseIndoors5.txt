 If you’re walking at home, a good place to put the treadmill is in front of the television. That way, you can enjoy a show or movie while getting a great workout. If you’re at the gym, bring a tablet or phone with a large screen and place it on the console where the treadmill’s controls are. Stream shows from your device while you walk.Many gyms offer treadmills with televisions attached, or in front of the treadmill. Call local gyms to find one that offers this feature.
 One of the great things about walking indoors is that you don’t have to deal with the many challenges that you do when walking outside. Since there’s no automobile traffic, cracked sidewalks, irregular lighting, or roots and branches to contend with, walking while listening to a portable music device is perfectly alright., Walking together is a great opportunity to catch up and bond with a friend or family member. Plus, it will keep you motivated and excited to walk indoors for exercise. If you have a friend or family member who is also looking to get more exercise, invite them to join you.If you can’t get a friend to accompany you, bring a phone (preferably with a wireless headset) to chat with friends and family while you walk.
 There are many walking clubs that exclusively or occasionally walk indoors. Check your local community bulletin or online events calendar to locate a walking club near you.If you can’t find a walking club near you, consider starting one. All you have to do is act as the coordinator. Post a flier in your local library or reach out online through sites like Meetup.com or Craigslist.org.

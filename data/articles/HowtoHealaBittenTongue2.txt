 Take 1 cup (250mL) of warm tap water. Add 1 tsp (5 g) of salt and mix with a spoon. Swish this mixture in your mouth for 15 to 20 seconds and then spit it out. You can repeat this process up to three times a day until healed. It is especially effective immediately after meals.The salt helps to kill off bad bacteria in the mouth. This makes the area cleaner and lowers the possibility of infection. It also has healing properties that may help the wound to heal faster.
 Mix equal parts hydrogen peroxide (3%) and water in a glass. Swish this mixture in your mouth for 15 to 20 seconds and the spit it out. Be careful not to swallow. You can repeat this process up to four times daily.Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful antiseptic which will help to control bacterial activity in your wound. It will also act as a cleansing agent by removing debris from the cut and delivering a constant quantity of oxygen to the cells, which also helps to stop the bleeding.
It also comes in a gel form that you can apply directly to your cut using a clean cotton swab.
 Take one part diphenhydramine, like Benadryl allergy liquid, and one part of an antacid, like milk of magnesia, and mix it together. Swish this mixture in your mouth for a minute and then spit it out. You can do this once or twice a day.


Antacids control the acid levels in the mouth which promotes healing. An antihistamine will lessen the inflammation. Combining these medicines creates what some people refer to as a “miracle mouthwash.”If you don’t feel comfortable swishing the mixture, you can also make the solution a bit thicker and apply it as a paste.
 Benzydamine hydrochloride, 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate, or just your standard mouthwash are all good options. Take the suggested amount into your mouth and swish it around for 15 to 30 seconds. Spit the liquid out. Repeat this process after eating. This will help to keep your wound clear of food particles, which also promotes healing by preventing infection.

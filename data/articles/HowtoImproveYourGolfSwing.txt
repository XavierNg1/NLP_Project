 This is the internet age! There are very reputable forums and instructors on the internet who are giving valuable content online not for fame but rather for the enjoyment of teaching and the thrill of seeing amateur players enjoy the game. Now more than anytime before you can learn golf online via videos, e-books, forums, etc. You have to invest some time and effort into improving your golf swing outside of just swinging your clubs or hitting golf balls at a range.;
, Many people have gone before you that have the exact same areas in their golf game that is lacking as you. If something is missing in your swing, find out these instructors' take on that element. If you're looking for a complete overhaul, you can easily find their take on the key elements to the golf swing. Do some searching and some reading on the areas of your game you'd like to improve.
 It is imperative that you understand why it is what you're doing. If you're slicing the ball and someone recommends that you "strengthen your grip" then you should definitely understand what this is and why it is supposed to work. Only then will you empower yourself to improve your golf swing.
 It could take weeks or months of practice before you are able to ingrain a change into your swing. This is an area where people give up too soon. Don't give up if while practicing you hit the first dozen balls terribly. It takes time to make a change. Just remember that you're investing in your future golf swing.

 Before you go on a semester abroad you should make a budget for the amount of money you have and how long you will be gone. Making a budget requires that you have a general understanding of costs in the country you are going to and that you know what will, and won't, be covered by the tuition costs you pay upfront.


When making a budget it is a good idea to leave a little bit of wiggle room by allocating emergency funds, if you can. If you budget down to the last penny, you may end up with unexpected costs that you can't cover.
 In many cases, you will be able to live on less than you do at home. This is especially true if you are doing a study abroad program in a smaller city or a country with a low cost of living. If you are coming from a country that has a high standard of living and the money has a high value, then you may be able to live on less when you are abroad.However, the opposite can be true as well. If you are used to a low cost of living and you are going to a place with a high cost of living, such as London, then you will need to take that into consideration. Your money will not go as far as it would at home.
One thing to do while preparing for your trip is to look at the exchange rate for currency between your home and where you are visiting. If your currency is strong compared to the currency you are exchanging for, then it will help you financially while you travel because your money will go further., Making changes to your individual habits, preferences, and travel choices while you are abroad can dramatically decrease the cost of living abroad. Consider abandoning your normal luxuries while you are abroad and instead try to live frugally.


For example, this could include avoiding buying new clothes or accessories, eating homemade food more often, or traveling via the cheapest methods.
If you cut down on your costs, then you can cut down on your need to make money while abroad.

 Mediation is designed to allow parties to resolve their disputes amicably and spare the time and expense of a formal court proceeding.


You and the insurance adjuster will sit down with a neutral third party. The costs of mediation usually are split between you and the insurance company.Mediation may have the most benefit when negotiations with the insurance adjuster have reached a stalemate and you feel like your only other option would be to file a lawsuit in court., The format varies, but typically you will be given at least one opportunity to talk to the mediator alone, and then will interact with the insurance adjuster while the mediator facilitates your communication.You don't need any documents or witnesses other than what you've already made available to the insurance adjuster.Even though mediation proceedings are informal compared to court procedures, with simpler rules, you should still consider hiring an attorney to help guide you through the process. You won't have to pay your attorney anything up front; instead, she'll take a percentage of whatever settlement you accept., If the claim is relatively simple, the mediator should be able to help you and the insurance adjuster meet in the middle within a few hours., Once you and the adjuster have come to an agreement, the mediator will ensure the terms of the settlement are put in writing for you to read.


If you have any questions about the terms, the mediator may be able to explain them or get the insurance adjuster to explain them, but the mediator is not your attorney and cannot offer you advice on whether you should accept a given term.
 Although you probably won't receive a check right there at the mediation, you should get one in the mail within a few days after you sign the settlement paperwork.


If you hired a lawyer, the check will go to her. She'll take her percentage, then write you a check for the rest of the settlement proceeds.

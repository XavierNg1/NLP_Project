Fresh sirloin steak is deep red in color, with a generous marbling of fat. This marbling is what makes steak succulent.
There should be a band of white fat around the outside of the steak.;
, Run the steak under cool water on both sides, then pat dry thoroughly using paper towels.
 Good steak doesn't require much seasoning. Salt and pepper sprinkled liberally on both sides is sufficient.


Add garlic powder, cayenne pepper, chili powder, or Italian spices for variations.
 Top sirloin steak is a great meat to marinate, since it pairs well with many flavors.


Choose your favorite marinade from the store, or mix up your own with equal parts oil, vinegar and spices.
Place the steak in a sealable plastic bag and add the marinade. Seal the bag and allow the steak to marinate for 4 hours or overnight.
When you're ready to cook the steak, remove it from the bag, pat it dry with paper towels, and proceed to the next step.
 Cooking a cold steak will make it more difficult to achieve the "doneness" you desire. Room temperature steaks are easier to bring to rare, medium rare, medium well, and well done specifications.

 Run a couple gallons of lukewarm water into a sink or bucket. Since you’ll be working with bleach, you’ll need a higher concentration of water than you would when cleaning with vinegar. Make sure there’s nothing in your work area that might be damaged by spilled bleach.


Bleach will need to be used to clean humidifier filters with extensive mold or mildewing.Avoid using hot water, as steam can cause the release of bleach fumes., You’ll only need to use about a teaspoon of bleach for every gallon of water. This will sufficiently dilute the bleach so that it can be used as an effective yet non-harmful cleaning agent. Be careful not to overdo it—too much bleach may eat right through a plastic filter.When handling bleach, always wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated area. If possible, equip a respirator and eye protection.Avoid coming into contact with the bleach solution with bare skin.
 Dunk the dirty filter into the solution and make sure it’s fully submerged. Bleach has potent cleaning and sterilizing properties, so no scrubbing is necessary. After a short soak, your humidifier filter will look as good as new.If there’s any mold, mildew or mineral deposits remaining after the initial soak, mix up a fresh batch of solution and soak the filter for another 10 minutes., Carefully remove the now-clean filter from the bleach solution and rinse it under warm water. Turn the filter slowly and aim the stream so that it flows through the filter from every angle. This will ensure that it comes out free of both mold and bleach. Air dry the filter, then return it to the humidifier.You can also make sure the filter has been properly rinsed by swishing it through a sinkful of clean water.
It’s important that you wash away every remaining trace of bleach, or it could be released into the air when you operate your humidifier again.

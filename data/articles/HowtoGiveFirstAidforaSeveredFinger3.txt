 Lightly wash off the finger to clean off dirt, especially if the wound on it looks dirty.Have someone else do these steps if you are still applying pressure.
 If possible, gently take off any rings or other jewelry. They may be more difficult to take off later., Lightly wet a clean paper towel with sterile saline solution if available (contact lens solution can be used), or tap or bottled water if saline is not available. Wring out any excess liquid. Wrap the finger in the towel., Set the wrapped finger in a zip-top bag. Zip up the bag., In a larger zip-top bag or a bucket, add ice and water. Place the zipped finger bag into the larger bag.Do not place the finger directly in water or ice, as it will get frostbitten and damage the skin. Also, don't use dry ice, as that is too cold., Once help arrives, let them take control of the finger.

 If youâ€™re nervous about trying this bold look, start with something small. Instead of putting it directly on your cheeks, start by applying yellow eyeshadow just under your lower lids when you wear yellow eyeshadow. This can get you used to the look before you put it on your cheeks.
 You can apply as much or as little yellow blush as you want. You can make it light for a gentle highlight, or you can apply thicker layers to build a bold, daring look. Experiment with both to determine what works for you.
 This is a bold makeup choice and may not be for everyone. If you decide to wear yellow blush, be confident and have fun with it. You may get some strange looks, but remember you are on the cutting edge of makeup fashion.

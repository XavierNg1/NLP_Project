 You can download everything you need to get started with Python from the Python website (python.org/downloads. The website should automatically detect that you're using Windows and present the links to the Windows installer.;
, There are currently two versions of Python available: 3.x.x and 2.7.10. Python makes both available to download, but new users should choose the 3.x.x version. Download the 2.7.10 if you are going to be working with legacy Python code or with programs and libraries that haven't adopted 3.x.x yet.


This guide will assume you are installing 3.x.x.
 Clicking the button for the version you want will download the installer for it. Run this installer after it has finished downloading.
 This will allow you to run Python directly from the Command Prompt.
 This will install Python with all of its default settings, which should be fine for most users.


If you want to disable certain functions, change the installation directory, or install the debugger, click "Customize installation" instead and then check or uncheck the boxes.
 To verify that Python is installed and working correctly, open the newly-installed interpreter. Click the Start button and type "python" to quickly open it.
 Python will open to a command line. Type the following command and press â†µ Enter to display "Hello world!" on the screen:





print('Hello world!')




, Python comes with a development environment called IDLE. This allows you to run, test, and debug scripts. You can quickly launch IDLE by opening the Start menu and searching for "idle".
 Now that you've verified that Python is installed and working, you can start learning how to use it. See How to Start Programming in Python for some tips on learning how to use Python.

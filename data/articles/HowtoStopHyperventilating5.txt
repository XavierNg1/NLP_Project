 Before you can help someone during an episode of hyperventilation you will need to assess his condition. Generally, the signs will be apparent; however, you will need to be sure that he is in fact hyperventilating in order to help him properly.Hyperventilation will usually be characterized by very fast, shallow, chest level breathing.
The person will generally appear to be in a state of panic.
Speech will be difficult for the person.
Muscle spasms in the person's hands may be visible.
 If you think someone is hyperventilating you can help by offering your reassurance that she is going to be fine. Often times hyperventilating can cause even more panic during a panic attack, resulting in an increasing cycle and worsening symptoms. Calm reassurance can help lower the amount of panic the person is feeling and restore normal breathing rates.Remind her that she is having a panic attack and that she is not experiencing something life-threatening, such as a heart attack.
Keep your tone calm, relaxed, and gentle.
Let her know that you are there with her and are not going to leave her.
 During an episode of hyperventilation, carbon-dioxide levels fall in the body and can cause symptoms typically associated with hyperventilating. In order to retain carbon-dioxide in the body, have the person breathe using the following methods:Have him purse his lips, exhaling and inhaling through them.
He may also try closing the mouth and one nostril. Have him breath in and out only through one open nostril.
If the person appears in distress, turns blue, or complains of any pain, then emergency services should be contacted for evaluation in the ER.

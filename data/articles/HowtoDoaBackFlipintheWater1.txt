 Make sure to be far enough from the top of the water that you can rotate all the way without your legs or arms coming out of the water. This isn't necessary for the flip, but the effect is somewhat diminished if the whole flip isn't completed underwater.;
, Your back should be perpendicular to the bottom of the pool. Since the force which will generate the flip will come all from your arms, curl your legs to stop them from providing resistance or coming out of the water., Have your palms facing down. You'll use your arms in a sort of doggy paddle to propel yourself in a flip. As you move in the flip, try to keep your arms at your side and parallel to your body, moving them together.
 To initiate the flip, tilt your head back and and start arching your back. Paddle as though you're trying to lay flat, parallel to the surface. Keep your legs curled as you move, and be sure to follow your back/head with your upper arms., Once your back is parallel to the surface, paddle with your arms and arch your head and back to keep flipping. Next is to be perpendicular to the water's surface, head facing the bottom of the pool., Once upside-down in the water, you can extend your arms towards the bottom of the pool for more resistance and leverage. Face your palms forward, and push with your arms until they form a right angle with your body. You should once again have your back parallel to the bottom of the pool, but with your head facing the surface of the water.
 To avoid them coming out of the water, move your arms to side (like a breast stroke) and push down towards the bottom of the pool to right yourself. You should finish in the same position you started in, back straight and perpendicular to the surface of the water.

 You remember that fantastic dream of yours, where the world and the people in it dissolved into one another, blending impressions with memories and things you thought you would never dream of but still did? And that day when you were in a fever and things seemed uncannily present and still distant. OK, it was marvelous but now you only remember fragments of it´s splendor. Here´s how to make use of those experiences in writing.
 In these few minutes, sit down with your weapon of choice (pen and paper, computer, dictaphone, etc). Try to be as perceptive as possible. Write everything you perceive, quickly: sounds, words, motion, animals passing, planes crashing, flowers in pots growing. Avoid thoughts about the perceptions to get a focus on the events and the objects, not on your processing of it. "A red car passing. Clock ticking. Steve, Steve! A man's voice. Doorknob. Black chairs stacked. What can I do for you today? A magpie. Two more magpies. Magpies taking off. Sunshine. Elderly couple passing. Checking account.... OK, you get the picture. Don't edit!

, This readiness is a powerful tool. Don't edit!

, Whenever that strange mindstream appears: in a fever, a dream, an unintended delay on a travel, make notes as objectively as possible. Don't edit!

, A lot. And again and again.
 Your readiness for writing objectively will show you the world.

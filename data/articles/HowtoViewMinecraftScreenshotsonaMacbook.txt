, Click the options button and then click "Resource Packs..." (left hand side above "Done.")

, Then click "Open resource pack folder." It will come up blank, with no files, if you have no Resource Packs.
 To do so, go up to the corner where you X out, minimize the window, or make it full-screen. Look down at the left and right arrow buttons, then roll your mouse over to the right. There should be a set of 4 buttons there. The one that is selected is dark gray.


Your default view should be the button with four little boxes in it. Go to the right, not to the button with horizontal lines, but to the button with a 3-column box. Click the 3-column box button. It should change from white to dark gray once it is selected.
 The resource packs folder should be selected. Go down two files and you should see a screenshots folder.
 Select any one to display the screenshot all the way to the right of the window.

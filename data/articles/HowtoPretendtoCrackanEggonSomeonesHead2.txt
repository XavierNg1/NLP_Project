 If your hands are cold, they will feel more like a refrigerated egg and the cold yolk and whites on your friend's head.


Dry your hands but don't give them a chance to warm up.
 Make sure there's nothing reflective in front of him (like glass or a mirror) that would allow him to see what you're doing.


You can also do this prank without giving the person as much notice that you're going to do something to them--approach your friend from behind while she's sitting at the lunch table, or sneak up on your sibling while he's doing his homework.
If the person is taller than you, they need to be sitting for this prank to work.
 If there are other people around, you can ask them "Do you guys dare me to crack an egg on his head?" If you want to let them in on the joke, try winking. Otherwise, keep your hands behind your back so they can't see that you don't really have an egg.
 Hold your hand so that the tips of all your fingers and your thumb are bunched together and touching. It should almost look like an invisible egg is in your hand. Your hand should be pointing down, so the tips of your fingers are touching your friend's head.


You want to try to mimic the weight of an egg, so don't rest your hand too heavily on your friend's head.
You can also try holding your hand in a loose fist, with the side of your hand resting on your friend's head. Your thumb should be facing up.
 As soon as you hit your egg hand, make it collapse on your friend's head. Your fingers should open up and splay out.


You can make a "krick!" sound with your mouth to make it sound like a cracking egg.
Don't hit your hand too hard or you might hurt your friend!

, Try to imitate the way it would ooze down over their head. Wiggle your fingers a little.

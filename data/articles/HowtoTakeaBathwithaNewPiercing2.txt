 Clean the bath thoroughly first. Disinfectant and a very good rinse. Repeat this step every single time you bathe with a new piercing., Very hot water will cause your piercing to swell and hurt., If not possible, do everything you can to keep the piercing well clear of the water. Make sure a minimum amount of contact occurs between the piercing and the water.,

Do not allow any soap, shampoo, conditioner or any other chemicals to get on the piercing.
Do not touch, pull, tug, brush against, wash over, scrub around or near the piercing whilst you are in the water.
 Then immediately rinse the wound out with sea salt water (one pinch in an eggcup of boiled and cooled water is about right) or tea tree oil. Ideally both. The purpose of this is to rinse out any bacteria, or soaps that might have snuck in there, and it is absolutely critically important that you do this as soon as you are out of the water.,

 Because many houseplant enthusiasts grow African Violets as part of their collection, they are usually easy to find.


Decide which color you prefer, or try growing different varieties of African Violets.;

Make sure the light is slightly filtered or not direct during the spring through autumn months so it does not damage or dry out the plants. In the winter months, place your African Violets in direct sunlight to be sure they get enough natural light each day.
 The best watering method is to place the pots in a saucer of water to allow for steady watering and maintain a vital humidity level around the plants.
 and then pour off the excess water. It will have absorbed what it needs by then and you can be sure you will not have over-watered.


If you decide to water your plants from the top, be careful not to get moisture on the leaves as this will damage them.
 1/4 to 1/8th tsp of fertilizer per gallon of water. 20-20-20 general fertilizer or a fertilizer with a higher middle number. Don't use the "super bloom" fertilizers as they can burn the plants.
 These small, new stems can grow large and make the plants misshapen and uneven in appearance.
 The plants experience a dormant phase so cutting back on water and heat will help them thrive when winter is over.
 Twice a year for standards (large ones) and once every 3 to 4 months for small ones. Leach the soil between time every 4th watering. (Pour water through the top of the soil without touching the leaves until the water runs through clear or almost clear.)


The rule of thumb for potting is make the pot 1/3 the size of the diameter of the plant. Small violets will never go in a bigger than 2 1/2" pot. Break the leaves back to only 3 or 4 main rows of leaves on the small ones so they will fit and bury the "neck" or cut the roots off and bury the neck depending on how long the neck is.
 You might consider using more perlite if you use a self watering pot or are in a damper climate.

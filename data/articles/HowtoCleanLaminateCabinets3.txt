 Mix together 1 Tablespoon (14.7 ml) of baking soda with 1 Tablespoon (14.7 ml) of vinegar to make a thick paste. (Add a bit more more liquid or powder as needed to create a consistency similar to peanut butter). Grab a clean wash cloth, rinse it with warm water, and wring out completely. Then use your washcloth to pick up some of the paste., Dab the paste onto any location with stuck on food or stains. Allow the paste to sit for 3-5 minutes. Then scrub these spots using a soft-bristle brush until the food/stains are gone.If you do not have a soft-bristled brush, you can use a damp washcloth or the textured side of a kitchen sponge.
 Wipe down any places where paste was applied with a clean washcloth and warm water. Be sure to remove any remaining paste. Dry using a soft cloth or towel.

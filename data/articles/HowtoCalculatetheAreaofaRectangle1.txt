 The rectangle is a quadrilateral, which means it has four sides. Its opposite sides are equal in length, so the sides along its length are equal, and the sides along its width are equal as well. If one side of the rectangle is 10, for example, then the opposite side's length will also be 10.


Also, every square is a rectangle, but not all rectangles are squares. So treat squares like rectangles in terms of finding its area.;
, The equation for finding the area of a rectangle is simply A = L * W. This means that the area is equal to the length of the rectangle times its width.

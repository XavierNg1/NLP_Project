 Consider making the words into a theme, especially if these coasters are intended for gifts. Some theme ideas could include:









Food (such as bake, dish, fish, etc.)
Automotive (such as Ford, Audi, fuel, etc.)
Computers (such as tech, disk, hack, etc.)
Non-physical words (such as love, care, dear, etc.).;
, In a standard board game, there are 100 letter tiles.









1 tile of each: J, K, Q, X, and Z
2 tiles of each: Blank, B, C, F, H, M, P, V, W, and Y
3 tiles of each: G
4 tiles of each: D, L, S, U
6 tiles of each: N, R, and T
8 tiles of each: O
9 tiles of each: A and I
12 tiles of each: E

, Research on websites, such as eBay, Craigslist, and the like, so that you can easily find collections of letters instead of relying on using an actual game set.
 Put each word under one another until a square is formed.
 Allow a few seconds for each letter to dry before applying a new letter on.









Start with the first letter of the first word.
Apply a thin layer of super glue on the right edge of it.
Add the second letter of the first word on it.
, Use the glued letter square as your "size pattern" by laying it on top of the cork.
 Use an X-Acto knife to "draw" a square around the border of the square letters and then finalize a cut-out.
 Connect the letter board and cork by using a glue gun.
 You can place a heavy object on top of the letters to ensure the two items are secured together.
 Use Mod Podge or another similar product that protects the letters from water or any moisture.









Spray products are recommended over paint-appliers because there are no streaks shown when it dries.
 Leave the coasters untouched for about a day for the sealer to completely dry. The last thing you want are fingerprints on it.
 Stack about four of the coasters on top of each other and wrap them with ribbon.
 The coasters are now ready for use or for giving as gifts.

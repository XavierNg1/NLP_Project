 If you are visiting a brewery or even a brewpub, then you are often encouraged to sample a beer before you decide to get a pint. If you are trying to choose between a few different IPAs or if you are not sure if you would like the brewery’s IPA, then ask the bartender for a sample.


Try saying something like, “I want to try this IPA before I decide what to order. Can I please have a sample?”

, After you get your sample, hold it up and take a look at it. This will give you a chance to see its color. Most IPAs have a deep golden color to them, but the color can vary in shades. Enjoying the appearance of the IPA is all part of savoring its flavor.Try to describe the appearance for yourself. What colors do you see in the glass? Is it golden? Amber? Pale orange? Is there any foam (head) on top of the beer? Is so, how much?

, Next, swirl the glass gently to help release some of the aroma of the beer. Then, bring it to your nose and inhale the aroma through your nose. This will enhance the flavor of the beer when you taste it and it will also provide a nice preview of the flavor.Pay special attention to the scent of the beer. What do you smell? Is it herbal? Floral? Citrusy? Is the aroma pleasant to you?

, After you have finished enjoying the aroma, you can taste the IPA and decide if you like it or not. Take a sip of the beer and hold it in your mouth for a minute. This will give you a chance to enjoy the flavors and the feel of the beer in your mouth.Note the taste of the IPA. What do you taste? Is it citrusy? Bitter? Sweet? Sour? Malty? Do you like the way it tastes?
If you like the IPA, then go ahead and order a pint to enjoy. However, if you do not like it, ask to try something else. IPAs can have a strong flavor, which is not for everyone. Make sure that you order something that you will enjoy drinking.

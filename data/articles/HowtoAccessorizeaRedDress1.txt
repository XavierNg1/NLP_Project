 Best kind would be one of the stretchy ones so it doesn't look like the belt should go on pants. Belts definitely classy the dress and show off the good curves.;
, A bright red can look overwhelming if you use it in every part of your outfit. Instead, use different shades of red to create contrast while staying within an all-red color scheme.
 This shade is deep enough to mimic the classic look of black, but offers a subtle hint of color to your feet.
 If you have a bold personality, opt for a bold shoe. Shiny patent leather adds a trace of shimmer to your foot, which may prevent your red shoe from being obscured by your red dress.
 Think rubies or garnets. Gunmetal settings create a tough look, while silver and gold settings have classic appeal.
 Post earrings, bracelets, and rings do not overlap with your dress and can be admired on their own. Necklaces and long dangle earrings may brush your dress, and the red stones may blend in with the red fabric.
 Even though you can have an ensemble with multiple red pieces, you should still keep things toned down. A large red bag may wash you out with too much red. Instead, go for a small red clutch, especially one in a shade that varies from your dress.
 Too many red accessories can confuse the eye. Restrict your jewelry to one or two small pieces, and avoid any accessory that looks unnecessarily large.

 Use a sturdy Y-shaped vegetable peeler to remove the thick skin.Cut off 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) from both ends of the pumpkin using a serrated knife.
Tip the pumpkin onto one side and grasp it firmly with one hand.
With your other hand, remove the outermost layer of skin with a Y-shaped peeler.
 Use a serrated knife to cut the raw flesh of the pumpkin into 2-inch (5-cm) chunks.


Divide the pumpkin in half lengthwise.
Scoop out the seeds and stringy pulp with a metal spoon. A serrated spoon works best.
Cut the remaining flesh into 2-inch (5-cm) cubes using a serrated knife.
Serrated knives are more effective because they dig into the thick flesh of the pumpkin more easily than smooth blades.
 Place the chunks inside a large saucepan and fill the saucepan with enough water to cover the pumpkin completely.


The pumpkin chunks should fill roughly half of the saucepan.
You only need the water level to be 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) above the pumpkin pieces.
 This should take approximately 25 minutes.


The pumpkin is tender when the pieces are soft enough to pierce with a fork.
Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat.
Leave the saucepan uncovered as you cook the pumpkin.
 Remove the pumpkin from the water, drain, and puree the flesh.


Pour the contents of the saucepan through a colander. Let the pieces sit in the colander for 15 to 25 minutes, draining and cooling simultaneously.
Puree the cooked chunks of pumpkin with a blender or handheld blender. You could also mash the chunks with a potato masher or food mill, or leave the pumpkin as cooked chunks when storing.

Make 4 bedrooms for your sims; have 2 sims per room.






Add a kitchen, dining room, and living room. 3. add a training area so put in tons of exercise equipment 4. in the backyard area put in a pool, a pond, a garden area and whatever else may help you sims gain skills such as a bookcase. (adding a training area can practically make the game more interesting and more realistic)

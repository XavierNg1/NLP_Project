 There are an array (no pun intended) of choices to choose from that are compatible with JavaScript code NetBeans, NotePad++, Visual Studio Code etc. Also, available are online IDEs such as Codenvy, and SourceKit. The plus side to online IDEs are you don't have to worry about platform compatibility.;
, JavaScript is a programming language that is mostly found interlace within HTML code. So, lets start there, HTML code begins with the declaration of the doctype at the top of the file. Followed by a HTML tag which encompasses the HTML document and a body tag which will display what is to be seen on the client-side of the browser.


In this instance, the code uses a p tag, where the "p" stands for paragraph. JavaScript allows the p tag to be looked at as an element along with the use of the ID attribute which defines the element further.
Next, using the script tag tells the browser where the scripting code will reside it can either be implement within the tags or externally. This is where the array code will be written.
 Arrays are used to store multiple values. Let's write some code that will store an array of colors.


The name of the colors are wrapped in quotes which tells the JavaScript code that these are strings and the commas separate the strings from one another. The brackets are used to place a border around the context of the array.
 Here, the ID attribute comes back into play by using "document", which is used to write information to the browser screen into a HTML element.


JavaScript also has a function called getElementById which does as the function states retrieves an ID element.
Also, adding the property innerHTML either retrieves or replaces the element.
 Gives the exact amount of values within the array.

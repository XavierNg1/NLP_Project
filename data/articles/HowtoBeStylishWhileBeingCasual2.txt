 Make things easy for yourself when you’re trying to pair one piece of clothing with another. Buy lots of clothing in neutral colors so just about everything you own will match each other.Perfectly neutral colors include white, black, and gray.More earthy tones include camel, cream, brown, gold, navy blue, olive, and silver.
 If you have a favorite color that you want to be known for, buy several articles in different shades. Or, if you’re less picky, buy a variety of bolder colors. Then perk your otherwise neutral outfits up with one of these articles, like wearing a bold red shirt with navy blue jeans and a black leather jacket.In addition to clothes, you can also accent your outfits with accessories like:Ties
Belts
Jewelry
Suspenders
Purses and bags

, If you find neutrals too boring, go ahead and dress in something bolder. Just make sure one element of your outfit doesn’t clash with another. Be aware that even though you personally like two different colors, people are hardwired to look for harmony in colors.When you assemble an outfit, start with one article as your base color and pair other items that match.

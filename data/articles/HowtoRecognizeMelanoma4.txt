 If a sore or pimple isn’t improving or continues to reappear in the same location, then it’s time to see a doctor. Your melanoma may look like a regular pimple or damaged skin, but you’ll notice that it doesn’t respond to typical treatment products., Melanomas sometimes look like the color is bleeding out from the mole into the other skin. For example, a red mole may have a pink area around it, or a dark brown mole may be surrounded by light brown skin.Also look for a purplish blue color in the blemish or mole., You may notice that one or more of your moles looks puffy or irritated, similar to a bug bite. This swelling is a symptom of a melanoma, so you should get that mole checked.

The swelling could be minute rather than a lump, so don’t dismiss a slightly raised area.
The redness could be pink rather than a dark red., A melanoma will feel different from a normal mole. Use your fingers to feel your moles and the area around them to see if they feel sore or hurt. If a mole begins to itch, make a note of it. Keep track of how often it itches. If you notice the issue continuing for a few days, make an appointment with your doctor., The skin over your mole may undergo changes, even if the size and color stay the same. Your skin may feel scaly or develop a bump. You may also notice oozing or bleeding on your mole.

 Quality time with your parents, children, relatives, and spouse can have a lasting impact on their overall physical and mental health. Our busy lives often get in the way of developing connections and spending needed time with family and friends. Here are some ways spend quality time:


Have dinner around a dinner table, rather than in front of the TV, so that you have more time to connect.
Go on road trips, sightsee, or share new experiences together.
Visit relatives that you don't see as often or make time to call or write them.;
, Make that day special, and be present in all ways possible, physically and mentally. Participate in the interests of your family. By remembering the things that matter to them most, you can build a stronger bond with your loved ones.


Keep a calendar and mark down any special days ahead of time, so you don't forget things like game days, dance rehearsal, or anniversaries. By keeping a schedule, you'll be better able to prioritize it.
 While it's important to make time for your family, your friends are like your second family. Make sure that not all your time is consumed by one person or thing. Friends can help to keep things in perspective.


Have coffee or tea with friends, and see what going on in their lives.
Meet up with a friend regularly. Don't let school work, your job, or your daily chores consume you so that all you do is text or email them. Connecting in person, rather than online or by phone, can have a lasting impact.
 While many social activities are done in groups, like family gatherings or outings with friends, it's important to build closer relationships with people, and really get to know how they're doing. This is particularly true with a sibling or friend who is going through a tough time.


Set aside time to make them feel special. Showing empathy is part of being "present in the moment."

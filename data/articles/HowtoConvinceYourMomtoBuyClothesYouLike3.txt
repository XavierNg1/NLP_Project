 Do your chores, finish your homework, and keep your grades up in school. Show your mom that you’re responsible. Do what she expects you to do without having to be told. Then go the extra mile and help around the house with things she didn’t even ask you to do. Prove to her that you’re mature and deserve to be taken seriously when you ask for things., If your mom already seems stressed out, wait for another time. Catch her in a good mood, when she’s relaxed and more willing to actually consider what you want. Don’t blow your chance by asking her for stuff when she’s already grumpy about something else., Make your mom feel like she’s appreciated and not just an ATM. Show her that you’re thankful for what she’s already done for you before asking her for anything more. If she’s already bought you something special recently, or if you know she has a big bill to pay or something like that, let her know that you think about these things. Don’t just say, “Hey, Mom, can you get me this?” Instead, ask her if she has a minute. If she does, tell her that you know she has bills to pay, or you know she already bought you that other special thing, but if it’s possible, could she maybe also get you this?, Before you ask for something, tell her that she doesn’t have to answer right away. Let her know what you’d like from her, and then ask her to think it over, for as long as she needs. Don’t demand an instant answer; if you do, she’s more likely to say “no” right away, even if she isn’t sure why, just because she doesn’t have time to think it through., If your mom says no, nod your head and say okay. Remember: you could still convince her to change her mind later, but she’ll be less likely to if you throw a tantrum now. Instead, respect her decision. Show her that you take her seriously. This way she’ll take you more seriously, too, so when you ask her again later, she’ll really think about it instead of just repeating “no.”

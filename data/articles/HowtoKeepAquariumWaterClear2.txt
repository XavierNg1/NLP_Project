 A good rule of thumb is to change 20% of the water in the tank every week. If you use tap water, let it sit for two days. This allows it to reach room temperature plus allow the chlorine in it to dissipate, which helps the water not shock the fish when it is poured into the tank.You can also buy a device that hooks to your faucet that vacuums the gravel while removing and replacing water. You don’t have to wait a few days if doing it this way. Just make sure you make sure the temperature is close to your tank’s temperature and that you add in a chlorine remover., You must keep your filter up and running. The filter helps keep your tank healthy and prosperous, so not changing it or neglecting it can lead to cloudy water or even fish death. Read the instructions for your filter to know how to take care of it.All filters need to be examined monthly and changed if needed.Check them weekly for any blockages or build up. Clean or replace as needed.
Read the instruction manual that came with your pump to make certain it is properly installed and working as it should. The pump is important in aerating the aquarium with oxygen from the air. If it is not working properly the fish will suffer especially if the water is cloudy from waste matter.
 Another way to try to clear up your water is to clean your tank regularly. You should set up a schedule to clean the tank at least once a month. This is in addition to the regularly scheduled water changing you should be doing at least once a week.

 Scroll down to find the appropriate case, and click “Escalate.”


You can only Escalate a case if it is at least a week old. This is to give the shop owner to respond before the case is considered more serious.
Once the case has been Escalated, the shop owner must resolve the case before selling on Etsy again. If the shop owner does not respond, they will no longer be able to sell on Etsy again.
 You may be required to provide additional information. Be sure to respond to these requests, or else your case may be closed.
 The seller will be notified that the case has been closed, and both of you will receive emails regarding the closed case.
 The process of filing for a refund will not be via Etsy. There is a limited time frame for filing claims, so make sure to be prompt.

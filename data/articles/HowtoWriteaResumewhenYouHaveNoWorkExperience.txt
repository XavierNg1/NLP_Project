 The job posting should give a list of traits and skills that the employer is seeking. Think long and hard about what they mean and how you fulfill them.

These might have alternative qualifications and skills that would be useful and could be highlighted in your resume.
Research the history and activities of the company to discern what unlisted skill sets might be important.

, In the cover letter you will want to make a sustained case for why you can perform the job better than other applicants. Your resume, on the other hand, is a relatively short, somewhat disconnected account of your qualifications. Your resume should be built to reinforce the argument of your cover letter, not the other way around.In your cover letter you should try to show why not having work experience is an asset, not a liability. Maybe you are young and ambitious. Perhaps you are coming from a different perspective that would help you approach the subject in a creative way.

Monster.com posts sample resumes by field, so that you can see how people in similar fields have crafted their resumes. On the other hand, Business Insider has a superb example of what a resume for a new entry into the workforce should look like.
 The first line of the resume, after a heading that lists the job position, should be an objective statement. The objective statement tells your employer about your long-term career goals. Properly done, it will also advertise your skills. Keep the statement to two sentences.Tailor your objective statement to the job you are applying for and use it to convey your qualifications even as you write about your goals: "Motivated and empathetic student of childhood development eager to enter the field of early childhood education. Interested in using communication skills and understanding of psychology to provide children with a firm foundation for their intellectual and emotional development in a fashion consistent with the reputation of a distinguished institution of learning.", You should always follow your objective statement with an “Education” section that lists your degrees and GPA. Consider additional sections if they are relevant. If you are applying directly out of college, feel free to cite your history all the way back to high school.Consider including sections like “Relevant College Coursework” and “Achievements and Awards.” In relevant college coursework, list only classes you took that have direct bearing on the job. You do not need to list individual grades for courses.
 You should include a section devoted to discussing skills relevant to the position. Label the section skills and place it before work experience. If possible, provide a more detailed description with each skill.In describing your skill you can discuss experience, including how you have exercised that skill in school, clubs, or your personal life. Or, if for example you are computer savvy and have experience with social media, discuss the media platforms you are familiar with or the computer programs you can use.
The skills section allows you to discuss experience you’ve had that would look flimsy in a section like “Work Experience.” You can say that you know about databases because you used them for a particularly large school project or that you have experience advertising via social media from running your own blog.
List languages that you are fluent in.
 With a heading like “Leadership Experience” mention any leadership roles you have had. This could be the vice presidency of a major school club. However, it could also be work you did as a camp counselor or as team leader in sports.
 Under work experience feel free to list any unpaid internship or volunteer experience that lasted at least three months. If you do not have any such experience, exclude the section altogether., You want your resume to look nice. It might be tempting to get artistic and try some creative fonts. However, adhering to traditional practices will make your resume look more professional.


Standard page margins of approximately one inch are typically best. If you do want to stand out and are struggling to fit all of your experience onto one page, you can consider 0.63 inch margins.
Times New Roman, 11 point font, is a good standard.
Use good, thick, white paper, 20-25 bond.
The only acceptable symbols to put on a resume are line breaks and bullet points. Avoid emoticons, emoji, and other unprofessional symbols., If you want your prospective employer to take you seriously, you should make sure that there are no typos in the resume. Verify that you aren’t changing your verb tense throughout. Your style should also be consistent and clear.

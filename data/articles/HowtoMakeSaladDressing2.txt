 In a small to medium mixing bowl, combine the three ingredients and rapidly whisk them together until the color and consistency are even throughout.


Make sure the color is even and solid. There should be no yellow or white streaks running through the mixture.
This dressing is simple enough to prepare by hand, so you do not need to use a food processor or bender.
 Sprinkle the poppy seeds over the surface of the dressing mixture and stir the mixture until the seeds are evenly distributed.


The flecks of poppy seed should be dispersed throughout the mixture.
 Sprinkle in the salt and pepper, adjusting the seasonings to taste, and stir the mixture well to distribute the seasonings evenly.
 You can use the dressing immediately, but if you made it ahead of time, place the poppy seed salad dressing in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator until ready to serve.


Store the dressing inside the refrigerator when not in use. It should stay fresh for a few days to a week.

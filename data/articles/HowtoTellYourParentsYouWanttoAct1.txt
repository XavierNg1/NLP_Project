 Brainstorm your answers, in other words write down everything that comes to mind, this is just for your benefit.;
,, Things like "It makes me happy" are great but try to ask yourself why it makes you happy. Write it down.
 Some reasons that are important to you, like "I have deep psychological need for approval and appearing on a stage can meet" may be a great reason (and is), but probably not the best bet for talking to your folks.

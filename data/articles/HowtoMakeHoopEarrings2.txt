 You can change the shape of the wire using a hammer and jeweler’s block. Try placing your hoop earring on a jeweler’s block and hammering the hoop to flatten it out.Don’t hammer to much or you may break the wire.
 You can leave your hoops as a classic circle, or you can experiment with other shapes. Use your pliers to bend and shape the wire into other interesting shapes.Try forming the wire into a square, triangle, octagon, or diamond.
 You can also use your pliers to change the look of your hoop earrings. Try using your round nose pliers to bend the wire in a few places and create a wavy effect. You can bend it just a little bit, or bend it into dramatic waves around the entire earring.

If you want to use this technique, then you may want to make your hoops a bit larger to provide slack for bending the wire.
 A simple way to embellish your hoop earrings is to slip some beads onto them. Try using colorful glass beads, crystal beads, or even wooden beads to add some extra flair to your earrings. Arrange the beads in a pattern to create a colorful set of hoop earrings.

 Old-fashioned licking is the most common method, as long as you don't have too many envelopes to seal. It can be cumbersome and inefficient if you're handling a large number of envelopes at once.


Contrary to urban legend, envelope glue is not toxic—it’s composed primarily of gum arabic, an ingredient found in a number of common foods. Even if you cut your tongue on the edge of the envelope, the glue won’t sneak in and kill you. ;
, Swipe your tongue carefully across the seal of the envelope.
 Fold the flap down, and then run your fingers over the top to set it in place. The wetness from your tongue will moisten the glue on the seal, allowing it to bond with the paper of the envelope when sealed.

 Although you may be looking for an antique appeal, make sure your springs have been relieved of all dust and debris. Use mild dish soap and a clean rag to wipe down each spring.
 Before you wire it together you’ll want to see how it will appear.


Start by placing one spring on a flat surface, large spring facing downward (on the surface).






Next to the first spring, place another spring, this time with the small spring on the surface and the large spring at the top.






Continue this as a pattern while creating a circular shape.
 Cut two to three pieces of wire to bind the springs to one another.


Wind one wire to join the top springs and one to join the bottom springs. Considering doubling up if the springs are made from a heavy material or if they aren’t holding together with just one on each side.






Continue winding the wire around the springs to join them together.



Add decors like gems, stones or ribbons.

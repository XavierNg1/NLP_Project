 There are many charities that assist homeless youth, but it’s important to find one that allocates its resources well and steers clear of political posturing or financial corruption. Research the charitable institution you plan on patronizing to make sure they have the best interests of homeless youth at the heart of everything they do.Well known organizations like Stand Up For Kids, Habitat for Humanity, or Housing Families have the experience needed to effectively make use of their donations. When in doubt, donate to a well respected institution.
Many charities offer the opportunity to sponsor a child. This method of donation can be particularly helpful as it allows a child the benefit of one patron they can look up to. Research sponsorship to see if it’s right for you.
 Not everyone can afford to write big checks to charities. Sometimes all it takes to make a difference is donating a few dollars a month or collecting canned goods to take to a food bank. There’s nothing wrong with giving generously, but make sure you’re staying with your own means and being financially responsible.


Another great way to give to homeless children is by donating clothes, diapers, shoes, and hygiene items. Donate hand-me-downs to a clothing drive or make a gift of new toothbrushes to a homeless youth center to increase a charity’s resources and their potential to help homeless children.
 Whatever method of donation you choose, it’s important to be consistent in your support. Make regular, incremental donations to a charity and you’ll begin to see the improvements brought about by your support.

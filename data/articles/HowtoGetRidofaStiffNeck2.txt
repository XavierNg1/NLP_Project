 In most cases, a stiff neck can be relieved immediately by performing a series of exercises to relieve tension caused by tight or strained neck muscles. Stretch the muscles in the front and back of your neck by tilting your chin toward your chest. Then bring your chin up toward the sky. Repeat for several minutes.


If this exercise feels painful, don't tilt your head too far forward or backward. Just try enough movement to feel a little stretch.
 Stretch the muscles in the sides of your neck by tilting your head toward one shoulder and then toward the other. Continue doing so until the pain eases a bit and the muscles feel less tense.
 This is often the most painful motion you can make when you have a stiff neck, so ease into it slowly. Keep turning your head from left to right for several minutes.
 For the first few days after you start getting a stiff neck, itâ€™s a good idea to decrease the amount of physical activity.This will help reduce symptoms and relieve some of the inflammation you may be experiencing. Avoid the following sports or exercises for the first 2 to 3 weeks after the stiff neck appears:


Football, rugby, hockey, or any other high-contact sports
Golf
Running or jogging
Weightlifting
Ballet
Sit-ups and leg lifts

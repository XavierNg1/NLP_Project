Pin the scarf along the edges, if necessary., Use a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance.Start sewing at the bottom of the second stripe, and stop sewing at the top of the second to last stripe. Do not sew across the narrow ends of the scarf.

Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing to keep the stitching from coming undone.

Focus on the side edges., Sew across the top of the first stripe, and the bottom of the last stripe. Use a thread and bobbin color that matches the fabric.

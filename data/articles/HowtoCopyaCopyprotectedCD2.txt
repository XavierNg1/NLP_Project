 While you can use the above method to rip the contents of an audio CD to your computer to be burned to a new CD, the process is a little different if you want to copy a data CD or make a 1:1 copy of your audio CD. To do this, you will need a disc copying program.


The most popular and powerful disc copying program is CloneCD. CloneCD is available for free for 21 days, which should allow you to copy any CD you need to without having to pay. You can always uninstall it and reinstall it if you want to restart the trial period.
 When you first start CloneCD, you will see four options. Select the first one to start the image creation process. This will copy the entire contents of the CD as a single file, which will then be able to be burned to a new disc.


In the next window, select the drive that contains the disc that you want to copy.
Choose the disc type. Once the disc has been analyzed, you will be given several options to choose from. Choose the type of content that is on the disc: CD Audio, Data, Multimedia Audio, Game or Protected Game.
Set a location for the image. Choose a location on your hard drive to store the image file. The image file will be as big as the CD is, which means it could be up to 800 MB large.
Wait for the image to be created. Once you set the location of the image file and continue, the image creation process will begin. This could take a significant amount of time. Avoid doing anything else on the computer during this process, as opening other programs could end up causing errors.
 Once the image has been created, you can burn it to a new blank CD. CloneCD has a burning function built-in, but you can use any image burning program, such as ImgBurn or Nero. See this guide for more details on burning image files to a disc.

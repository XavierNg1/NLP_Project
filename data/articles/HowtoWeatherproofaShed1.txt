 If you are building a new shed, it is important to build it on supports rather than directly on the ground. Use cinder blocks or other stone shed supports, or use treated wood to build a framework that keeps it off of the ground.Building the shed on supports keeps groundwater from soaking into it.
Your options are limited if your shed is already sitting directly on the ground. You could use heavy machinery to lift the shed and then add a support structure under the shed.
Most sheds installed by professionals are built up off of the ground.;
, Go to the hardware store and look in the paint aisle or speak to an employee. Choose an exterior paint that is specifically labelled as waterproof. Paint the entire exterior of the shed, including all four sides and the roof.This creates a water-repelling barrier so the water is not absorbed.
If you are painting in conjunction with felting the roof, paint the roof in between cleaning the roof and applying the new felt.
 Grab a caulking gun and some all-purpose, exterior caulk. Look carefully for gaps at the corners and edges of the shed. Check the walls and the ceiling for holes or spaces between boards. Fill any gaps that you find with caulk.

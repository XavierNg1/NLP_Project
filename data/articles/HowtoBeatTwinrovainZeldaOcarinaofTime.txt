 The Twinrova sisters circle around you slowly. Every once in a while, one stops to shoot either fire or ice at you, depending on the sister. Each of these attacks take a lot of damage, and together the Twinrova sisters make a formidable foe!;
, The trick to completing the first phase of the battle is to block an attack with the Mirror Shield back at the opposite sister (so if the fire sister shot fire at you, you would have to use use the Mirror Shield to hit the ice sister).


A good trick is to stand on the opposite side of the room of the attacking sister. Quickly target the other sister and block the attack with the Mirror Shield.
 Soon, the Twinrova sisters will combine into one form.
 The goal of this battle is to charge up your shield. When Twinrova shoots at you, block. Choose which element you want to charge your shield with, and if Twinrova shoots the opposite element, jump out of the way.
 Twinrova, once hit, will go down on one of the islands. Thankfully, if you have the Biggoron's Sword, you'll only have to make her go down twice (meaning you only have to hit her four times!). Soon she'll be defeated, and you can collect the Heart Container and step through the portal.

 Use your mouse or trackpad to position your cursor above the “x” on each browser tab. The “x” is located to the right of the tab icon and title.
 Right-click on a tab for more options. If you do not have a right mouse button, try control+click, or "two finger click" on a trackpad. Depending on your browser, some of these options will appear in a drop-down menu:


Close Other Tabs (Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari): Keeps the tab you clicked open, closes all others.
Close Tabs to the Right (Chrome, Firefox): Closes all tabs to the right of the one you clicked.
Close Tab Group (Internet Explorer 8+): Closes the tab you clicked and all tabs highlighted the same color. (Use "Ungroup this Tab" first if you want to keep one of these tabs open.)Close All but Active (Opera): Keeps the tab you're currently using open, closes all others.
Close All Private Tabs (Opera): Closes all tabs that were opened using the File → New Private Tab menu item.
 Make sure the tab you want to close is highlighted in your browser window. Use the following shortcuts:


For any browser in Windows or Linux, press Control ("Ctrl") W.
For any browser in Mac, press command W.For Internet Explorer and Firefox, if you have a middle mouse button, clicking a tab with it will close the tab.If your middle button is a wheel, press it downward; do not spin it.

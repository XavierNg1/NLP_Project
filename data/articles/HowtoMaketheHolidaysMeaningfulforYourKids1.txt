 Whether you celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa, you and your family can learn the meaning of the holiday. Read the origin story about the holiday or research where certain traditions come from.As you learn about the holiday, talk about it with your kids. Ask them questions and make sure they understand what they are learning.;
, Another way to make the holidays meaningful is to share holiday memories with each other. Ask your children what their favorite memories are and why. Share with them stories about past holidays. Make sure to include stories about family members they may not have met so they will know about their ancestors.If family members are no longer with you, spend time sharing memories about those you love. That keeps them with you and your family.
You may tell the same stories each year, but that’s okay. Sharing holiday stories each year is a great tradition.
 As the holidays get closer, you can get together with your kids or as a family and read holiday books. You can choose a new book or story each night, or read one every few nights.If you want to read a longer novel, get together and read a few chapters each night.
 There are lots of great kid-friendly holiday movies that you can enjoy with your kids. Try sitting down as a family to watch a movie once per week in the weeks leading up to the holidays.

Try introducing your kids to some of you favorite holiday movies, or watch holiday classics with them, such as Charlie Brown Christmas, Frosty the Snowman, and Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas.

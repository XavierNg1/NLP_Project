 If you have a dried blood stain on your mattress, apply a cornstarch paste to the surface to draw it out of the fabric. In a bowl, mix half a cup (250 ml) of cornstarch, one tablespoon of salt, and one quarter of a cup (125 ml) of hydrogen peroxide. Test the mixture on a small, hidden portion of your upholstery to see if discoloration occurs before using., Using a small spatula or spoon, apply a thick layer of the paste to the stain. Let the paste sit for 3-4 hours (or overnight) until it dries into a crust. If you have pets or children, do not leave the treated area unsupervised., When the mixture has dried, gently chip off as much of it as you can with a blunt spoon. Using a brush and dustpan, sweep away fragments of the dried mixture. Use a vacuum with a hose attachment to remove remaining bits of the cornstarch mixture that may have been embedded into the fabric.

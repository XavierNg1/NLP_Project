 You will better understand and expect where a vehicle would normally come from.;
, Ask yourself, "Is this vehicle really worth taking out?" It depends on what type of vehicle they're using and where the driver is located. For example, a manned Ghost roaming around the top surface of Snowbound may not really prove to be a major threat if everyone else is fighting underground.
 Execute this by moving to a narrow area, where the driver/pilot can't shoot or splatter you; in other words, where a vehicle can't fit. Make sure you either crouch or limit your movements. Then, use the radar to detect the vehicle's movements. The driver will most likely try to scope you out and come closer, if he/she is inexperienced.
 While the driver/pilot is unsure of your location, stick it with a plasma grenade or spike grenade. If those two grenades aren't available to you, quickly pop out and hijack the vehicle (if he/she is in range). The driver should be vulnerable at this point, leading to an easy kill. You could also stay behind a corner and hijack the vehicle if you wish to.

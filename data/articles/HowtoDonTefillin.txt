 There are two boxes; one goes on the left (or right for the left handed) arm called the 'shel yad', and the other goes on the head called the 'shel rosh'.;
, Unwind the strap and remove it from its case, taking care that it does not touch the floor. Put the case in a safe place.
 Roll up your sleeve of your weak arm to allow enough room for the shel yad to be placed directly on your skin.
 Place the shel yad on the upper portion of your weak arm at heart level with the box on the side of your inner elbow, but do not tighten the strap yet.
, Tighten the strap around your upper arm, then wind the straps seven times around the lower arm (between the elbow and wrist), with the black side of the straps facing outward. Customs vary as to which direction to wind them in, and if uncertain, one should ask their rabbi.
 Rest the bag and case in a safe place, along with the shel yad case.
 Rest the box evenly in the middle of the forehead, behind your original hairline even if you have since balded. Be sure the knot is in the back of the head in the exact opposite location, but do not yet tighten on your head. Don't worry about the straps yet.
, Then neatly straighten the straps and let them hang in front of you, black side facing outward.
, Wind it around the palm of the hand and the fingers. There are varying customs regarding winding patterns. If unsure, consult a rabbi.
 Afterwards, they are put away, undo the hand part first then take off the shel rosh and put it away then take off the rest of the shel yad. No blessings are recited as the tefillin are put away.

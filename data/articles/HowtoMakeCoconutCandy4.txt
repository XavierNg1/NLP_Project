 To make this traditional Nigerian dessert, you will need:


One fresh brown coconut
200g of confectioners' sugar (approximately 1 3/4 cups)

, Use a screwdriver to puncture holes in the eyes of the coconut and drain the coconut water, setting it aside for later.


Use a hammer to crack open the coconut, then use a butter knife to pry the meat from the shell. Use a fine grater to grate the coconut meat into long, thin strips. Make sure to grate along the meat, rather than across it.

Tip: You can make it easier to remove the coconut meat from the shell by baking the drained coconut in a 400 degree F oven for 10 minutes. Allow the coconut to become cool to the touch before cracking with the hammer.
 Place the coconut water, grated coconut and confectioners sugar into a saucepan and stir to combine. Add just enough water to cover the coconut mixture, then place a lid on the saucepan and set to a high heat., Once the coconut mixture starts to boil, remove the lid and stir continuously until most of the water evaporates. Reduce to a low heat and continue stirring while the sugar starts to caramelize., As the sugar caramelizes, the coconut mixture will start to stick together and the coconut pieces will turn brown.

Once this happens, take the saucepan off the heat and spoon the coconut mixture onto a plate. Be careful not to touch the coconut, as it will be extremely hot!
Once the coconut has cooled, you can serve it as a dessert or keep it for a sticky sweet snack.

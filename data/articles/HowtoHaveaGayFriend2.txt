 You shouldn't act any differently when trying to make a gay or lesbian friend than you would when making a straight friend. Don't worry about only talking about LGBT subjects. Gay and lesbian people like to talk about other things too. Make conversation about topics you care about, in hopes that you have something in common with your new potential friend.
 Gay and lesbian people are probably all around you, you just don't know it. Befriend people at work, in your church, at your gym, or at your salon. Your new friend may just be gay!

, You shouldn't expect to get a stereotypical friendship when befriending a gay man or lesbian. Instead, you should try to make a gay or lesbian friend because you want a really good friend that you have a lot in common with.


Forget about stereotypes. Gay and lesbian people lead a wide variety of lives and have a huge array of interests. Don't assume a gay man is going to be interested in fashion or a lesbian is automatically going to be interested in softball. These are stereotypes and they are not universally true.
 Attend LGBT events or volunteer for LGBT causes. Join a LGBT organization that wants straight members, such as a Gay/Straight alliance at your school.Do all you can to involve yourself in LGBT community. While you can probably meet gay or lesbian people in your day to day life, it will probably be easier if you put yourself out there and go to them.


If you are going to join LGBT causes, you need to really believe in the work you are doing. Don't just join to make friends. Join to make friends and make a difference in the lives of those you want to befriend.

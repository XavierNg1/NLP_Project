 If you wear your hair in ponytails, braids, or buns, gel can keep your hair sleek and easy to work with. Grasp the hair you plan to put in a holder (such as a clip or hairband). Apply the gel as described above, from the roots to where the holder will attach. Once the hair is sleek and tidy, with no stray hairs, put it through the holder. The hair should no lie smooth and secure for longer.


Spread the gel down the whole length of your hair before braiding, to avoid a messy frizz.
 After completing your bun, high puff, or other updo, apply a little gel to the edges of the hairstyle to help preserve the shape. Take care not to work your hair too hard, or you may flatten the hairstyle and undo your careful styling work.
 If you want to get your hair to form "cat ears" or another stick-straight-up style, you'll need more gel. Work it thoroughly into your hair as you style, so the gel permeates the whole style.

 This is as simple as just googling “Find hip-hop classes near me”. If you’ve heard people talking about their hip-hop classes, bring it up to them and ask where they got their start.
 Once you’ve committed to going to a class, don’t slack off. Will power must be exercised like any other muscle.It might help to reach out to the other members of your class. This way, if you ever miss class or don’t feel like going, they will be there to support you.
 Just going to class won’t be enough to make you an extraordinary dancer. Build your confidence by practicing your moves over and over again in the mirror.


If your classes only happen weekly, it’s totally possible to forget everything that happened in the previous week. To prevent this, you should write down what you learned when you get home after class. Throughout the week, look back at your notes and practice in the mirror.
 Share your new dancing skills with the world at large! Even if it pushes you out of your comfort zone, the point of dancing is that it’s a fun shared activity. Force yourself to show off everything you worked so hard for.


Maybe your class ends in a performance. This a good time to force you a little out of your comfort zone. After your performance, don’t treat your learning process like it’s over, though! Keep going out and dancing.

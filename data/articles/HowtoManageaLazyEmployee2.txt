 One of the most common factors that causes laziness is boredom. Though it seems counter-intuitive, an employee may be putting in less effort because they aren’t feeling stimulated. Get them excited about their job again by assigning tasks they’ve conveyed interest in, or that will challenge them in a different way.An employee that seems to be wasting time may simply be getting what they need to do done quickly, and may even be ready for greater responsibilities.
 If you’re generally happy with one of your employees but you know they could be getting more done, consider offering performance-based incentives to work harder. For instance, offer a slightly higher commission on sales beyond their regular quota, or a longer daily lunch break if they can get more done each morning., Maybe you have an employee who does their work, but never quite to the level of quality you’re hoping for. Don’t jump in and finish a task or tweak it to meet your standards. Point out the difference between what they’re doing and what needs to be done, and show them how to they can improve. If it helps, think of yourself as a coach, as opposed to the clean-up crew.Say something like, “Andrew, I’m glad to see you’ve kept up with this week’s assignments. I noticed a recurring roughness in your finished product though. Take the time to sand each piece thoroughly and they’ll be coming out beautifully.”

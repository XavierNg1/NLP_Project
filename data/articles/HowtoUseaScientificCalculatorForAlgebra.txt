 These operations include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).

You have to hit the equals (=) sign to complete a calculation using these symbols.

Use these functions the same way you would on a basic calculator. For example, to find 12/4, enter 12÷4={\displaystyle 12\div 4=}.
;
, A scientific calculator will automatically calculate using the correct order.

For example, if your problem is 2 - 4 × -3 ÷ 2, you can type 2−4×−3÷2={\displaystyle 2-4\times -3\div 2=}, and the calculator will automatically do the order of operations for you.
 This will override the calculator’s order of operations.

Hit the beginning parentheses before you hit your first number, and hit the ending parentheses after you hit your last number. The calculator will complete that calculation before you enter your next functions. 

If you need, you can also nest parentheses, though be sure that you can keep track of them.
 If you accidentally hit a wrong key, hit the DEL{\displaystyle {\mathrm {DEL} }} button. This will clear the last button you pressed, but will not clear any calculations you’ve made.
 To clear the line, hit the CLEAR{\displaystyle {\mathrm {CLEAR} }} button. Chances are, you can scroll up to see past calculations. You can hit delete with each line in order to get rid of these.
 To use some functions, you might have to use the 2nd{\displaystyle {\mathrm {2nd} }} key. These functions are listed above the button, similar to how symbols are listed above the number keys on a keyboard. To use these functions, hit the 2nd key first. Getting the syntax right for some operations may involve switching the order between the operation and the number.

For the TI-30X IIS, one of the 2nd functions is to turn off the calculator. Simply press 2nd ON{\displaystyle {\mathrm {2nd} }\ {\mathrm {ON} }}.
 While there are buttons to do this, fractions are much easier to type in manually. The reason is that most scientific calculators only output in decimal format.

For example, to evaluate 4/5 + 6/7, type in 4÷5+6÷7={\displaystyle 4\div 5+6\div 7=} to get approximately 1.657. Use parentheses for more complex operations. 

To convert back to fractions, use 2nd PRB{\displaystyle {\mathrm {2nd} }\ {\mathrm {PRB} }} to get the answer in mixed fractions.
 Do this using the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} button. Type in the number you want to square, then hit the that button.

For example, to square the number 12, type 12 x2={\displaystyle 12\ x^{2}=}.

To find powers of any number, use the ∧{\displaystyle \wedge } key. For example, type 3∧5={\displaystyle 3\wedge 5=} to get 243.
 Type 2nd x2{\displaystyle {\mathrm {2nd} }\ x^{2}} to display the square root.

To find the square root of 9, type 2nd x2 9={\displaystyle {\mathrm {2nd} }\ x^{2}\ 9=}.
 There are two buttons for logarithms. The LOG{\displaystyle {\mathrm {LOG} }} is the logarithm base 10. Use whichever one is appropriate.

For example, to find the logarithm base 10 of 100, simply type LOG 100={\displaystyle {\mathrm {LOG} }\ 100=}.
 The exponential function ex{\displaystyle e^{x}} is found by typing 2nd LN{\displaystyle {\mathrm {2nd} }\ {\mathrm {LN} }}. If you need to use Euler's number only, use e to the first power.

For example, to find the natural log of e, type in LN 2nd LN 1={\displaystyle {\mathrm {LN} }\ {\mathrm {2nd} }\ {\mathrm {LN} }\ 1=}.
 Sine, cosine, and tangent come standard with any scientific calculator. To use these buttons, be sure that you know whether to use degrees or radians. To convert, use the DRG{\displaystyle {\mathrm {DRG} }} button to highlight DEG or RAD. Other calculators will generally have a button that converts between these two systems.

For example, if you wanted to find the sine of 60 degrees, make sure that you are in degree mode by checking the lower right of the display. Then, type SIN 60={\displaystyle {\mathrm {SIN} }\ 60=}.
 Do this using the x−1{\displaystyle x^{-1}} button. On some calculators, it may be labeled as 1/x{\displaystyle 1/x} instead. Type in the number you want to find the reciprocal of, then hit the reciprocal button.

For example, to find the reciprocal of 3, type 3 x−1={\displaystyle 3\ x^{-1}=}.

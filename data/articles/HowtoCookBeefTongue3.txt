 Clean as described in the basic simmer recipe. Place the tongue in a pot of hot water along with 1 of the onions, 2 carrots, 1 stick celery, and 1 clove garlic. Simmer the tongue for about one hour per pound (0.45 kg), until a knife can pierce the thickest part.


Coarsely chop all vegetables, remove leaves from the celery, and crush the garlic.
This is similar to the basic simmer preparation described above, which is how most tongue recipes begin. Refer to that method for more detail if you have any questions.
 Remove the tongue with a pair of tongs. Peel off the white layer as soon as the meat is cool enough to touch. While warm, this should come off easily after a few incisions with a sharp knife.
 Melt 2 tbsp (30 mL) butter in a pan. Chop and add the other onion along with ⅓ cup (80mL) raisins and 3 tbsp (45mL) chopped almonds. Heat while stirring occasionally.
 Once the almonds are golden brown, stir in ⅓ cup (80mL) white wine vinegar and 1 tbsp (15 mL) tomato paste. Add ⅓ cup (80mL) Madeira and ⅔ cup (160 mL) broth from the pot with the tongue. Simmer for three minutes to reduce slightly.
 Slice the tongue into thin slices and pour the raisin sauce over it. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

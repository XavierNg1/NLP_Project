 Place the sausage links in a deep, medium skillet. Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water into the skillet, as well.The water level should not be high enough to completely cover the sausages.
While you can technically cook any type of breakfast sausage using this method, it's best to use it for skinless or "fresh" links. This method may not be as effective for links with skin or sausage patties.
 Place the skillet on the stove over medium-high heat. Simmer the sausage for 6 to 7 minutes, or until the water evaporates.


Continue cooking as long as it takes for the water to naturally evaporate. Do not drain off any of the water. Similarly, do not add more water if it evaporates faster than anticipated.
Do not cover the pan since doing so may slow or prevent the steam from escaping, slowing the overall cooking process as a result.
 Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking the sausages uncovered for another 6 to 7 minutes, or until they're cooked through.


Use tongs to periodically turn the sausage links as they cook. Doing so should promote even browning on all sides.
Note that you should not add any extra oil or fat during the frying part of this process. The fat rendered from the sausages should be enough to cook them.
When ready, the sausages should be brown throughout and the juices should run clear. If you check the internal temperature, the center of the thickest sausage should be a minimum of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius).
 Remove the sausages from the skillet and set them onto several layers of paper towel to drain. After 1 or 2 minutes, transfer the sausages to individual serving plates and enjoy.


Any cooked sausages you don't use immediately should be refrigerated for 1 or 2 days, or frozen for up to 30 days.

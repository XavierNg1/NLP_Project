 If you are just starting out, a Tech Deck is a good way to go. These are the best fingerboards and there are heaps of different brands, such as Girl and Zoo York.;
, When you are using two fingers, then the normal position for fingerboarding is by putting your index finger on the tail (rear) of the board and your middle finger on the logo.
 The Shove It is only for those who use two fingers on the fingerboard. Put your fingers in the normal position, and push your index finger towards you while it is on the board. Keep practicing this until you do a 180Â° spin.
 First up - The Manual. Move the board forward at a moderate speed, while half-popping the board the whole time, and keep it like that, still moving the board forward. For The Nose Manual, just pop the board from the nose, instead of the back.
 Make up your own tricks. You can create scores of your own tricks.
 Pop the board with your middle finger, slide your index finger just underneath your middle finger, but under the board also, next to the wheel. Bring the board to the air, and flip the board over your fingers. Land.

 You can find the Play Store in your Apps list, which can be opened by tapping the ⋮⋮⋮ button on your Home screen.
 There are a variety of emulators available for Android directly from the Play Store for most retro and handheld systems. Below are a few of the most popular:


DraStic (Nintendo DS)
FPse (PlayStation 1)
PPSSPP (PSP)
John GBC (Game Boy and Game Boy Color)
MD.emu (Sega Genesis/Mega Drive)
My Boy! (Game Boy Advance)
Nostalgia.NES (NES)
SuperRetro16 (SNES)

, Note that some emulators require purchase, but may have a free trial available.
 None of the emulators come with ROM (game) files, so you'll need to download these separately using your browser.
 There are dozens of websites that host game files for you to download. You'll be using ROMs for systems that used cartridges (Game Boy, NES, etc.), and ISO files for systems that used CDs (PS1, PSP, etc.).


You can search for "game name rom/iso" to find a specific game, or "system roms/isos" for lists of all available games.
It is illegal in most areas to download game files for games you don't physically own.
 This will begin downloading the file to your Android's storage.
 After you've downloaded a game or two, start up your emulator.
 The process will vary depending on the emulator you are using. Generally you'll be asked to browse your Android's storage and locate the files. If you downloaded them with your browser, you'll find them in your Downloads folder.


Some emulators will scan your storage for game files automatically.

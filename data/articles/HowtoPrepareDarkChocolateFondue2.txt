 Run hot water into your clean fondue pot to warm it up a little. Dry the fondue pot completely and set it over a tea light. Light the tea light and transfer your prepared fondue to the pot. Set out skewers for you guests to dip food into the dark chocolate fondue.

Since chocolate fondue only needs a little heat to stay warm and liquid, you only need the tea light. You don't need to use a gel or alcohol fuel for it.
 Fresh fruit is a classic dipper for dark chocolate fondue. Try to cut the fruit just before serving, so it doesn't darken. Leave the fruit in large chunks, so people can dip them in or stick them on skewers. Some good fruits for dark chocolate fondue include:

Strawberries
Bananas
Pears
Pineapples
Orange segments

, For a really decadent experience, set out desserts that are cut into large pieces. People can dip the dessert pieces directly in the fondue or stick them on skewers. You can set out:

Pound cake
Angel food cake
Shortbread cookies
Brownies
Rice krispy treats

, If you want to offer fun, creative dippers, set out popular snack items. Several snack items pair well with dark chocolate and have a slightly salty bite. Great snack options include:

Pretzels
Potato chips
Popcorn clusters
Marshmallows
Graham crackers

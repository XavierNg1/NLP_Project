 It’s not wise to give your boss a gift only because you are expecting something in return, such as a raise or a promotion. The reason National Boss Day was created was in order for employees to show appreciation to their bosses.;
, Many employees band together and pitch in for a gift for boss’s day. It is an ideal way for everyone to show their appreciation without anyone feeling an economic crunch.
 The best gift to get is one that you want or like. Your boss will appreciate a gift that has obviously been chosen with some care. Think about what interests your boss. For example, a box of golf tees is a thoughtful gift for an avid golfer. Giving a gift that has no relevance at all to your boss will probably be viewed as insincere.
 Even if your salary is substantial, an expensive gift could be perceived the wrong way. Find a way to give something that is reasonably priced, no matter what your income.
 No matter how well you know your boss, or how long you have been with your company, there are boundaries. Avoid giving perfume, jewelry, clothing or personal items of any kind. Here are some suggestions:


Fountain pen
Flowers
Chocolates
Coffee or tea mug
Home baked cookies or canned preserves

, Gag gifts, which are often tasteless, are never a good idea. What you find hysterical may be offensive to your boss. Better to not take a chance.

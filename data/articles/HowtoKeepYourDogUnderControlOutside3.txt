 Teaching your dog the “leave it” command can come in handy if you want your dog to stay away from any food or other objects that are on the ground when they are outdoors. You can teach your dog this command when they are on their leash. Use one of your dog’s toys as the “leave it” object.Hold your dog on the leash and hold a treat in your other hand. Throw your dog’s toy a few feet away from them. When your dog goes for it, lightly tug on the leash and say “leave it.” Once your dog backs off, reward them with a treat.
You may need to practice this command several times with your dog until they obey the “leave it” command.
 If you are worried about your dog wandering off to eat garbage or other things on the ground, keep them on their leash during their walks. Walking your dog on a leash is good training and will ensure they stay within your control. Use a high quality leash that is at least six feet long.You may clip the leash to your waist so you can control your dog as they walk. Your dog should then walk to the side of you and at your pace. You can tug lightly on the leash if your dog gets out of hand or if they do not obey a command.
 Dogs often dig up dirt and soil when they are under-stimulated or bored. You can prevent your dog from digging in your yard by making sure they get enough exercise every day. Take your dog for a walk twice a day and make sure you play with them often. Tiring out your dog is one way of encouraging them to leave the dirt in the yard alone.You should also provide interesting, engaging toys for your dog, such as a Kong stuffed with treats. Having fun toys to play with can discourage your dog from digging up soil.
Sometimes dog will dig at the ground on hot days so they can lie in the cool dirt. If you notice your dog doing this, bring them inside to where it is cooler or set up an area for them outside in the shade.

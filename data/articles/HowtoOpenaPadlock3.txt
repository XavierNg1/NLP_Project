 Tilt the bottom of the padlock towards you so that you can see the keyhole. If it's dark where you are, you may need to use a flashlight or cell phone to illuminate the hole for you.
 Take the key with your index finger and thumb and firmly push it into the keyhole. If it does not fit into the keyhole, turn the key over and try again.If the key won't fit regardless of what you try, there's a good chance that it's the wrong key.
Every key has a different profile which will push pins up inside of the lock and disengage the shackle when you have the right key.
 Most key locks will unlock when you turn the key counterclockwise, although this may not always be the case. Turn your key back and forth if turning it clockwise doesn't open it. You'll feel the shackle disengaging in the lock when you've unlocked it successfully., Once the shackle has disengaged, pull on the body of the lock to free it. You can then rotate the lock to remove it from whatever you're trying to open. When you close the lock back up, make sure that you feel and hear a clicking sound which means that the lock has locked again.


Some padlocks will require you to put the key in and turn it clockwise to lock it.

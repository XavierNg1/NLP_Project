 To believe in something, you must at least understand what it is. Go to the bookstore, library, or search topics on the internet. Look for Hindu, Buddhist, New Age and Wiccan approaches to reincarnation.;
, There are well-known cases where children have gone to strange towns and known residents there and even insisted that a certain home was theirs. Do these stories ring true for you or do you think adults prompted them?

, Look for reincarnation proof in everything and everyone around you. What mechanism creates a child prodigy like Mozart? Could child prodigies simply have learnt their skills in previous lives and now remember them? Do you have friends with incredible skills that came really easily to them?

, If they believe in it, do they have any examples they believe prove it?

, Think undisturbed thoughts about life, death, in-between, and reincarnation. Consider whether it makes more sense to you that your mind simply stops existing after death. And if it doesn't, what do you think could happen to it, besides reincarnation?

, Accepting new ideas takes time, as does finding proof that something is incorrect. Take time to ensure your research totally convinces you.

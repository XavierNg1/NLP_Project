 Locking eyes can cause crazy sparks. Don't try to stare deep into his soul (that could come off as creepy), but if you can catch his eye from across the room or hold his gaze while talking, you can have a major affect on him.Eye contact causes arousal and can lead to feelings of attraction.Try catching his gaze and smiling as you look away. Then glance back at him again.;
, Touching increases attraction and can elevate a person's heart rate, similar to what they experience when falling in love.Finding subtle ways to make physical contact will help you stay on his mind.


Sit next to him so that your shoulders or legs barely touch."Accidentally" graze his arm while reaching for something or brush fingers when you hand him something.Touch his arm to get his attention or emphasize a point, or when he's said something funny.
 Don't use his name to start every other sentence, but drop it into conversation every once in a while. It will grab his attention, foster a sense of intimacy, and reminds him that you're thinking only about him.If he says something that makes you laugh or blush, try saying his name quietly as you laugh.
Nicknames can be fun, too. If you give him a nickname that only you use, your little inside joke will set your relationship apart.
 Don't pour your perfume all over yourself--if it's too strong, it's going to be a turn-off and may even cause headaches or allergic reactions. Apply just a little so he will be able to smell it when you're close to him. His mind will create an association between you and your fragrance.


Consider a fragrance he might encounter when he's not with you. Try rose or lavender, or even something fun like pumpkin pie or coconut. Then, when he walks by a rose bush, he'll instantly think of you.

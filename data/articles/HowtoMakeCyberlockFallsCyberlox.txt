 Most can be found in craft stores, except for the main part: tubular crin. These are the stretchy tubes that work like finger traps. They can be found online. I Kick Shins is a great place to buy them. There are many kinds to choose from: metallic, UV reactive, mini, full size, etc. You will need about 10 yards (9.1Â m). You will also need scissors, elastic, a needle, and thread. Ribbons, rexlace, craft foam are optional.;
, Be careful as they stretch easily and you'll end up with something much shorter than you wanted, so try not to pull too hard. Cut them in half first, then divide them depending on how long and full you want them. Remember to keep them twice as long as you want your falls.
 The simplest and best looking way involves folding the end inside itself.
 Also, thread your needle at this point to make it easier later.


Another way you can do it is fold the cut crin in half (to the length you want). Then do the same to a second one. Then make an X with the two pieces at the middle and tied them together. Then tie it around a hair elastic. Then just keep on doing it. This one may be an easier method.
 The more you use in a single section makes them more full, but you will need more sections for better coverage.
 Make sure you go through all the crin, then over them. Repeat until you used half your crin.

For foam, cut it in strips, and punch a hole in one end. Eyelets keep them from tearing. Paint or draw on them, put stickers on them, punch out shapes, do whatever you like. Attach them with yarn through the eyelets.
Ribbon can just be tied on, with or without a bow.
Just tie on re-lace. You can also bead it.

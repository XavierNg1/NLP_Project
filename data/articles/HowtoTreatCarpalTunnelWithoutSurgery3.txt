 A eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) can help to fight the pain associated with the compression of your median nerve. EMLA is made up of two topical anesthetics, lidocaine and prilocaine. You can purchase EMLA in a cream or ointment form.


Apply the EMLA to the area where you feel pain two to three times a day. Your physician may prescribe a specific dosage depending on your condition.

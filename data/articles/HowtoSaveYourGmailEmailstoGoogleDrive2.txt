 If you would like to save all the email attachments in one go, go to the bottom of the email where all of them can be accessed. Right on top of the line break between the email body and the email attachments are two icons.


The first one is for “Download all attachments,” where you can download all the files in one go as a zipped file to your computer.
The second one is for “Save all to Drive,” where you can forward all the files to your Google Drive in one go.
Click on the second icon with the Google Drive logo. All the file attachments will be immediately copied to Google Drive.
 Your email attachments will be immediately accessible from your Google Drive. You can now organize and manage them like any other file in Google Drive. Just visit https://drive.google.com from your web browser.

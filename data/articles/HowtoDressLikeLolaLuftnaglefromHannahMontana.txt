 In the first season, Lola's look is is more goth, but in the second season she's more punk, like a cross with /Audrey Kitching style, with the occasional crazy raver look. First season look: Purple shirt over black mini with black fishnets and a long wig. Second season: A good outfit idea is a plain puff sleeved top, a striped tank over it, and a long, puffy skirt (maybe tulle). Then add cool, colorful, patterned tights or socks and arm socks with some crazy chunky jewelry! Don't forget color combos. If you're going for first season, the colors are either darker - red & black or purple & black - or really wild and crazy (go ahead and clash!) For the second season, she usually juggles three colors: two neons and a basic, for example royal blue/hot pink/black.;
, In the second season, most of them are short and chin-length in colors like Red, pink, white, light blue, green and more.
 Remember, arm socks are great and so are stockings...hit up Claire's and Hot Topic. Chunky, colorful plastic jewelry will round off the look - think big bangles, plastic bead necklaces, and neon. Lot's of charms and big chunky beads with bold colors and patterns.
 Lola's character is a bold one, never afraid to say what she thinks! So put on a strut.
 If you don't have time, she's confident, cocky, a little loopy and eccentric, and makes you laugh. She's bold and fearless...but if she gets excited, her cool character will dissolve back into hyperventilating Lily!

,, Or the fun punky side: hot pink, white, black.
 Wide headbands with a cool pattern will look great over that bright wig!

, Fishnet frills underneath scream Lola.

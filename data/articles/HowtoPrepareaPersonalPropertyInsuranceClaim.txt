 To ensure that all your property is correctly listed in the right rooms, place "Post-Its" (extra sticky) on each doorway and area of your home and write in the floor level and the room name.;
, To make sure that no rooms are left out later, list each room of each floor on a piece of paper. Take a clear photo of this once it is filled out and hold on to it for later.
 Make sure your camera and/or cell phone camera is set up and there is enough lighting. Begin from the bottom floor and work your way up. Once you choose a room to start, take a macro-close up photo of the "post-it" showing which room you are starting.
, In a clockwise direction, take clear, detailed photos of all of the contents in the room. (Avoid camera shake/blur.)

, Ensure that they came out right, and important details such as what the item is, the brand, model #, etc., are displayed.
, Start with taking a photo of the "Post-It" before you start a room, and complete these steps through all rooms of the house.

 You can also manage signs of food aggression by creating a mealtime routine. In some instances, food-based aggression occurs when a dog is uncertain about when it will get its next meal. Always feed your dog at the same time each day. That way they will become familiar with the routine, reducing their aggressive behaviour.
 Teach your dog a few basic commands, such as sit and stay. This will allow you to control the feeding situation and can help reduce growling and other aggressive behaviour. For example, give your dog the stay command and have them stand a few feet away from you. Drop their food into the bowl and then, once you are ready say “ok.” Then the dog can approach the food and eat.


These commands allow you to be the one in charge of feeding.
 Food aggression, in many instances, stems from dogs competing for food and resources in the wild. You can reduce this behaviour by giving your dog access to food and plenty of space to eat. For example, allow your dog to eat in their own private space, such as their crate or a separate room.


This way they will not feel as though they need to defend or protect their food source.

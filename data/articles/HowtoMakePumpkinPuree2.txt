, Space them evenly along the baking sheet, skin-side down. Try not to let any of the wedges touch, since they won't cook as evenly that way. There's no need to drizzle oil on the wedges; the puree should have no ingredients aside from pure pumpkin if you plan on using it in a recipe later., Place the baking sheet in the oven and let the wedges bake for about 40 minutes. When the wedges are finished, you should be able to easily slide a fork through the flesh. Remove them from the oven and let them cool.


Don't roast the wedges until they turn brown; this affects the flavor of the puree. They should be roasted until they're just cooked through.
Pour some water into the baking tray with the wedges to prevent them from overcooking. The water will create steam as it heats up, helping the pumpkin cook evenly without browning.
 Once the wedges are cool enough to handle, it's time to peel the skin away from the flesh. Use your fingers to lift the skin off of the pumpkin meat. It should come off quite easily. You can use a fork to help you separate the skin if necessary. Put the pumpkin meat into a bowl and discard the skin.
 Place it in a food processor and pulse it until it's completely smooth. Check to make sure there are no remaining lumps. If you don't have a food processor, you can use a blender or a potato masher instead.


If the pumpkin puree seems too dry, add a few spoonfuls of water to moisten it.
If the pumpkin puree seems too wet, strain it through cheesecloth before storing.
 Pumpkin puree can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for several days. You can also place it in freezer bags and freeze it for a few months for later use.

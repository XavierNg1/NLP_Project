 Tons! Small ones to form a bar like The Roost or for 1 or 2 person tables. Big ones for 4 person tables. Combine tables to make bigger seats. Try to match tables!

, Bar stools for the bar and matching chairs for the other tables.Â !IMPORTANT! Only fill up the two opposite sides of the table. No more!

, Make people come to your restaurant. Maybe you could also offer furniture in a separate room for 1/2 off (make sure it's stuff you got free but don't want). Maybe instead of payment, you could also trade for another item. Be original!

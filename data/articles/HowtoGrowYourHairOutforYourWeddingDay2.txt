 Though some advise cutting your hair every six weeks or so, getting your hair trimmed so often will prevent significant growth. Instead get a trim every three months or so to cut away split ends but still allow growth., Brushing wet hair, especially with a metal bristle brush, can damage your hair. It can also cause split ends that are prone to breaking which will stunt the growth of your hair. Instead of brushing wet hair, brush your hair when dry with a boar or nylon bristled brush.If you feel the need to brush your hair when wet, use your fingers to detangle your hair and brush with a wide toothed comb.
 Using heat tools like blow dryers, curling irons or flat irons cause frizz and breakage to your hair. Try to cut out heat tools all together, but if you must use them, use a heat protective spray on your hair beforehand.If you don’t want to reduce your use of heat tools all together, at least give your hair a break a few days a week.
 Clips, hair elastics and pins can cause breakage or even pull out your hair, especially if you aren’t gentle when you remove them. To avoid damage, wear your hair down whenever you can., If you don’t often wear your hair down, you can still wear it up as long as you use care. Use hair elastics without any metal parts, and try to vary the position of your ponytail or bun on your head day by day. This stops your style from pulling on the same section of hair so it doesn’t get pulled out or damaged.

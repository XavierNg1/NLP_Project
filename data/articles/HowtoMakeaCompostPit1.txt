 Your compost hole should be about 1 ft (30.5 cm) deep. The area of the hole will be determined by the amount of organic matter you want to add. At most, the compost material should reach a height of 4 in (10 cm) in the pit.When estimating the hole's size, keep in mind that the compost material will be finely chopped or torn to pieces before being thrown in the hole.
Your pit can be as wide as you like. Garden rows, for example, can be enriched with a compost trench dug at standard pit depth.
If you have a lot of compost material, you can dig a deeper pit, but avoid going deeper than about 3.2 ft (1 m). Important decomposing organisms cannot live beneath this depth.;
, Underground composting happens at a much slower rate than aboveground setups. Exposing as much surface area of the compost materials as possible is the key to speeding the process.


Kitchen scraps can be ripped apart by hand, chopped with a knife, or even pulverized in a blender or food processor.
Yard scraps can be broken down using a lawn mower. Aim for pieces no bigger than 2 to 3 in (5 to 8 cm) long, wide, and thick., It’s time to start composting! Dump your food scraps and yard waste into the hole, but remember – you don’t want the materials you'll be composting any taller than about 4 in (10 cm).Use a shovel to mix the materials together so that they decompose as evenly as possible.
It’s especially important to make sure your carbon-rich materials (such as paper and dried leaves) are mixed thoroughly with your nitrogen-rich materials (like vegetable scraps and fresh grass clippings).
Well-mixed compost materials are important from the outset, as you generally do not turn the materials like you would with other kinds of compost setups.

 There are some places in Animal Jam that you can't get to using the map like the Canyon Trail, and you might just meet a new buddy along the way!

, There are plenty of fun things to do in each location. Some of these things are slides, mini games, shops, statues and fun facts about nature.
 People will almost always join in. If enough animals jump on the center of the bridge, you will see huge cracks appearing in the bridge! The bridge will never break, but it's fun to try!

, Say, "I'm here to adopt a baby!" if you're adopting or "I need a mama/papa!" if you're looking to be adopted. If no one is in the Pillow Room, go to the Town Square and say "If you want to be adopted, go to the Pillow Room!" or "If you want to adopt me, go to the Pillow Room!" Then be a very nice mom/baby and don't be mean at all (although if you are a baby you can act sick or get hurt, just not too much).

 Before you clean your memory foam mattress pad, vacuum any dirt or dust from the pad. This prevents dirt or dust or other materials from getting ground into your mattress pad when you spot clean it., To spot clean your memory foam mattress pad, you can either use an enzymatic cleaner like OxiClean or a homemade solution. To make a homemade solution, mix equal parts water, white distilled vinegar, and lemon juice together., Using a toothbrush, work the cleaner into the stain from the outside of the stain toward the center. Spot cleaning this way prevents the solution from spreading to other areas of the mattress pad., Once you’ve spot cleaned each of the stains on your mattress pad, let the cleaner soak in for ten to fifteen minutes. This will help break up the stain and make it easier to rinse off later., Dip a sponge in cool water, and blot the stains that you’ve spot cleaned. Using a sponge should help soak up the broken-down stains as well as the cleaner that you used. You might need to blot each stain a few times to ensure you get everything up., Once you’ve rinsed the stains on a memory foam pad by blotting, use a clean towel to blot those areas dry. You might need to blot areas dry more than once to get all the moisture out of them. If you can’t fully blot the mattress pad dry, you can let it air dry.

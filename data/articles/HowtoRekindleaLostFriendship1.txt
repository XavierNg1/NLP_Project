 Before you can rekindle the friendship, you need to first make contact with your old friend. Talk to mutual friends, use the internet, or other resources to find how to contact your friend.For example, you could ask a mutual friend, “Have you heard from Sandy lately? I’d love to get in contact with her?”
Try doing a Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, or Whitepages.com search for your friend’s first and last name. Use their middle initial or name if you know it.
If you went to school together, try getting your friend’s contact information from your school’s alumni association.;
, Once you know how to contact your friend, send them a message.Instead of putting your old friend on the spot with a phone call which could be awkward, email them or send them a direct message letting them know you want to rekindle the friendship.


Keep your message brief, genuine, and upbeat. You will have time to catch up on everything later.
For example, you might say, “Hi Carole! It’s Syun-Hi. It’s been a while, but I’d love to get together and catch up. Do you think you might have time soon?”
Or you could try, “Hi, Natalie. This is Tsan from tennis class a few years back. I know it’s been ages, but if you’re up to it, I’d love to catch up.”

, You are probably excited to get back in touch with them, but don’t get offended if your friend doesn’t respond to your message immediately. It could be that your friend is trying to figure out what to say in response or is just extremely busy.Keep in mind that not everyone checks or responds to email or other messages immediately.
Consider the possibility that you may not have the correct contact information.
If you haven’t received a response after a couple of weeks, try your search again to try to find a new way to contact your friend.
If your friend responds, but doesn’t want to rekindle the friendship, then respect that and don’t contact them again.

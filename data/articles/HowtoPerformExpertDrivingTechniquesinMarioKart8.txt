 Since there are several, each step will be used to explain to dodge one item only for time and space's sake., If it comes and you happen to be having a boosting item, simply activate the boost when the shell goes to you and does a spinning animation to get out of the way. Or you can always reverse and let the blue shell explode with the other racers as well., You can either drag items with you. Or you can quickly cut corners where there are walls and ditches. Or even using the rear camera view to dodge it manually. You can always evade it at the last second as a last resort!, Simply just drive around it and get away as quickly as possible before it detonates. Or just like when a blue shell strikes, wait for other racers to come and drive into the bomb to invite them into the fun as well., If you are riding a kart, press the drifting button at the last second; if a bike, do a wheelie at the last second as well. If you are too lazy or poorly skilled to do either, simply shake the Wii Remote to protect yourself (it actually works!), If you have a boosting item, such as a Mushroom, use it as soon as you are sprayed with ink. Or you can even go to the nearest half-pipe, ramp, boost-pad, or giant cannon, if possible to clean out the ink., Though it may seem impossible to dodge, you can still evade those racers entirely by simply moving to the far left or right moments before they appear on screen, or stopping at the edge of the track or an off-road location.

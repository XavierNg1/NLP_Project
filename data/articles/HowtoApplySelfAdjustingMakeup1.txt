 Just like with a regular, color foundation, you want to begin your routine by applying a primer. A makeup primer creates a base for your foundation, helping it to adhere solidly and evenly and last all day. It gives your self-adjusting foundation something to really “stick” to, smoothing out your skin so you can work on an even canvas., Squeeze a bit of the product you’ve chosen onto your fingertip. It will be white or clear right out of the bottle. Dot it on your forehead, your cheeks, your chin, and your nose. You just want to apply the foundation so your face is completely covered, otherwise it will not look even. Then, start blending the product out with your hands.Self-adjusting foundation goes on much like your typical face lotion. Simply dab it on and then blend it out.
Don’t forget to apply it to your eyelids!

, Once your foundation has been applied, you can perfect your skin with your concealer. You will apply your self-adjusting concealer much like you would apply a regular concealer. First, dab it below your eyes to cover dark circles. Blend it out gently. Then, apply it anywhere that you want additional coverage – on blemishes or other imperfections.The self-adjusting concealer will change color depending on where you put it on your face. For example, it might not be the same color under your eyes as it will be on a zit on your chin! It will adjust to match the particular area of your face it’s being applied to.
 After you’ve finished applying your foundation and concealer, it’s important to set your products. By applying a translucent powder, you’ll “seal” your makeup. Use a big fluffy brush to dust the translucent powder lightly over your entire face. Don’t worry, it won’t change the perfect color your self-adjusting makeup has created! This will prevent your face from looking greasy and it will help ensure your products last all day.

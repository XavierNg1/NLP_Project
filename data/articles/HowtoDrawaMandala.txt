, On a mandala template, the centre will be marked. If drawn with a compass, the hole in the paper is the centre. If drawn with a plate, draw a light line in pencil from the top to bottom, and from the left side to the right side; where these lines cross is the centre.
 Line up your motifs along directional lines. (Think of a compass, with lines North-South, East-West, NE-SW, and SE-NW.) If you have a mandala template, these will be marked on the paper. If you're drawing your own template, you'll need a ruler and protractor to mark some lines lightly on your mandala. Using 45Â° angles is a good standard; you will end up with 8 lines. (You can just imagine the lines, but it won't work as well.)








, A diamond or square, a circle, or a star all work well. (These are your "motifs.")








, (You can change colors at any point.)








,, Easy motif shapes include teardrops, flowers, fans, spirals, geometric shapes, and any other forms you like, such as butterflies, birds, dolphins, etc. Repeat some of your motifs, and introduce new ones as you go. Draw some shapes on the directional lines, and some shapes between the lines, to make a more satisfying design. This is especially important as you move outward, where there's more space between the lines.
 As you move outward, your motifs may be larger since you have more space to work with. You can then start putting one shape inside another, again creating more interesting shapes.
 That's fine. The mandala is finished when it feels finished to you.
 That way you can colour it more than once, and share it with others to colour.

 Construct the base of a regular lean-to by finding two close trees and resting a long branch in between them, or tying a rope across if you have one. Then drape a tarp over the branch on one or both sides and weight it down on the ground with rocks, logs, dirt, or snow.If you don’t have a standard tarp, you can also construct a shelter with a poncho, garbage bags, a space/emergency blanket, or other plastic sheeting available.
If you have enough tarp material, lay the tarp over the ground inside the shelter for better protection. For an a-frame tent in this way, the tarp would form a full triangle with the ridgepole at its top point.
 Construct a typical a-frame by propping one end of a large branch against a low crook of a tree, rock, or stump to make a shelter just large enough for your body. Then drape plastic sheeting of any kind you have over the ridgepole with equal lengths on either side, and secure to the ground with heavy objects.Small a-frames are suited to one person for maximum warmth, so they also work well if you have a smaller poncho, garbage bags, or space blanket rather than a large tarp.
You can also construct an a-frame with branches and brush for the walls as you would if you didn’t have any other materials, then use a tarp or other plastic sheeting to cover them for extra warmth and protection.
 Build a simple tube tent if you have at least two large trash bags. Split the bottom of one bag, and slide it partly over the open end of the other bag to make one longer tube.


String up the tube between two trees, rocks, or other structures with a long branch or a rope if you have one.
You can also prop the tube open with branches and brush, or simply crawl into it for sufficient protection.

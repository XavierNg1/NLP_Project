 Dry skin is often rough, with red patches in certain areas. Pores are small and the skin may feel tight. People with dry skin also tend to have flakiness on the face and body.Dry skin may become more irritated from cold weather, harsh soaps, prolonged time on your feet, and after water activities like swimming.;
, You will need a thicker moisturizer that hydrates and attracts moisture to the skin.To hydrate the skin look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid and dimethicone.
Ingredients such as glycerin, proteins, propylene glycol, and urea help attract water to your skin.
Ingredients like Mineral oil, petrolatum, and lanolin help seal in moisture.
Consider treating dry areas with natural ingredients that donâ€™t clog the pores.These may include extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil, or coconut oil.
Avoid fragrances and dyes, especially if you have sensitive skin. An SPF of 30 or higher is recommended for all skin types.
 Dry skin will need to be moisturized at least twice per day. Depending on how dry your skin is, you may need to hydrate your skin several times per day.It is best to moisturize after a shower or any time spent in the water. Pat your skin dry, but allow it to remain a bit damp. Apply your moisturizer immediately afterward to lock in the moisture from the water.
Do not over moisturize. Your skin can become dependent on moisturizer, so only add lotion when needed.
For very dry skin you may also try a hydrating facial mist and apply it throughout the day. You can make your own face mist at home.
Focus on moisturizing from within as well. Drink at least two liters of water and consume foods with healthy fats and protein, such as salmon, avocados, eggs.

 You can copy a real butterfly image or follow a design from a design book or website.


When creating the design, it is important to include areas that can be cut out, such as long shapes or dots on the design, to allow the cellophane to fill these holes. Long teardrop or curved linear shapes are ideal.
The inner edges of the wings that attach to the body piece must be substantial enough to be attached. Give them a decent width to enable gluing or stapling.
 The card should already be in the color you want it to be. Black makes a strong background for cellophane but you might want to use a color to match your costume.


Do two wings, mirror image.
 Also cut out the holes in the design that have been allotted for the cellophane. Depending on how delicate the design is, you might need a craft knife to help with this.
 This is the butterfly's body and will join both wings together. It should be of a reasonable width and about half the length of the wings. Cut it out and put aside; you'll attach the wings to it shortly.
 You have various options:


Use only one color of cellophane. Glue a large piece to the edges of what you consider the be the "back" of each wing. Trim excess away from the edges and it's done.
Use multiple colors of cellophane. Glue them over the holes in the wing design that you wish to match to each color.
You can also add glitter or puff paint designs to the cellophane but this is optional.
 Either glue or staple the wings to the body piece.


Adjust as needed to align properly.
 There are several ways to do this:


Staple two long pieces of thin elastic to the top of the wings, loop around the arms and staple back to the base of the wings.
Staple two long pieces of thin elastic to the middle of the wings. Bring to the front of the wearer and tie a knot and bow to keep in place.
 The wings are now ready for take off.

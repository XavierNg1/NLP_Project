 Dailies, or free games and tasks you can do a certain number of times each day, are a good way to start building a base of np and items you can sell for np. Here's a short list of dailies to get you started (all activities are once per day unless otherwise noted).


Check Weltrude's Toy Chest in PetPet Park.
Play Tiki Tack Tombola.
Collect your gift from the Council Chamber (must have completed Altador plot).
Visit the Deserted Tomb on Mystery Island.
Play Fruit Machine. Can be found at Sakhmet, inside the Lost Desert.
Play Giant Omelette. This is found in the Tyrannian Plateau.
Play Giant Jelly.
Visit Coltzan's Shrine (every 12 hours) in the Lost Desert.
Go Underwater Fishing (can be done several times) in the Maraquan Ruins.
Visit Symol Hole (as many times a day as you want).
Watch AdverVideos (5 times per day). Watch a short ad, then spin for neopoints afterward.
Click the Shop of Offers. Don't actually accept any of the promotions. Just going to the page once a day should get you some neopoints.
Play Potato Counter (3 times per day).
Open the Advent Calendar (during December only).
Play the Wheel of Slime. It is a free luck and chance spin(every 8 hours)

, You don't have to dress up your pet to get points - simply go straight to the end and send your score, which will always be 300 neopoints. You can play the game 3 times per day. Additionally, you can also send a postcard to your email address (or someone else's) for 100 np each time, totaling 1200 neopoints per day.
 Sponsored games are supported by advertisers and offer high payouts of neopoints.
 The games Neopets features each day will give you double neopoints for playing.
 You can get 400 neopoints just for making it to level 2

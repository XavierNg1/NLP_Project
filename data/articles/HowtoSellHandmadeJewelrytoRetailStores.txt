Look at the retailer like you were a customer.
Compare the quality and style of your jewelry to the jewelry that is on display.
Note why or why not your jewelry would sell in each store. If you decide to move forward with a particular store, these notes may also be used to persuade the retailer to purchase from you.



Request an appointment from each business to meet with someone to discuss selling your jewelry.
Keep your sales pitch brief and interesting.



Bring a variety of samples of your jewelry.
Discuss all available styles that you could make for the business.
Bring any relevant catalogs, reviews, photographs, awards, or anything else that may persuade the business to purchase your jewelry.
Bring a list of prices.
When finished, give the prospective buyer a business card and a brochure about your jewelry business.



Agree to deals with as many customers as you can possibly produce for.
Do not take more orders than you can handle, as this may damage relationships with various customers.
Keep in mind that large retailers may be very demanding in terms of quantity and delivery.



Once you have established a regular customer base, focus primarily on producing jewelry.
Plan to make a trip to each customer's location every few weeks to supply them with more jewelry. Alternatively, you can ship it to them.



If your demand is consistently high in your area, hire a Jewelry Representative to market your jewelry to stores in other areas.
Jewelry Representatives generally earn a 15 percent commission.
If the Jewelry Representative brings in a high volume of orders, paying the 15 percent commission will be well worth it.

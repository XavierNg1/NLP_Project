 Have contact with him through his phone, email, Skype, etc. Contact him often, and make sure to tell him that you miss him, love him, are giving him good wishes, and so on. This will remind you how sweet, nice, and/or caring he is. You wouldn't want to cheat on a good person.;
, Note your best times in them, and the times where you knew you loved him or loved him most. Tell him how you miss him so much. You can either mail these to him, or keep them to remind yourself that you're a good, faithful person who won't let him go. These can make you feel happy, guilty for thinking of cheating, or sad. These are all normal reactions.
 This will remind them (and you!) that you're not single, you're connected to somebody. This also lets word get around, so others can point you in the right direction if you're flirting with another person.
 Bars, clubs, etc. should all be avoided completely. Any other place you can meet a possible lover is also a giant no. This keeps you far away from feeling single.

 Put 3 to 4 pieces of ice in a plastic bag and seal it. If you donâ€™t have ice on hand, use a freezer pack instead.The bag helps contain the water from the melting ice cube.
If you are concerned about the water leaking, double bag the ice.;
, Set the bag of ice directly on top of the gum. Let the ice sit on the gum for 5 minutes or until the gum becomes stiff and brittle.Ice will freeze, or harden, the gum. When gum is hard and not sticky, it is easier to remove.
You can also hold the bag of ice against the gum. Prevent your hand from getting cold by placing a towel between the bag of ice and your palm.
 Use a dull putty knife or blade to separate the frozen gum from the fabric of your car seat. The blade should remove all or most of the gum.Keep the blade flat to avoid poking holes in the fabric.
Be patient. It may take awhile to separate the gum from the seat. Go slowly to avoid puncturing the fabric.

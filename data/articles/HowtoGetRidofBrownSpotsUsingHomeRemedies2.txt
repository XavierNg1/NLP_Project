 Enzymes are the workforce of the biochemical world. Enzymes change various substances without getting used up themselves, like nature’s catalytic converters. The enzymes may help break down melanin into colorless smaller parts.The different foods described here contain different enzymes, but all classified as enzymes which break up proteins—the proteases or proteolytic enzymes.
These proteases include papain (in papaya), potato aspartic protease, and bromelain (in pineapple).
 Take one medium sized potato (any kind of white potato will work) and grate it into a bowl. Add enough honey to make a paste.


Apply the mixture to the brown spots.
Leave the mixture on for about 15 minutes, and then rinse it off with cool water.
 Scoop all of the pulp out of a papaya and mash it in a bowl until it is an even consistency. You may want to use a hand mixer to thoroughly mash the fruit.


Use a cotton swab or make-up brush to apply a mask to your face and any other area that has brown spots.
Leave the mask on until it dries and rinse off with cool water.
 Pour some pineapple juice into a bowl (ensure that it is 100% pineapple juice with no added sugar or juice your own pineapple). Using a cotton swab, apply the pineapple juice to any brown spot and leave it on until dry. Rinse off with cool water.


As an alternative, mash up some pineapple slices and apply as a mask to your face and any other area that has brown spots. Leave the mask on until dry, and then rinse off with cool water.
 Cook ½ cup of chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans) by measuring out ¼ cup of peas and boiling them in ½ of water. Boil until the peas are soft (15 minutes for canned beans or about an hour for dried beans), then remove from heat and cool.


When cooled, mash the cooked chick peas to make a paste.
Rub the paste onto the spots and let it dry. Rinse it off with cool water.

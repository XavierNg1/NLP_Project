 This easy body butter can be made in the microwave, so there's no need to mess around with a double boiler. Assemble the following ingredients:


1/2 cup grapeseed oil (or almond oil)
2 tablespoons beeswax
2 tablespoons distilled water
10 drops lemon, lime or orange essential oil

, Place 1/2 cup grapeseed oil and 2 tablespoons beeswax in a canning jar or a heatproof glass measuring cup. Place the mixture in the microwave and heat for 10 to 15 seconds. Stir, then repeat until the oil and beeswax are melted.Be sure to microwave the mixture in short increments to prevent it from getting too hot and burning.
Do not try to cook the mixture in a plastic container, since the plastic could leach into the mixture.
 Add 2 tablespoons filtered or distilled water and 10 drops of orange, lemon or lime essential oil as you continue to blend. The body butter will turn thick and white as you blend. Keep going until it's creamy and rich in texture.


The process of beating the melted oils with water is called emulsifying. It's similar to the process of making whipped cream or mayonnaise. It might take awhile for the mixture to come together, so keep at it until you achieve the right texture.
 An empty lip balm container works well. Use on dry skin as needed.

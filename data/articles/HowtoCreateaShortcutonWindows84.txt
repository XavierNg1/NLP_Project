 You can pin any item from the Start screen onto your Desktop mode taskbar. This is the bar that runs along the bottom of the screen in Desktop mode, and allows you to easily access your most important apps with a single click.
 You can choose from one of the tiles on the main Start screen, or move to your full apps list. You can pull this up by swiping up from the bottom of the screen, or by clicking the down arrow button at the bottom of the Start screen.
 The program will be added to the end of the taskbar icons. You cannot pin Live Tiles.
 Click and drag an icon along the taskbar to rearrange it.

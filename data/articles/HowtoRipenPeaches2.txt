 Select a clean, dry area (such as a space on your kitchen counter) to lay out a linen or cotton napkin. Make sure that it is flat for optimum use of space.
 Place your peaches stem-end down on the linen towel. Spread them out so that they are equidistant from each other, and so none of them are touching (even if you are ripening many peaches).
 Place a second linen or cotton towel over the top of the peaches. Cover them completely, and if possible tuck the sides so that the edges are closed off to fresh air.
 Ripening your peaches with a linen towel may take several days, but will provide juicier fruit. Check your peaches 2-3 days later, paying attention to their softness and looking for that classic peachy smell. If they aren't quite ready, replace the towel and check back a day later.
 When your peaches are soft to the touch and have a great aroma, they are ready to be eaten! Have them fresh or store them in your fridge if you have a surplus you want to extend the life of.

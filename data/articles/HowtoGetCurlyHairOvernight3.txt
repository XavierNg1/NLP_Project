 Curling mousse and an anti-frizz product can enhance your curls. For best results, apply these before any of the other methods.
 Find a sock for waves, or a ribbon for smaller curls. Arrange your hair as follows:


Section your hair into several parts. Begin a pigtail with each one.
Halfway down each pigtail, separate it into two lengths of hair.
Wrap the two lengths of hair around the sock or ribbon, in an over-under helix pattern.
Apply hairspray and leave in overnight.
 This is what hair curlers were made for, after all. Wrap a small section of hair tightly around each roller, and leave in overnight. Check out this article for more detailed information.
 You can make your own hair curlers by wrapping your hair around strips of cloth from an old, cotton T-shirt. Wrap more loosely than you would with curlers, and use larger sections of hair. This gives more of a wavy look than full-on curls.


You can even wrap the hair around your finger, then secure with bobby pins before pulling your finger out. Take care not to poke yourself.
 Wrap a stretchy hairband around your hair, making sure it sits on top of all your hair. Starting on one side of your head, loop a small section of hair around the hairband. Add another small section and loop again. Keep adding on and looping until you get to the back of your head. Repeat from the other side until all your hair is up. Leave in overnight and roll the hairband down in the morning.

 The first circle forms the profile of the nose, and the second is the profile of the nostril. You can slide this second circle up and down to change the final shape of your nose easily.
 This little hook should naturally come off the edge of the smaller circle, the curl back on itself inside the larger circle. This is the outline of the nostril opening.
 The first line is a diagonal line coming off the edge of your bigger circle, the second curls slightly off the bottom of the bigger circle. These attach the nose to your face -- look in the mirror if you're unsure what parts these correspond to on a real face.
 Look at a real nose in profile -- the semi-circles of shading around the nostril end when the nostrils start to meet the bridge of your nose. While you'll be shading along the guidelines, like the other tutorials, you don't need all of them.
 Once again, you want to focus on the guidelines to tell you where to shade. Pay particular attention to the outside edges around the nostril, filling it in as dark as you can to get a nice, dramatic shape.
 The three main areas to highlight in a profile nose are the just above the tip (the rounded bulb at the end of your nose), the top of the bridge, and the small circle of light at the center of your nostril (the part of the nostril closest to the "camera" in your image).

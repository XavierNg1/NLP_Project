 Don't let anyone see the number your write down - even your volunteer. At the end of the trick, you'll reveal this secret number to your audience's delight.
 For instance, if your volunteer picks the number 7,893, she would type "78937893" (78,937,893) into the calculator. Any four digit number will work for this trick.
 Have your volunteer verify this by dividing the eight-digit number in his calculator by 137. Any number made by repeating a four-digit number twice will be evenly divisible by 137. In our example, 78,937,893 divided by 137 = 576,189


This works because repeating the digits in a four-digit number twice is equal to multiplying the original four-digit number by 10,001, which is divisible by 137. Try it!

, For instance, in our example, after dividing 78,937,893 by 137 to get 576,189, our volunteer would divide 576,189 by 7,893. If you've followed the directions right, your volunteer should get an answer of 73 every time, no matter which number she started with.


This works because 10,001 is equal to 137 × 73. Dividing your eight-digit number by 137 gets you an answer that is equal to your original four-digit number × 73, so, by dividing by your four-digit number, you'll get 73 as an answer every time.
 Have your friend or volunteer open the folded piece of paper. When your prediction of 73 is revealed, be prepared for your audience to go wild!


Don't reveal the math behind the trick! A good magician knows how to keep his secrets.

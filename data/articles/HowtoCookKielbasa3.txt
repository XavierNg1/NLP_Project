 The types of kiełbasa that work best for this method are cooked biała (white) kiełbasa and zwyczajna (regular) kiełbasa. You do not need to fry dried kiełbasa, such as kabanos.


If you wish to fry biała (white) kiełbasa, you should cook it first.
 The oil will help the kiełbasa brown nicely, and prevent it from sticking to the pan. You do not need to add a lot of oil, however, as the kiełbasa will release its own oils as it heats.
 If you have any onions or cooked potatoes, consider slicing them up and adding them to the pan as well for a delicious meal.
 You can serve the fried pieces straight from the pan. If they are too oily for you, you can let them sit on some folded paper towels for a few minutes to drain.

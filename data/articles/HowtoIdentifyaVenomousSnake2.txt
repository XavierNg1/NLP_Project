 The adder—common viper, or vipera Berus—features a distinctive V- or X-shaped marking on its head. It also features a vertically-slit pupils, dark zigzag stripes on its back, and dark ovals along its flank. The dark patches range from gray to blue to black (most commonly). The background color is usually a pale gray, though can be brown or brick red.


The adder is common throughout the UK, mostly in the southern regions. While painful and requiring prompt medical attention, adder bites are generally not fatal.
Adders are not particularly aggressive unless disturbed. Given a choice, they'd rather be anywhere than near you.

 If you have a kitchen with stainless steel appliances, for example, you might want to pick decorative pieces made of cool steel or glass. You can also choose accessories that complement and contrast with the rest of your kitchen.


If you have a dark-colored kitchen, try choosing light-colored accessories for it and vice versa.
 This could be a decorating style, a color, a design, feel, etc.
 You may be able to use your accessories every day in your kitchen. Examples are bread boxes, pitchers, or a container for holding cooking utensils.
 KitchenAid and Williams-Sonoma are 2 brands that make kitchen accessories. Look in department stores and/or discount stores for accessories.

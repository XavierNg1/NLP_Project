 Maternity clothes generally do not get much use since they are only worn for 6 months or so at a time. More often than not, the clothing will still be in good shape. Ask your friends and family members if they would be willing to lend you some of the maternity clothes that they wore when they were pregnant.;
, Everyone knows someone who was pregnant at one time or another. Rely on friends and family to reach out to their circles of moms and inquire about collecting maternity clothes that are no longer needed. If you are given clothing that is stained, simple try pre-treating to remove the stain. If possible, embroider or add a decal over the stain.

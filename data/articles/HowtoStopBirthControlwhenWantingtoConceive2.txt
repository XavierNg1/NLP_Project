 Depending on your type of contraceptive pill, stopping mid-month may result in bleeding. Opt to finish off your pack and go through your regular monthly bleeding, which will also make it easier to track your ovulation. It will also help in estimating your due date down the line., Anticipate "withdrawal bleeding" when you stop the pill, similar to the light bleeding or spotting you might experience when you miss taking pills during the month. If you have been taking birth control consistently to skip periods, expect to experience full, period-like bleeding after you stop. During the time after stopping birth control and before getting pregnant, irregular bleeding is normal and not a cause for concern., Everyone's body responds differently to stopping birth control, so it's normal that conception time after stopping ranges widely amongst women. As a general rule, it usually takes several months to conceive, though it can sometimes happen right away. If you still have not gotten pregnant after 6 months free of oral contraceptives, contact your doctor.

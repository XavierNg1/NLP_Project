 An external hard drive can be purchased and connected with a USB cable, eliminating the need to open the computer case.


Connect the external drive using a USB connector cable, typically included with the drive at the time of purchase. The computer can then be configured to boot to the external drive, instead of the internal drive installed on a pre-assembled system.
Install the preferred operating system on the external drive once it has been connected. Follow the instructions included in this article for accessing the BIOS feature and installing the preferred operating system.
 The operating system installed on a pre-assembled system can be erased and replaced with the preferred operating system.


Change the BIOS settings to boot to CD.
Restart the computer and open the BIOS configuration interface by repeatedly pressing the assigned hot-key. The assigned hot-key will vary by BIOS manufacturer, but is typically listed on the bottom of the screen just after the computer is turned on. In most cases the hot-key for opening the system BIOS will be the Delete key, the F1 key, the F2 key, F11 or the F12 key.
Insert the operating system disk or USB into the optical drive. Once the BIOS has been set to boot to the CD, or optical drive, insert the operating system CD and follow the instructions as prompted to format the hard drive and install the new operating system. The installation program will guide you through each step and notify you once the installation is complete.

 Open your book to where the glue binding has broken. You’ll know this has happened because your book will fall easily open to the break, and you’ll be able to see the binding glue. Repairing this will ensure that pages or segments of pages don’t fall out of your binding.The glue binding of thick paperbacks, in particular, are notorious for partially breaking while you’re reading.
 Carefully apply archival glue along the interior seam of the book where the old glue is exposed.

You can use a small brush if you’d like to more evenly apply the glue.
 Close the book securely and put two rubber bands around it to keep it stable. Place one rubber band towards the top of the book and another towards the bottom., While archival glue will dry within a few hours, it’s best practice to leave the book for at least 24 hours to set.

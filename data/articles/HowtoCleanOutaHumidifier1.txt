 Unplug the humidifier first, then remove the filter. Hold it under the faucet and rinse it with cold water to wash away any impurities. Set it on a clean towel to dry while you clean the remaining parts.


Don't use cleaning solution to clean the filter. Chemicals can permanently damage the filter so that it will no longer work properly.
You may have a model of humidifier that requires you to change the filter every now and then. If this is the case, check the manufacturer's instructions and change the filter as often as is recommended.;
, Remove the tank from the humidifier and pour out the old water. Fill the tank with 3 cups of vinegar, swish it around so that it covers the bottom and sides of the tank, and let it sit for at least 1 hour. The vinegar acts as a natural cleanser that loosens buildup from the bottom of the water tank. Rinse the tank thoroughly when you're finished.


If necessary, use a scrub brush to scrub away some of the grime at the bottom of the water tank.
Using another type of cleaner could have negative consequences, since the liquid from the water tank gets pumped into the air. Stick with vinegar to make sure you're creating a safe environment for your family.
If the water tank does not have access for a brush, put in a few tablespoons of rice with the vinegar and cold water to make a loose slurry. Close the tank and agitate vigorously for a minute or so and then let stand for a while. Repeat until the grime has been dislodged. Rinse thoroughly to make sure all the grains are washed out.
 Use a sponge dampened with vinegar and water to wipe the remaining parts of the humidifier. This prevents dust and other debris from entering the water tank, and inhibits the growth of mold or bacteria.

 This is the small button with a woman’s face. The Achievements window will open, which shows a detailed view of your progress for every challenge.


Achievements are special challenges that give Gems as a reward when you complete it.;
, There are several challenges that you can choose from the long list inside the Achievements window. If you’re just starting out on the game, one of the few challenges that you can easily complete is “Bigger Coffers” wherein you need to upgrade one of your Gold Storages to level 10.
 Achievements are divided into three levels. You gain one star for every level of an achievement you complete.


In example; in “Bigger Coffers,” you get your first Achievement star once you upgrade your Gold Storage to level 2, then the next start when it reaches level 5, and then the last Achievement star will be awarded once the Gold Storage reaches level 10.
 Once you earn a complete three star for a challenge, a red mark will appear right on the “Achievement” button. Tap this button to open the Achievement window and check to see your progress for each of the challenges you’re trying to complete.

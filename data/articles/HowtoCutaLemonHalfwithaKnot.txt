, This is to enable the lemon half to sit unaided.

While cutting, angle the knife or cutter slightly inward.
Don't cut the whole way––leave the peeled strip intact when you reach the other side of the circle.
 Curl the peel around and make the knot as for any knot. Don't pull it tight––leave a large loop above the knot, sticking into the air above the lemon half. The loose end should be neatly tucked below the lower half of the knot. The end result looks like half a vertically tied shoelace.
 The garnish is now ready to add to a plate for display and use on the food. Repeat as many times as needed for the remaining lemon halves you wish to use.

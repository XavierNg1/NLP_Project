 Turn the oven on to 300 degrees F (150 C). Wash 2 1/4 pounds (1 kg) of rhubarb and trim off the ends. Slice the rhubarb into pieces that are 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) long. Spread the rhubarb in a large baking dish.The rhubarb should be in a single layer in the dish, so they bake evenly.
 Zest 1 orange and sprinkle it over the rhubarb. Juice the orange and pour the juice in the pan with the rhubarb. Drizzle 4 tablespoons (85 g) of honey over the rhubarb. Use a spoon to stir the rhubarb mixture until it's combined.Try to use an organic orange in this recipe, since you'll be using the zest.
 Lay a sheet of aluminum foil loosely over the pan. Put the rhubarb in the preheated oven and bake it for 30 minutes. Remove the pan and stir it gently. Return the pan to the oven and roast the rhubarb for 15 to 30 more minutes. Remove the pan to a wire rack to cool.Avoid stirring the rhubarb more than once, since the rhubarb could lose its shape.
You can store leftover roasted rhubarb in its syrup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

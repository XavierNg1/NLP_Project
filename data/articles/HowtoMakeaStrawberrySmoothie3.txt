 Yogurt will add additional creaminess and act as a base for the flavor of your strawberries. You can use non-fat, low-fat, or regular yogurt.
 You can use either fresh or frozen strawberries. If using frozen strawberries, you may not need as much ice. If using fresh strawberries, make sure to wash your strawberries and remove the crown (the green leafy stem at the top) before adding your strawberries.
 Blend for about 5 seconds, pause, then blend again. Repeat until mixed. You may need to stir your smoothie with a spoon between mixes to ensure that no strawberries or ice cubes get stuck.


Listen to the sound of the blender. If the blender is making a lot of noise, keep blending until the sound is smooth. Stir one last time with a spoon to ensure that your smoothie is completely blended.
 You can use a fresh banana, or frozen pieces. Blend until smooth.
 Use about a tablespoon to start, then blend. Take a sip of your smoothie and add more honey if you desire additional sweetness.


Avoid adding large amounts of honey to start. Your smoothie can get sweet very quickly and too much honey may ruin your smoothie.
 Serve in a tall chilled glass or cups to share. Top your smoothie off with a straw, and enjoy!


Serve your smoothie over ice, or blend a few ice cubes into the mixture to chill your smoothie if desired.

 There should be many of these in your kitchen: you can use a cutting board, a counter top, or even the bottom of the sink.

, Grasp the egg between the fingers and thumb of your hand. With a sharp twisting motion, spin the egg on its side like a top. The motion you use should be a little like snapping your fingers. It should now be spinning at a steady, regular pace.
 Extend your index finger as if you were pointing. Quickly place your finger down on the center of the rotating egg. It should stop spinning. Immediately remove your finger from the egg as soon as it comes to a stop.





Press hard enough to stop the motion of the egg quickly. It should go from spinning to still in the span of a second or so.
 Depending on whether your egg is hard boiled or raw, it will behave differently at this point. See below:





If the egg stays still, it is a hard boiled egg.
If the egg continues to slowly rotate or wobble it is uncooked. This is because the liquid white and yolk are still spinning inside the shell. The egg's center of gravity shifts as the liquid contents move around, causing the egg to keep moving., The test above should tell you accurately whether or not your egg is hard boiled. However, you can also get this information by carefully watching the way the egg spins â€” you don't need to stop it with your finger. This is convenient if you need to test many eggs at once.





If the egg spins quickly and steadily like a top, the egg is hard boiled. Its center of gravity is stable.
If it spins slowly, it has a major wobble, or it's tough to spin at all, it's raw. The liquid inside is shifting around as the egg spins and throwing it off balance.

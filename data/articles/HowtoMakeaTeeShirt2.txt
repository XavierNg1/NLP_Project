 Stencils are cut outs that allow you to apply spray paint, ink, or marker specific areas of the shirt. The stencil is a guide for where to draw, and it prevents you from making mistakes with complex shapes. To make one, you will need:


Poster board or thin cardboard.
Pencil
X-acto knife or other precision knife
Spray Paint

, The parts that you want to color will be cut out of the board, revealing the shirt underneath.


It can help to color in the stencil lightly. All of the parts you color in will be the design you paint on the shirt eventually.
Think of a stencil like carving a pumpkin -- all the parts you cut away make up the "shape" of the pumpkin.
 Precision knives, like x-acto blades can make fine cuts easily, allowing you to cut out detailed shapes. Cut away all of the parts you do not want covered in ink and discard them, but make sure you leave 4-5 inches of stencil on every side of your design.



Advanced Tip:Remember to leave shapes attached if they are surrounded. For example, if I want to cut out an uppercase "A." but want to save the triangle at the top, I need to keep a think line of poster board attached to the triangle so that I don't cut it out.
 This will prevent ink, paint, or dye from bleeding through to the back of the shirt.
 Make sure the tape does not cover over any part of the shirt you want colored in.
 The stencil will prevent the paint from getting on any parts of the shirt you don't want colored in. Following the instructions on the canister, spray your shirt thoroughly.


For a more vintage look, spray from a distance to create little patches without ink.
 Do not disturb the shirt or the paint could drip and ruin the design.
 You can even use this stencil again for another shirt if you'd like.
 The first 2-3 times you wash the shirt excess spray paint will leak off. Make sure to wash the shirt alone, on cool, to prevent it from ruining your other clothes.

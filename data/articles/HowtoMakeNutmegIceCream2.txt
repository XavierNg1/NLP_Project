 Turn on the heat and heat until just boiling. Remove from the heat and let cool.
 Pour in the cooled cream and milk mixture gradually, whisking continuously as you pour.
 Then pour the entire mixture back into the saucepan and reheat gently. Continue stirring as it heats. After about 8-10 minutes, the mixture will begin to thicken.
 Follow the manufacturer's instructions.


Alternatively, pour into a freezer-proof baking dish lined with greaseproof or parchment paper. Freeze for 1.5 hours; when the edges appear frozen, stir the slightly frozen mixture up, then freeze again for another 1.5 hours. Repeat twice, or until the ice cream is thick and smooth enough to be enjoyed as ice cream.
 Serve with spicy puddings, hot desserts and with milkshakes where nutmeg will complement the flavor deliciously.

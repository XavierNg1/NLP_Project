 This advanced move is a combination of a handstand and a somersault. Start with your legs spaced shoulder-width apart and your body straight. Do a handstand and pause for a moment while your legs are straight in the air. Keeping your legs together, bend your arms and lower your body toward the ground, then tuck in your chin and do a somersault. Finish in standing position with your hands over your head.


Since this move is rather difficult, you might want to try it with a spotter the first few times.
Be extra careful to tuck in your chin so that your head doesn't touch the ground at any time.
 This move is special because of the landing, which looks similar to a back handspring landing. Do a regular somersault, but instead of simply standing up, jump with both feet into a standing position. You'll need to do a fast somersault to get up enough momentum. Use your hands to help propel your body as you jump, then land on your feet and straighten your body with your arms above your head.
 If you really want to impress your friends, try this impressive variation on the basic somersault. Instead of starting in a fixed position, you run and then dive into the roll. Do a short headfirst dive, as though you were diving over a low log. Land on your hands, tuck in your head and immediately launch into a somersault. Move swiftly to your feet and finish with your body straight and your hands stretched over your head.


Don't attempt this move until you've completely mastered the somersault, handstand, front handspring and other advanced moves.
Once you get the hang of it, you can start making bigger dives.

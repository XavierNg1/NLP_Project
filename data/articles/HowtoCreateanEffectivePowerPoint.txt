 Choose an interesting angle for your talk.;
,,,, Choose text that is large and clear to see. Make sure that it is visible from the back of the room you'll be presenting in. It should be clear, easy to read and not blending into the background used.



The references can even be placed below the slide, making them easily findable should you send the slides to people by email.
 They make it hard to read the text.


If you feel you must use a picture as a background, use a transparency behind your text so it is easy to read, and have your text and your transparency contrasting colors. To do this, right click the text box, click on format placeholder, and change the fill to a color and make it transparent. (Around 70-80% transparency works well)
On the other hand, pictures in the background catch the reader's attention and makes your presentation look professional. However, make sure that the words contrast with the background. Also, find large pictures that aren't blurry. Try searching up vector.
, Remember the 5 by 5 rule. Five bullets with less than 5 words each. Please, no long paragraphs or slide long quotes!

, Don't over-exaggerate your animations, slide-ins work really well for bullets.
 Don't try to mix it up because then it will look sloppy. Note: just because you should stick to one slide transition does not mean that you should only stick to one animation.
 Look for mistakes and do touch-ups. Best of all, read it through as if you were giving the presentation and see how it all pulls together.

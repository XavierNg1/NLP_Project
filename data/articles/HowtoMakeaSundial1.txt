 All you need to create it are a few simple items found in your backyard. These tools are a straight stick (about two feet long), a handful of pebbles and a wristwatch or cell phone to tell the time.;
, Push one end of the stick into the grass or earth. If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, slightly slant the stick toward the North. If you live in the Southern Hemisphere, slight it slightly toward the South.If you don’t have access to a grassy area with soft earth, you can improvise.
Fill a small bucket with sand or gravel and plant the stick directly in the center of it.
 Survey the stick at 7:00 a.m. As the sun shines down on it, the stick will cast a shadow. Use one of your pebbles to mark the place where the shadow falls on the ground.
 Return at 8:00 a.m. and use another pebble to mark where the stick’s shadow falls on the ground. Do the same thing at 9:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m. and so on.


If you want the greatest amount of accuracy, use chalk to mark each pebble with the exact time you placed it on the ground.
The shadow will move in a clockwise direction., Return every hour and mark it with a pebble on the ground. Do this until there is no more sunlight left in the day. Your sundial will be complete at day’s end. As long as the sun is shining, you can use this simple device to tell what time of the day it is.

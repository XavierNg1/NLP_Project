 On a calendar, show your child that one row makes one week. Point out each of the days and color code them to make them easier to distinguish, e.g. red for Monday, yellow for Tuesday, etc.
 Children may notice that some days are different from others due to the events they do on each day. Making an association between an event and a particularly day can help them to remember what day it is.


For example, Monday could be soccer day, Wednesday could be mac 'n' cheese for dinner, Sunday could be visiting grandma, etc.
 Counting down to an important event in the child's life can help them to keep track of the days.


For example, if they are excited about going to a birthday party on Saturday, in the week leading up to it you could ask them "How many days left until the party?".
Alternatively, if your child is excited about their own birthday coming up in several weeks, you could ask them "how many more Mondays until your birthday?"

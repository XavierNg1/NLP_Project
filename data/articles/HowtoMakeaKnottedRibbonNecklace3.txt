 Pick a color you like, and one that matches the beads you'll be using.
 Once you have this length, double it, to account for the knots that you're about to make. Then cut the ribbon to size.


To work out the length, get a piece of string and hold it around your neck. Stand in front of the mirror and keep moving the string length until it is of the length you desire, then this string forms your length template.
 These can of any size, but always be sure to match large beads with wide length ribbon and smaller beads with narrower ribbon.
 Take it to the center of the ribbon, then knot each side of the ribbon to keep it in place.
 Knot in place.

 You might add only five very large beads, leaving a lot of ribbon for the rest of the necklace, or you might add a whole long row of smaller beads, leaving less ribbon on the necklace.
 You can simply knot the end together, or attach a clasp (such as a lobster claw clasp) or a button and buttonhole in the ribbon.


Be sure to adjust the necklace to the length you want it before adding the final fittings. If, for any reason, you find the ribbon has become too short, add some wide elastic to lengthen the necklace and stitch in place. If you do this, there is no need to attach a fitting, as the necklace will stretch over your head.

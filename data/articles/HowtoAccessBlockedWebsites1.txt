 A "proxy" is a server that you route your Internet traffic through. This typically requires configuring your browser, which may not be possible on the computer you're using. A web-based proxy is a website that runs on a proxy server. You connect to the website, and then the website connects to the site that is normally blocked from you. It then shows you the blocked site as it work as third person between you and website.


There are countless sites with lists of web proxies. They are available with a quick search ("web proxy list") using your favorite search engine. Note that many of these list sites are also blocked, so you may need to dig deep or access the lists on another computer. Another way is by accessing a proxy with its IP instead of domain, as some network filtering does not filter IP websites.;
, Select one of the sites on the list and open it in your browser. If it's a popular site, there's a chance that it will be blocked too. If that's the case, you'll need to try another site on the list.


Web proxy sites are updated constantly, so you should eventually be able to find one that hasn't been blocked yet.
 Nearly all web proxy sites have a field where you can enter in the URL (address) of the site you want to visit. For example, if you are trying to visit YouTube, you would enter www.youtube.com.
 Connecting to a blocked site through a web proxy will be slower than if you were visiting the site directly. This is because the web proxy has to download the blocked website and then transfer it to you. There may be errors in the page for parts that didn't transfer correctly.


It is highly recommended that you don't use a web proxy for any websites that you need to log into, as you never know who might be seeing the information between you and the proxy. If you need to connect to a secure site, see the "Creating Your Own Proxy at Home" section below.

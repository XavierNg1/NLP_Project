 Muscle atrophy, or the decrease in muscle tone, is usually due to inactivity of muscle groups. Prolonged sitting and resting can cause significant atrophy in as little as one week.Muscle groups that are required for resistance to gravity atrophy more slowly than those that are built up through exercise. Significant studies have been performed with astronauts losing tone thanks to decreased gravity.;
, Some age-related atrophy begins at age 20. This means you will need to work a little harder as you age to keep the muscle you already have.
 Trade in walking, cycling or rowing for swimming, elliptical machines, yoga or a cardio burn class. A whole body workout will improve allover muscle tone more than one that only targets your upper or lower body.


Unlike fat burning, which can’t be targeted to one area of the body, muscles can be selectively built and toned.
 Your trainer can perform a complete body assessment to find out how much muscle tone you have, and which areas or your body you need to target.
 Adults should be doing 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise throughout the week and strength training at least twice per week to develop healthy muscle tone., A recent study found that “chronic” or frequent exercise prevented muscle loss and preserved lean muscle mass in adults.Again, muscle tone is linked to high activity levels.

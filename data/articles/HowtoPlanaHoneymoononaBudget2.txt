 Instead of staying at a resort or hotel, look on sites like Airbnb and FlipKey.These let you find houses, apartments, and other unique property rentals, often for less money than a hotel.You can opt to rent anything from a private room to the entire property, and generally get access to amenities such as a kitchen and laundry as well as a bedroom and bathroom.
These sites also occasionally feature unique rental properties such as tree houses, trailers, remodeled planes, and ships, if you are looking for something to make your trip more memorable.
When you choose a vacation rental, you can often get recommendations for places to eat and drink as well as things to do from your host. You may even be able to arrange a tour of the area with them.
 In certain destinations, particularly in Caribbean islands and South Pacific, all-inclusive resorts allow you the chance to pay a single price for everything including your meals, drinks, and certain selected activities. Deals on all-inclusive packages can often be found online.Before you book, check online or call the hotel to see what is included with your price. While some properties include only the rooms, meals, and access to the property, others may include activities such as snorkeling and diving as well as spa services.
All-inclusive resorts generally do not include activities off of the property, so if you are looking to explore around the area, budget that as an additional cost.
 Online deal sites such as Groupon often feature deals on hotels and vacation packages. Shop around online to find deals on both your accommodations and activities for your honeymoon.Some deal sites offer bargains on full vacation packages that include hotel, flight, and certain tours or planned activities, as well as hotel deals.
You can also contact hotels directly with prices quoted from deal sites for their hotel or for nearby hotels, and see if you can get them to bargain down from there.

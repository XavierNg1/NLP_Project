, Save the unzipped files in the root directory of your web server. The root directory on Apache server is usually "c:\apache group\ apache\htdocs" and in Windows it is usually "/usr/local/apache/htdocs." You can also save the files directly under your host server.
 This will trigger the Joomla Installer and you should see Joomla's pre-installation check page appear.
 Click the "Next" icon on the top-left of the window once you are done.


, You may want to consult with your website administrator first because the configurations should match the attributes of your Joomla website. Assign the following attributes for Joomla in MySQL.


Name of the MySQL database.
Name of the MySQL host (also known as "localhost" if you are installing on a local computer or server).
MySQL username (this should be the same as the root username of your administrative account provided by your website hosting service provider).
MySQL password.
 After you confirm your settings Joomla will try to populate a database using the settings that you have provided.
 In step 2 you just have to enter your site name and hit the "Next" button.
 If you don't enter your own password you should write down the password that has been automatically generated. You can also assign your file permissions and directory permissions associated with Joomla.
 This will take you to the last page of the Joomla installation wizard that will tell you that Joomla has been installed successfully.

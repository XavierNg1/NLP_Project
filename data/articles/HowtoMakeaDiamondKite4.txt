 The dowels will be used as the frame of the kite. If you can purchase them already cut to size, that’s great, but if not, you’ll need to carefully cut them down.


Use ¼ inch (.6 cm) dowels.
Use either a small hacksaw or a box cutter to trim the dowels to size. Do this either outside or over the trashcan to avoid leaving sawdust all over.
If you made the body of the kite smaller than 40 inches in length, cut the dowels to the length you measured the body at.
 The horizontal stick should be about 10 in (25 cm) from the top of the vertical stick. Using kite string, about 12 in (30 cm) or so, tie it tightly around the intersection of the sticks. Make a few knots so the sticks are tightly secured together.It doesn’t matter too much how you tie the string here, as long as the sticks are secured together. You can also put some tape or glue over the string for added strength.
 Make a small cut on each of the corners of the kite. Fold these flaps over the dowel pieces and tape them securely in place. Duct tape is best, but just make sure the tape holds the frame to the body securely.


Once the corners are attached, you can place 2-4 pieces of tape along each dowel so the kite is secured across the whole body of the kite.
 This is the tail of the kite, which will help stabilize it in the wind. You can also tie shorter strips onto the main tail for extra drag. To add more color, you could use bright strips of cloth instead.
 Poke 4 small holes through the plastic around the center of the crossed dowels, one hole in each angle of the cross. Lead the kite string through all four holes and tie securely to the center cross section.


This is the string which you will hold when you fly the kite, so make sure it is plenty long enough. How high a kite can fly will depend on the wind, but you’ll probably want at least 20 yards (18 meters) of string.

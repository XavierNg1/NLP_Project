 Cats tend to hide health issues, but behavioral changes often accompany underlying medical issues. If your cat becomes uncharacteristically fearful, anxious, or aggressive, it might be experiencing pain or discomfort associated with a health problem.If your cat becomes fearful or aggressive, schedule a vet visit and observe its mobility, eating habits, urination, and bowel movements. Feel its body for lumps, sores, and other abnormalities, and report anything suspicious to the vet.  

, Disorientation, confusion, getting lost, decreased activity, anxiety, and increased meowing are all signs of cognitive dysfunction, or senility. While often related to senility, these symptoms can also point to pain or an underlying medical condition.Take your cat to the vet to rule out medical causes. If the vet determines your cat has developed cognitive dysfunction, ask them if they recommend medication. You should also take steps to make your cat’s surroundings more comfortable and easier to use.
 If your cat’s litter box has high sides, switch it out for a lower one to make it easier to use. If it shows signs of senility and has trouble finding its litter box, consider adding boxes in other locations (in addition to keeping any existing boxes where they are).Avoid changes in food, water, and litter box placement. Make sure your cat can access these items, as well as its bed and toys, without having to go up or down stairs.

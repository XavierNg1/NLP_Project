 iPhones have the nice feature of being able to send "Group Messages" or individual text messages to multiple people. A group message allows you to send messages to multiple people at once. It sets up a "group chat". This means that if someone you messaged replies, they will be replying to the whole group. The whole group will also be able to see other members. This works using iMessage and thus will only work if all people in the group have iPhones.

 Individual messages are good when you want to send the same message to multiple people (e.g. "Happy Thanksgiving!" or "Remember the meeting at 6") without starting a group chat and therefore causing people to see all the message receivers and get replies from them.;
, This should be on if you want to send a group message and off if you wish to send individual messages.

This setting can be accessed by first tapping on the "Settings" icon on your home screen.
Scroll down and tap on the "Messaging" option.
Scroll down to the "Group Messaging" option and turn it on or off as desired.
 To do this, first open a new message. Then enter all of the names or phone numbers of people you wish to message. In more detail:

Click the "Messages" icon on your home screen.
Start a new message by clicking the new message icon which is a pad and pen, in the upper right corner of the Messages screen.
Your cursor will automatically be in the "To:" line of the message. Either type names of people in your contacts and select them from the options that will show up or directly enter their numbers here. The cursor should remain in this section until you choose to move on to the message section.
 Recall that the message is entered in the bar or space at the bottom of the message screen. Once you top on it, your keyboard should pop up and allow you to type any message you desire.

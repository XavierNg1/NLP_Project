 Yes, this may be an awkward conversation. You may want to be honest and tell your friend about your crush, however, particularly if you continue to have strong feelings.Your friend may be able to provide some perspective and advice.


You could say, “This is kind of embarrassing, but I really like Emily. I’ve liked her for a few months now. I thought I’d tell you because I’m not sure what I should do, and I’d like to hear what you think.”
Keep in mind that your friend might have a strong reaction, like “Ew, no, she’s my sister!” or “I’m totally freaked out by this.” You could respond, “I know how weird it probably is for you. I thought a lot about whether or not I should tell you. But I decided to be honest with you about it, because my feelings haven’t changed.”

, Your friend might be angry, disgusted, or maybe even think it’s a great idea. Ask your friend what they think you should do. They may be able to see something about the situation that you are blind to.


You could say, “I was wondering if you think I should ask her out. But I don’t want to let this get between us and ruin our friendship. I don’t want to do it if it will be too weird for you.”
Give your friend some time to think about their response if they need to.
 If your friend doesn’t want you to date their sister, accept their answer and do your best to move on. If you go against your friend’s wishes to pursue their sister, you will likely damage your friendship.


Keep in mind that later in life, you will likely have a greater regret about losing a friendship than not pursuing a crush.

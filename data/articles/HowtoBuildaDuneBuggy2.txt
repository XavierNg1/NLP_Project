 There are dune buggy kits available for all tastes, levels of experience, and pocketbooks.


For example, a company such as Berrien Buggy (www.berrienbuggy.com) has various body styles, frames, etc. so that you can build a custom buggy using pre-built parts.






Another option is a completely pre-designed kit—all you do is the assembly. A company such as Myers Manx (www.meyersmanx.com) is a good example of this type of kit.
 If you want to build from scratch, but don't want to design it all yourself, purchase a set of plans. They're normally about $25 to $35 USD (as of 2012). You source the parts and components yourself, so there is potential savings in finding the best price for each individual item.


Amazon is a good source for plans.






Most dune buggy sites have community forums. Spend some time seeing what people are talking about—you can glean a lot of good information by seeing what people like, and what they don't like about any given company or product.

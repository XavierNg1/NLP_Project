 It is important to walk confidently and wear a smile. Sneaking up is kind of creepy, and it may come off wrong.;
, When you've established eye contact approach and say something simple, like "Hey, How are you?".


Keep it simple. try not to ask about too personal things such as past relationships, loves ones passing away, or emotional topics.
 When they say "hi" back to you, smile and introduce yourself.


You might also add how you know them, or how they might know you. For example, "Hi, I'm Johnny. We were in film class together last semester." This helps avoid embarrassing situations or that awkward silence when they don't remember you.
 Presumably you would like to get to know this person to whom you've just introduced yourself. If you have something in common, talk about that. You could say, "Are you still a fan of Richard Linklater," or "I'd love to talk with you for a few minutes, why don't we get out of this hailstorm!"

, If they look at you strangely and hurry away, don't chase them. Not only is it kind of creepy, it could get you into trouble. If they smile and start talking with you, congratulations, you've successfully greeted somebody and made a new friend, too!

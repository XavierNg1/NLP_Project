 Once you are ready to install it, proceed with the next steps.
 Do this unless you plan on painting the entire car after the body kit installation.
 Use a grease remover or a lacquer thinner with a paper towel, and rub on the entire surface. Avoid leaving the paper towel on the car for too long as this can harm the car's paint surface.
 This will help the adhesive to stick to the paint of the car and help to hold the body kit in place. Use a lint-free cloth coat on the entire surface area where you will apply double-sided tape.


Repeat these steps each time you remove a part of your factory-installed pieces, including the front bumper, side skirts, and rear bumper.

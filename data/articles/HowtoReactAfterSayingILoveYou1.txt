 Prepare a response:



Ask yourself if you love them. Clarify your feelings for them in your own mind.
Prepare a response based on your feelings. There's no need to learn off a speech and carry around your notes in case they 'fess their feelings. However, especially if your answer isn't an outright 'Yes, me too, me too', it is important to have the right words in the moment. Having a few lines roughly planned out will smooth over the awkwardness.
Give a moment's thought as to how you will reply through body language. Do not give them false hope if you're not interested or not sure. A genuine smile and touching them on the arm or hand shows you're touched but you're not about to rush into their arm either.;
, That doesn't mean telling them straight out that you're not in love with them. Mention how they're a great friend and are really special to you. Perhaps you're glad you met them and you really like them (but that's it as of now!). You'll know what's appropriate. Make it clear what they do mean to you and make them feel valued but clarify the situation of you think you're on a different page to each other.

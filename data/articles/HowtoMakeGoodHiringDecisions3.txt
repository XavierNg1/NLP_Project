 Even though it’s the highlight of the process, the interview isn’t the end all, be all of the hiring process. It’s one tool among many. The experience, education, and (perhaps) test results of a candidate can be far more instructive of actual performance.
 You created your objective measurements for a reason, and they are important to take into account, but some things are difficult to measure. Don’t dismiss a subjective impression just because it doesn’t fit onto your grid.Subjective factors might include things like poise, quick-thinking, and creativity.
 The culture of your organization is another factor that can get overlooked. If your organization values outside-box-thinking and a challenging atmosphere, a career military officer might not be the best fit at your place of business.This factor is one to analyze carefully. An employee who fits with the overall institutional culture is likely to be happier and more productive. However, glossing over why or why not a candidate is a good fit can lead to unconscious discrimination.
 References go unchecked as often as not. Don’t make this mistake. While no one is going to consciously put forward a bad reference, a reference can be about more than simple pluses and minuses.


Look at the quality of the reference, not simply whether it’s positive or negative. Is it bland and vague, or vivid and specific? The answer tells you a lot about the employee’s impact at their former organization. A forgettable employee is much more likely to receive a nondescript reference.
 Once you've settled on a candidate, make them an offer. Consider two factors when you make your offer, what you can afford, and what you think it would take to get them on board.


You don't want to give away the store right off the bat, so make an offer that's within your budget but high enough that they know you're serious about trying to hire them.

 Even in a pet fountain, where the water is constantly circulating, it is important to change the water often. How often you need to change the water depends on the particular model you purchased. Consult manufacturer directions for information about how and how often you should change the water. Empty the pet fountain and refill it with a supply of fresh, clean water when necessary., The pet fountain doesn’t need to be filled to the brim, but it should be at or just above the minimum fill line. Pet fountains that are not filled to the appropriate level will overheat and eventually stop working. Always refill the pet fountain with cold water., Pet fountains are complex pieces of machinery and need to be taken care of. This means you should clean your pet fountain’s filter (usually every 2-4 weeks) and impeller. Wipe around and under the fountain to prevent mold and moisture buildup.Every pet fountain is slightly different. Follow maintenance directions provided by your fountain’s manufacturer to determine how and how often to conduct maintenance on your fountain.

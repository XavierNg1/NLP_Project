 Look for a surgeon that has the necessary training to perform the operation you need. You want a specialist certified by the American Board of Medical Specialties. This tells you that they received a degree from a qualified medical school, completed their residency, is licensed by a state medical board, and passed at least on ABMS exam. You can check the qualifications of your doctor by going to certificationmatters.org., Check with your state medical board to see if your surgeon has had any malpractice claims or disciplinary actions. Although most surgeons are sued once or twice, a specialist who has been sued multiple times may be problematic. In addition, multiple disciplinary actions may be an indication of substance abuse or a behavioral issue., Once you have narrowed down your options, you should schedule some consultations with various surgeons. Talk with them about their success and complication rates when performing your operation, and ask them how many of this type of procedure they have performed. You should also talk with them about their attitudes on an alternative to surgery. Finally, it is important to get a feel for whether you trust this person. Listen to your gut and determine if you are comfortable with this person potentially having your life in their hands.A doctor who is confident in their ability and has a solid track record will be willing to discuss their success rate with you.
You should ask your surgeon things like “What is your success rate with this procedure?” and “Do you recommend any alternatives to surgery?”

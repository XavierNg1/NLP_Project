 The first choice of dosage forms for SSRI is the pill, since it’s generally considered the safest and most efficient method. However, many SSRI also come in liquid and transdermal gels. If you have trouble administering an SSRI in pill form, ask the vet to prescribe another dosage form., You can administer an SSRI in liquid form using a syringe-like dispenser. Insert the dispenser between your cat’s cheek and teeth, then pull the plunger to squirt the medication into its mouth. Massage its neck or blow onto its nose to encourage it to swallow the medicine.Liquid medication is more likely than a pill to enter a cat’s windpipe and pose a choking hazard. Don’t hold your cat’s head back when administering liquid medication to prevent accidental inhalation, and be sure to squirt between its cheek and teeth.
 While absorbed much less efficiently than tablets or capsules, a transdermal gel might be the only safe and feasible option if you have trouble with other dosage forms. To use the applicator, rotate the nozzle to measure out the proper dosage amount. Depending on the vet’s instructions, apply the medication either in your cat’s ear or directly onto its skin.Use your hand to part your cat’s fur when applying a transdermal gel to its skin.
Your cat might experience a rash at the application site.

 This includes footwear, as shoes, even rubber soled, tend to make unwanted sound when coming down on a surface. Socks are generally the best choice. Also, make sure what you wear isn't too baggy, or it may make unwanted sound when it rubs against itself/other objects.;
, They make HUGE amounts of noise when they hit against themselves or other objects. Zippers on pants are OK, but avoid ones that swing loosely off of jackets or other garments.
 When you step down on a wooden floor, keep close to the walls. This is generally the best supported part of the wall and therefore the least creaky. Nonetheless, make sure to test the floor at each step to make sure it won't creak loudly.
 Although less noisy than wooden floors, any surface can be hazardous to the careless. Another method is to walk on the outside of your foot. This may take a little practice but is a proven method.
 Likewise when closing a door.
 By opening a door slowly, you can be more sneaky because since the movement is slow, someone's eyes may not be able to pick it up very well. The only downside to this is if the door is squeaky. You must be VERY careful in this situation. If you hear the slightest squeak, close the door IMMEDIATELY, but DON'T slam it, and try not to make noise when it closes. At this point, you must open the door at a faster rate than before, but don't just rush it open. Another way squeaks may be reduced is by lifting up on the knob, as this takes pressure off of the hinges., If you are walking along a narrow area, this will help a lot.

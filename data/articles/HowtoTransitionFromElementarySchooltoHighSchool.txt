 High school is a great experience that you can only do once, so be prepared for fun! If you have any friends who are upperclassmen, connect with them so you'll see familiar faces on the first day of school.;
, You might learn some of the school's traditions, rules, and staff. You should also get used to the size and feel of the school. However, if you're feeling uncomfortable, sit with some old middle school friends or talk with a guidance counsellor. Sharing problems will help ease the stress.
 Or, if you are at a totally new school where you know no one, try asking people about their interests, and eventually you'll be friends.
 Your teachers will have a higher expectation of you than in eighth grade, but they'll be a little easier the first or second week. Also, you'll want to make a great first impression.
 Watching 10th graders and doing what they do is a good start, but don't try to fit in rudely, by pretending to like things you really don't like, just to be popular. Hang around people who can give info, as to what is acceptable for a freshmen to do.
 Ask your big brother/sister questions and listen to the answers.
 For example, if they have a business on selling stuff at lockers, don't start selling stuff out of your locker. They will feel like you're mocking them, so don't try to copy seniors. Let them be who they want to be, they're graduating.
 There will be a wider range of things to do in high school, besides your academics, so pick 1-2 clubs and establish yourself. But don't try out for every club, as a freshman can only handle so much work and clubs.
 You'll have so much fun, you'll realize that those 8th grade dances were nothing!

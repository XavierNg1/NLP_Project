 Shake table salt over the slugs to dehydrate and kill them.
 Fill the bottom of the bowl with beer.


The snails and slugs will be attracted to the beer. They will crawl inside the bowl and drown. Check your bowl every morning to remove drowned pests. Continue pouring beer in the bowl each night until you don't find any slugs or snails in it in the morning.

 Driving in shoes, especially on long trips can contribute to their wear and tear. Instead of wearing your favorite shoes while you drive, consider using an old pair of shoes or getting driving shoes.This will minimize the stress on your shoes and elongate their life.


Do not drive barefoot.
 Extensive physical activity is the number one factor in wearing out shoes and sneakers. If you are concerned with the cost of buying more than one pair of shoes, you should consider the fact that wearing out one pair of shoes will eventually necessitate the purchase of another pair, which can cost you more over the long run. Casual shoes should also be kept separately from your dress shoes.
 While it doesn't seem like it would help, tying and untying your shoelaces will make your shoes last longer. When you slip on shoes without tying them, you put pressure on the heel counter, which provides structure and shape for your shoes. Don't slide your foot in and out of your shoe without tying them.
 A shoe horn is a piece of wood or metal that helps you slip on your shoes. The apparatus fits behind your foot and forms to your heel. As an alternative, you can use a credit card or driver's license if you don't have a shoe horn. Just like tying and untying the laces, not using a shoe horn can damage the structural integrity of your shoe.

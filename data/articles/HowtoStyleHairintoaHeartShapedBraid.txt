 This is also the time to brush out any knots and tangles in the hair.;
, One important thing to know is how to make a lace braid. If you don't know, learn how because this hairstyle is all about lace braids. Lace braids are basically normal braids, just adding in sections of hair into every weave you do.
 Make sure that the strips of hair you use are equal and more towards the middle of the sectioned line in the head. Start with either strip of either side. This means to grab two equivalent strips of hair for each side of the head, and choose either left or right or start with.
, It is important that you stand directly in front of the person when starting the braid to make this slight curve effect for the heart. to do this, stand right in front of the person.
 Then, start to curve around the side of the head.
 When you get there, start to move the braid inwards to close the heart at the bottom. Make sure you hands are the only things moving when curving the braid around the person's head while trying to perfect the braid. Make sure all the hair below it is completely flattened.


When you complete the first side/half of the braid, move on to the other side of the head. To make it look pretty, make sure the two sides are identical. The other side is self explanatory. If you don't remember what to do, just go back to the first step until you have completed both sides.
 You can either join two sides in a braid with the remaining hair that is hanging loose, or put it in a ponytail. You may do whatever your heart desires on the remaining amount of hair.
 You can decorate the hair a little or simply just admire it. This style is not something that you can get perfect right away, but in time you will learn. Be patient and practice to make it perfect.

 If your partner has an email from someone you don’t recognize, you can do a reverse email search. You can also do an online reverse phone search.
 If you suspect that your spouse is cheating on you with someone in particular, or you have come across the name of someone, you can often locate more information about that person by searching online. This is also useful to try to establish what interests the other person may have, what their job is, what their family situation is, and how much money they may have.
 When a simple internet search doesn’t turn up much information, you can pay to have a more extensive background check. These can be very affordable, ranging from $15 to $40 or more. Some of these services are more reputable than others, so do a bit of research about the service to see what feedback it’s received.

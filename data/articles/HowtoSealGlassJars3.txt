 To seal your jars with wax, you'll need a ceramic wax sealer dish, filament tape, scissors, a tea candle, a kitchen lighter, and bottle sealing wax. You should be able to find a lot of these supplies at a local craft store or department store. However, if you can't find them in your area you should be able to order them online. This process is best for glass jars and bottles with slim necks., If you've purchased a wax sealer dish with a place for the candle beneath it, you can just place the sealer on the table. If not, you'll need to put it on a small rack so that a candle can go beneath it.
 Light a tea candle. Then, place it beneath the wax heating dish.
 Add granular wax in any color to the ceramic dish. As the wax melts, add more wax to the dish until the liquefied wax is about 2cm from the top of the dish.


The wax will take about 20 minutes to melt. Blow out the candle when it's finished.
 Twist the cap on the bottle. Make sure the cap is on tight. If it isnâ€™t used for eating, you can use a cork instead.
 Wrap the filament tape around the cork or the cap where it meets the jar until it overlaps on itself. Cut the filament tape. Bend the end that's sticking out and push it against the rest of the tape. The bent part will be what is pulled to undo the seal.
 Turn the jar upside down. Dip it straight down into the wax. Lift it straight up a moment later. Spin it as soon as you remove it from the wax to prevent unwanted dripping.
 This step is optional. Press your engraved wax seal into the top immediately after dipping. A monogrammed or symbolic wax seal is a great way to personalize your project. Allow it to sit and dry completely before transporting.

 Leonardo Pisano Bigollo, also known as Fibonacci, was a famous Italian mathematician who discovered an interesting sequence of numbers which are now named after him. The sequence goes as follows, with numbers generated by adding the last two digits together: 1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 8 - 13 - 21 - 34 - 55 - 89 - 144 - 233 - 377 - 610.









The Fibonacci strategy involves betting by adding the last two bets together. One advantage of this is that you can come out with a profit by losing more games than you've won. But one serious disadvantage is that the further you go down the sequence, the more money you lose. In other words, strike quit or get out of the way.
 Alternately, because the Fibonacci strategy is an even chance betting system, you can also place a bet on even or odd number, as well as 1-18 or 19-36.
 If you started off with a bet of $1 and lose, bet another $1. If you lose that, bet $2 — $1 + $1 = $2.
 Here's an example of how you might bet — including winning and losing bets — using the Fibonacci strategy:









Bet black, $3 — lose
Bet black, $3 — lose
Bet black, $6 — lose
Bet black, $9 — lose
Bet black, $15 — win
Bet black, $6 — lose
Bet black, $9 — win
Bet black, $3 — win
Bet black, $3 — win

- 3 - 3 - 6 - 9 + 15 - 6 + 9 + 3 +3 = +3
You lost five bet and only won four, but you're still ahead +3.

 When a bathing suit is too small, it can cause the child a lot of discomfort and can also give her a rash if the elastic is too tight. On the other hand, when a bathing suit is too large, it can cause your child to experience a lot of difficulty when she is swimming or doing other water activities.


Some girls may be more comfortable in bathing suits that have regular straps as opposed to bathing suits that are halter style and tie around the neck. When the suits tie around the neck, the straps can dig into the skin, which can be uncomfortable for some children.
Boys may be more comfortable wearing longer board shorts that hang just above the knee rather than shorter ones.;
, There are many different types of swimsuit materials and the type that you should choose depends on what kind of activities your child will be doing while wearing the bathing suit. Some bathing suits have a soft material that keeps your child comfortable and are designed to prevent her from breaking out in a rash. There are also bathing suits made of material that dries quickly and keeps your child comfortable as well; a lycra and spandex mix is the best material for drying quickly.
 There are certain materials that can help minimize the amount of UV rays that penetrate your childâ€™s skin while she is wearing the suit. It is also important to check all of the materials used to make the bathing suit, so that you know if your child is allergic to any of those materials.
 When babies and toddlers are playing in the pool it can be hard to get them out of the pool to go to the bathroom, even if they are in the process of potty training. If you purchase a suit that makes it easier to change their diaper often, you can avoid embarrassing accidents in the pool.

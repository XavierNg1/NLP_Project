 Books that give an overview regarding the basic beliefs, the 5 pillars, prayers, rituals, etc. Make sure that the book is not biased and if possible written by a practicing Muslim.;
, Locate a mosque in your areas and visit them at prayer times, for example, just before sunset or after noon. Wait to see the people exiting the mosque and try to engage in a conversation with them.
 Call them before hand and tell them your purpose for learning about Islam. They'll probably invite you to come over. Before heading out write several key questions on a piece of paper and bring along a tape recorder or notebook to record any information.
 Don't forget to refer to Muslims if there is anything in the Qur'an you don't understand.
 Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim are the most reliable books. Read books by many famous Muslim theologians and mystics- one is Al-Ghazali, a really interesting book which talks about how Muslims should live their lives (with references to the Qur'an and Hadith) is 'The Alchemy of Happiness'.
 Be careful though, since you are talking to an anonymous person, he or she might not provide you with accurate information.

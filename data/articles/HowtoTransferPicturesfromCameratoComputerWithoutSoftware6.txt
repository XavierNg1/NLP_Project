 This is a simple step. You can usually connect your camera directly to your computer or just take out your memory card and stick it into a card reader that is connected to your computer. The usual connection is via USB.


Your camera or memory card to your computer the Windows XP Camera Wizard window should come up when you connect. If it doesn’t then you can bring it up separately by clicking on: Start -> Accessories -> Scanner and Camera Wizard.
 This next step allows you to choose which pictures you want to transfer. Also, the wizard allows you to rotate the pictures and also view picture details like the date when the picture was taken. This way you can determine how you will name your destination folder. Most of the times however, you would just move all the pictures into one folder on your computer without doing anything else…but if you want more information, the wizard gives your this ability.
 Now you have two fields you have to fill in.


The first one is entitled: Type a name for this group of pictures. The value that you enter here will be the final file name of each picture on your computer. For example: if you know that the pictures you're transferring were taken on June 21, 2012, and they were taken at Idora Park, set the group name to 070612-Idora-Park, and then each file will feature this name plus an index counter: 01,02, etc. This way you can also identify each picture by its name.






The second one is entitled: Choose a place to save this group of pictures. This is the place to specify your destination folder for these pictures. So you can click the browse button (the yellow folder) and choose the destination folder on your hard disk.
 Check your destination folder—all the pics should be there.

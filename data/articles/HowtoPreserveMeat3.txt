 This can be done at home using your stove and oven. Cut meat into narrow strips with a cross section of 1cm x 1cm.Boil strips of meat on the stove for 3-5 minutes to get rid of bacteria.
Remove the meat from the water and let drain until dry.
Bake in an oven (on the lowest setting) for 8-12 hours.
You could also use a commercial food dehydrator instead of an oven.Properly dried meat will feel sticky, hard, or leathery.Meat dehydrated this way will last 1-2 months in air-tight containers without refrigeration.
 Smoking also adds flavor to meats.


Cure meat with salt before drying to extend shelf-life.
Smoke the meat in a smoker at 145 degrees Fahrenheit for 7 hours or 155 degrees Fahrenheit for 4 hours. Do not exceed 155 degrees Fahrenheit as this will cook the meat, not dry or smoke it.Some cuts of meat will take longer. For example, a brisket may take 22 hours to smoke thoroughly.Use a meat thermometer to make sure the meat reaches a safe temperature before removing from the smoker. Poultry should reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees F; pork and ground meats should be 160 degrees F; steaks, roasts and chops should be 145 degrees F.Commercial smokers use gas, electricity, charcoal or wood.Add wood such as mesquite, hickory, oak or cherry to add flavor to the meat.Smoked meats can last 1-2 months in air-tight containers.

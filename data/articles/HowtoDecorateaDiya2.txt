 This includes any other diya that you may have lying around itching for eye catching design. Bricolage is art that is constructed from a wide range of available material, and can set your diya apart from the rest.For this decorative endeavor, you will want to have:


Acrylic paints (assorted colors)
Bucket or tub
Diya(s)
Clear epoxy/shellac (non-flammable)
Glass beads (optional)
Glitter (optional)
Glue (non-flammable)
Paintbrushes
Small knick-knacks and bric-a-brac
Small pebbles and stones
Stiff bristle brush

, Dirtiness can ruin the bond made by your epoxy and make your bricolage design loose or delicate. You should clean your diya by soaking it in a bucket or tub filled with warm water. Do this for about an hour, and then scrub it with your stiff bristle brush.Before adding any paint to your diya, you should allow it to dry completely.
 You can do so by painting a base of paint over all surfaces of your diya. This will give a uniform base color and an even surface for your paint to bond with. Choosing a strong base color, like red or gold, can also give the items you glue to your lamp appeal.


Allow your priming layer of paint to dry completely before moving on. If your priming layer does not look consistent, you may want to paint another layer to give it a uniform look.
 Using a brush, apply your epoxy to a small section of your diya. You don't want to paint on too much adhesive; doing so will waste it, as it is likely to dry before you can attach your knick-knacks to your lamp.
 Colored stones, glass beads, and other like material can be stuck to the area you have painted with glue in interesting shapes and designs. Be prepared to move quick, as the glue will begin drying as soon as it's applied.
 When your bricolage design is finished and dry, you may want to consider adding depth to your artistic diya with some glitter. Aim for parts of your design that have natural prominence and further bring these out with an application of glitter.

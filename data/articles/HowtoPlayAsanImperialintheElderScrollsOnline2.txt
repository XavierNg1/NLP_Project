 From the main menu, press the “Create character” button found at the bottom right of the screen. Once you have started the character creation process, you will be able to choose Imperial as your race, as long as you have activated the Imperial Edition upgrade or own the Imperial Edition.
 On the character creation screen, you’ll have a whole host of information to go through on the right side of your screen. From top to bottom, you’ll have four icons to switch between, an entry field for your character’s name, a gender option, an alliance option and finally the choice between 10 different races. If you only see 9 races, this means you do not own the Imperial Edition or the Imperial Edition upgrade. You can choose any information here, but make sure to choose the Imperial race, at the bottom of the list.
 Once you have chosen Imperial as a race, you’re given the choice to pick between four different classes. After this, you can work on your character’s physical appearance by adjusting the different sliders and color pickers. Finally, you can use more sliders to adjust the appearance of your character’s face. After this final step, simply press the “Create” button at the bottom right side of your screen, and your Imperial character will have been created and you can begin playing the game with the character.

 Assume a standing straddle position with your legs spread shoulder length apart. Your hips and shoulders are in line with the direction in which you intend to cartwheel.Whether you’re performing the cartwheel towards your left or right depends on whatever you’re most comfortable with. Try out both ways, if you’re unsure.
 Stretch your arms out to your sides, keeping them level with your arms., Point your lead food toward the direction you’ll be going while turning the other foot slightly outward for better balance.
 Plant your lead hand on the ground and then your other leg should follow it up in the air.If your left hand was your lead, your right leg should lift up.
 Plant your other hand down in line with your lead hand and your remaining leg will follow in the air., Balance your weight on your arms, using your shoulders and core for support, like a handstand. Your legs in the air should assume a v-shape.Both hands should be in line with each other.
Stack your hips over your shoulders, keeping your body straight.
 To get yourself out of the cartwheel, you’ll land on your lead hand with your non-lead leg following.If your left hand was your lead, you’ll land on your left hand with your right leg following in a line.
 With the side-to-side cartwheel, you’ll land in the same position in which you started with your legs in straddle and your hands in the air.

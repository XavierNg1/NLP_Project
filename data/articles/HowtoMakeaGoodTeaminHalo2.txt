 You should get one of each for your team. Snipers, well obviously snipe people. The Heavy use big weapons such as rocket launchers or dual needlers. Heavies also run right in the middle of the battlefield and blast the crap out of enemies while being covered (being protected) by Snipers or Vehicle Fighters. Scouts/Spies' use light and effective weapons such as the noob combo (dual plasma pistols) or plasma rifles and usually cover people or check for enemies. The Vehicle Fighter drives the team around in Warthogs or fires at enemies in Ghosts, it's important that the Vehicle Fighter knows how to actually drive the vehicle and not spin in circles trying to turn.;
, Have a few people hide and the rest go run around the map, once someone goes by the ambush squad, open fire!! This technique is important too.

 You can choose from a standard detoxification cleanse, which utilizes baking soda and sea salt, or an herbal one, which typically entails the usage of such ingredients as coffee. Coffee is known for its laxative properties, and when used in an internal bath, offers an ideal alternative to the baking soda/sea salt option.;
, You will need an enema kit to conduct your cleanse. This is an essential component of learning how to take an internal bath. Enema bags, hoses, and nozzles are available in a variety of price ranges and quality levels. Find one that best matches the goals of your cleanse. For instance, if you plan on taking an internal bath regularly, you may want to invest in a higher quality enema kit than if you were planning on conducting the cleanse once or twice or to treat an intermittent health problem.
 The recipe for a standard cleanse is 1 tsp. baking soda, 1 tsp. sea salt, and 4 cups (32 oz.) water. Make sure the water is warm as this will create the most comfortable internal bath. If you're opting for a more alternative option, follow your recipe carefully and, again, be sure the water is lukewarm and comfortable in temperature.
 This can best be achieved by bending over and sliding the nozzle of the enema bag into your rectum. Gently apply pressure to the bag so the cleansing mixture flows slowly and smoothly into your body. When the bag is empty or you feel full, remove it and set it aside.
 This will help the cleansing ingredients properly disperse around the colon and bathe the entire area. Stay in the bent-over position for a few minutes or until the need to expel the mixture is strong. After you release the contents, you can repeat this process as necessary.

 Most real opals are mined in Australia, which is the opal capital of the world. Russia and Hong Kong make high quality fake opals that some shady jewelers try to pass off as the real thing. If your opal does not come from Australia then you should seriously suspect its validity.;
, If the opal is a natural stone, then even with cutting and polishing it may not be entirely symmetrical. If the opal is a perfect circle or oval, then you should have a licensed jeweler inspect it before you make the purchase.
 Do not use a fluorescent light, because it can make the opal appear to have more facets than it actually does and can give the impression of additional colors. If the opal seems to have multiple layers of color, then this is a good indication that it is the real thing. However, if an opal only appears to have colors immediately below the surface, it may be a fake.
 A real opal, even a small one, will usually cost over $100. If an opal in a jewelry setting costs only $20 or $40, then you should suspect the bargain.
 An opal created in a laboratory (Gilson opal)displays bright colours in large patches of colour. The pattern is often 'too perfect' and ordered, and can also often display a 'snakeskin' pattern.

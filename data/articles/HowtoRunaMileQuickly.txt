 You'll want to drink approximately .25 of your weight but in ounces. If you drink too much, you will get a cramp which is sure to slow you down. But before the run it isn't all about water.;
, Which includes Hamstrings, Thighs, calves, Biceps, triceps, and your back. You should feel loose and ready to run!

, What also helps to pump you up for the run is music. But you can listen to whatever as long as you like it. But if you don't like it, it won't pump you up. So don't listen to heavy metal to look cool, listen to if it helps you pump it up.
 Go farther back so you have room. Eventually every one will shift around, including you.
 At about a ten minute mile pace. Which means go slow. A jog basically. If people take off running, it may urge you to go and sprint, but you'll lose all your steam in like 30 seconds.
 Sooner or later you'll pass people quickly! You will still have enough energy to keep going. If you feel like you don't have enough, slow it down or take some swigs of water. Then you should be going a little faster.
 Try to keep your mind focused on form and breathing properly. Like in through your nose and out through your mouth always saves energy. But if you can, just keep going with whatever you breath like. Try to sing a song in your head if you can't carry a portable music player with you.
 If you can start to count your steps to see how far you have to go. If you can't see the finish line just keep going.
 As fast as your legs will carry you. Feel the wind in your face and know that it's pride. And once you cross, drink another .25 of water. And also breathe through your nose, it will make you stop panting.

 This little-used makeup gem is a key ingredient to prepping skin before makeup, as it fills in fine lines and wrinkles as well as smooths your face.
 Use a cross pattern from your forehead to chin, and then ear to ear. Use very small dots of primer as you go, and gently press the primer into the skin of your face.

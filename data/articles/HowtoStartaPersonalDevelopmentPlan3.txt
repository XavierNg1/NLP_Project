 There are many ways to educate yourself in order to learn more about the area you are seeking to improve. Informing yourself on the topics you are committed to improving will help keep you up to date on latest improvements in your field of interest and keep you inspired.


Check your local paper for community educational classes.
Go to your local library and source out books and read them.
Learn from other people's experiences and knowledge and commit to an online course or seminar that will inspire you.
Ask friends that are successful in the area you want to improve in what resources they use.
 Note taking is an active process, making you an active learner. While taking a seminar, or listening to a motivational CD, write down notes on what you are learning. How does it apply to your goals? Taking notes will keep the information you are learning fresh in your mind and also help you keep track of your progress.
 Let's be honest, if you don't think about your goals, you won't make them happen. If you aren't doing anything about your goals, they are just wishes. At a set time, perhaps monday mornings, review your progress for the last week and set new action steps for the upcoming week that push you towards your ultimate goal. Reading your goals weekly helps remind you of their importance and keeps you clear on what you truly want in your life.Check to see if you are on track with your deadline. Perhaps you need to kick it up a notch and take more small steps to achieving your goal.
Make sure you are challenging yourself enough. If the goal is becoming too easy to attain, perhaps you need to make the goal more challenging by adding a new component. For example, "I run two miles a day" instead of "I run a half mile a day."
Check to see if you are still inspired by your goals. If not, reorganize them until you feel more enthusiastic.

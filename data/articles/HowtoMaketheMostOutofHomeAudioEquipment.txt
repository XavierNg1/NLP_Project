If the room is rectangular in shape, your speakers should face the length of the room. Position your couch or desk facing the shortest end of the wall. This will allow you to sit directly in the aim of the speakers.;
, The speakers should sit in the first third of the room facing away from the wall.


The speakers, assuming the room is large enough, should each be positioned a little more than three feet away from the long sides of the wall.
 Key to positioning home audio speakers is a need for space between the speakers and the wall. This is because the rattle of the bass can easily bounce off of a nearby wall, distorting the sound.
 While positioning your speakers at an exact angle is difficult to do, anyone can eyeball an angle of roughly 60 degrees. This sixty degree angle will help offer the best use of most music and many films’ stereo sound. With pro audio equipment you will find that the angle helps you hear intricacies you might have otherwise never heard.


Your subwoofer should be at least 30 centimeters (11.8 in) from the wall. Do not place it in the dead center of the wall.
 Speaker stands should be adjusted to just about your eye level.
 This will keep these items from becoming bass boosting, sound distorting annoyances.


Surround sound home theater equipment has some slightly different rules than stereo speakers. The center channel should be placed directly in front of your primary seating place. Each speaker should be placed 110 degrees away from each other and should be approximately equal distance from where you plan to sit.

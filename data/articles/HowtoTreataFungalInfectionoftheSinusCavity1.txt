 Aspergillus fungi will first infect the paranasal sinuses and airways. It may then progress down into the lung tissue, or remain in the sinuses. At this time, the fungi will form a fungus ball, or aspergilloma, which is the hallmark of this infection.


A fungus ball is a mass of fungi that form together. To treat this ball, it must be surgically removed.;
, This fungus ball can only be treated through surgical removal, followed by a draining of the sinuses. This surgical procedure is called an antrotomy.


The idea is to remove the fungus ball, and then clear the sinuses by literally ‘sucking out’ the fungi with a vacuum as part of the surgical follow up.
 This procedure is usually done under general anesthesia, but maxillary antrostomy is considered a “day surgery” , meaning that you can leave the hospital after the surgical intervention. The procedure typically lasts a couple of hours.
 Since the maxillary sinus is the most common sinus in which Aspergillomas may be found, there are two ways to approach it. One is through the gums, into the canine fossa, which gives direct connection to the maxillary sinus. The other is through the nose.


Regardless of which path is chosen, the surgeon will use a camera to find the fungus ball so that he or she can remove it.
 This surgery is minimally invasive, which means that only a small area of tissue is actually involved in the surgery.

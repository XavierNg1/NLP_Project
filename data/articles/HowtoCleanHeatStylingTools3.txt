 Gunk and debris may come off easier if you wash products while they're a little warm. After unplugging a beauty supply product, allow it to cool until it's lukewarm before attempting to wash it.Never clean a product that's still plugged in.
 Items like curling irons and flat irons may build up a lot of dirt and debris. If it's been awhile since you've cleaned these tools, this may not come off easily. Try treating them white vinegar.Place white vinegar in a spray bottle. Spray it on the tools about 6 to 8 inches away from them.
Then, wipe the tools down.
 If your items have not been washed in a long time, use alcohol swabs. You may to disinfect something like a hairbrush or comb if it's potentially harboring bacteria. For example, if you dropped your brush outdoors, you may want to wash it with alcohol.

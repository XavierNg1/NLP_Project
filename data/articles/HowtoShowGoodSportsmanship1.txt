 When your competitive juices start flowing, it may be tempting to call members of the other team names or make fun of them. But you can’t win a game by running your mouth, and it only makes you look desperate. Focus on outperforming your opponent on the field or court, not on landing a good insult., In the heat of a game, it can be easy to lose your cool, particularly if you’ve just gotten elbowed or the other team keeps scoring on you. Don’t let your anger affect your behavior, though. Sports are supposed to be fun, so don’t lose sight of the big picture just because things are going your way.Retaliating against another player if they’ve hit, pushed, elbowed, or otherwise tried to injury you is never a good idea. You’ll only wind up penalizing your own team.
Avoid any violent confrontations with other players. If someone threatens you or you’re worried a situation is going to escalate, talk to the officials or a coach.
 Whether they’re outplaying you or unable to keep up with your team, it’s important to recognize that they’ve put in plenty of hard work to prepare for the game, just like your team has. Having respect for the other team is crucial to good sportsmanship.You may actually be able to learn something from your opponent, so keep an open mind. If they’re playing better than you are, you may be able to pick up some pointers for the next game.
 When you win a big game, it’s easy to get carried away in your celebration. However, if you’re a good sport, you don’t gloat over a victory or try to make your opponents feel bad about their performance. Conversely, if you lose, you shouldn’t pout or downplay the other team’s victory.Whether you win or lose, get in the habit of congratulating the other team. It shows that you value the game itself and the effort that goes into it just as much as an actual victory.

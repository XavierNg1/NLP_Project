 Potassium bromide (KBr) is often used as an additional therapy in dogs whose symptoms are not controlled by one drug alone.


Potassium bromide acts differently to phenobarbital, and the two drugs work synergistically. This means that each drug amplifies the effect of the other, and the two combined have a greater effect than either by themselves.
Potassium bromide works by replacing chloride molecules with bromide, thus making it more difficult for nerves to fire off.
 Unlike phenobarbital which rises to therapeutic levels in a week or two, it takes potassium bromide months to reach a steady, effective state.


Hence, sodium bromide is rarely used as a solo therapy because if anti-convulsants are needed, it is usually impossible to wait months for them to take effect.
However, in combination with phenobarbital, potassium bromide seems to have a therapeutic effect before it reaches a steady level in the blood stream, hence it can be helpful in combination.
 If focal seizures are not controlled by phenobarbital alone then potassium bromide is added at a dose rate of 20-40mg/kg a day. Thus a 30 kg Labrador is supplemented with 600mg of potassium bromide a day.


The dog should be placed on a low salt diet during this treatment, because the chloride from salt will displace the bromide molecule from the nerves and decrease its effectiveness.

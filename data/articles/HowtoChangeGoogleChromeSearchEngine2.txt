 Look for the Google Chrome app on your mobile device and tap on it. The web browser will load.
 Tap on the icon or button on your device for the menu. It can look like three vertical dots or three horizontal lines. This will bring out the main menu. Tap on “Settings” from the options to open the Settings window.
 Right beside the field is the current default search engine.
 Tap on the Search Engine line and the options for the search engine will be listed. The options will only include the more popular ones, such as Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. There’s no option for adding your own search engine on the mobile app.


Select the one you’d like to use from the list, and tap on it.
 This will save your changes.

 Tap the pre-installed application on your tablet called “Notes” or “Memo.” It should be the one with a notepad icon. A notepad will then appear on your screen.
 Tap the plus “+” icon on the top left-hand corner of the Notes application screen to create a fresh new page to write on.
 Some tablets do not have a Stylus included, like generic Android tablets sold in the market. For these devices, as soon as you create a new page, the on-screen keyboard of your tablet will appear. Start typing your notes just like how you’d compose a text message.
 Once you’re done typing, save your new note by tapping the “Save” button on your tablet’s screen.

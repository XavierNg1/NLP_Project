 Once you have opened Pro Tools on your computer, create a new session by going to File and selecting New Session. If you are using Pro Tools on a Macintosh, you can press the Control and letter M keys simultaneously to create a new session. The New Session dialog box will appear on your screen.;
, Next to "Save As," type in a name for your new session. Next to "Where," choose the location on your computer where you want to save your audio files.
 The bottom portion of the New Session dialog box contains the settings for Session Parameters.


Select the correct audio file type. Click on the arrows within Audio File Type to display the drop-down menu and select your desired audio file type. The Audio File Type field you select will determine the file type for every file created in this specific session.
Select the sample rate. Click on the arrows within Sample Rate to display the drop-down menu and select your desired sample rate. The options in the Sample Rate field will vary depending on the hardware you are using with Pro Tools. Higher sample rates are generally used for television projects, whereas lower sample rates are usually used on radio or music projects. Although higher sample rates may result in higher quality, they will also produce larger files on your computer.
Designate the Bit Depth. Choose between 16-bit depth or 24-bit depth by clicking on the correct radio button. 24-bit depth may produce better quality and a greater dynamic range compared to 16-bit depth, but will also consume more memory on your computer.
Select input and output settings. Click on the arrows within the Input and Output Settings field to display the drop-down menu and make the selection based on your preference.
 On the bottom of the New Session dialog box, click on the Save button to create your new session.

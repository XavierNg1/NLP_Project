Don't worry about not liking the food. If you don't like it, at least you've learned something new about yourself and have one more thing to talk about.
 When learning something new, fully embrace the experience. When in classes or at shows, volunteer when teachers or performers ask. Directly interacting with the demonstrator will help you to stay present in the moment and fully embrace the new task.


If you are shy or have social anxiety, you may not be comfortable volunteering in front of others. You might try staying after class to ask questions or request individual assistance.

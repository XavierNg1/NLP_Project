, Most undergraduates who were born after 1980s are well exposed to standard Mandarin. They can help create an ideal environment for practicing standard pronunciation.
 For example, Henan, the province next to Beijing, was an important cradle for ancient Chinese culture, but the local dialect is overwhelmingly spoken than standard mandarin. And to some ears, the accents in Dongbei, north-eastern China which was the home of Royal family of Qing Dynasty, are regarded as vulgar and not standard.

 You are likely being asked to take a percentage discount off of a price or value. For example, you might be asked what 30% off 120 dollars is.
 To do this, remove the percentage sign and think of the percent as a whole number. Then, move the decimal point two places to the left.Sometimes the percent will have a decimal already (such as in 7.5%). If there is no decimal, remember that a whole number always has an understood decimal to the right of the ones place (such as 75 = 75.00).

For example, 30%{\displaystyle 30\%} converted to a decimal is 0.30{\displaystyle 0.30}.
 You can multiply be a calculator, or by hand. If multiplying by hand, set up the problem like a regular multiplication problem. Multiply the numbers as usual. Your final answer should have two places to the right of its decimal point. For more information on how to multiply decimals, read Multiply Decimals.

For example, 120×0.3036.00{\displaystyle {\begin{array}{r}120\\\times 0.30\\\hline \\36.00\end{array}}}


, The difference is the result of subtracting the percent of a value from the whole value.

For example, 120−36=84{\displaystyle 120-36=84}. So, 120−30%=84{\displaystyle 120-30\%=84}. 


, 

For example, $120×0.70$84.00{\displaystyle {\begin{array}{r}\$120\\\times 0.70\\\hline \\\$84.00\end{array}}}

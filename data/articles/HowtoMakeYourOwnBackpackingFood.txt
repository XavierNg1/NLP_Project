 Will you be only using it for backpacking or is your wife a master chef and she might want one later down the road. What you want to use it for will probably determine how much you're willing to spend.;
, Dehydrators can get very pricey so make sure you know ow much you want to spend. This depend on what you will be using it for. If your wife will be using every month and you will be using it once or twice a year then opt for an expensive one that costs around $150 to $200. On the cheaper ones the motors can burn out over a period of time. If you plan on using it once or twice a year then buy one that's between $50 and $100.
 You can always get a good deal somewhere. Look not only in stores but also online. Most department stores will sell them and if you plan on shopping online then look at massive retailers such as Amazon.
 The easiest place to find good recipes for dehydrated food is online. They sell some books in stores but typically they are extremely expensive.
 If you know a bunch of people that go hiking (i.e Boy Scout Troop or hiking club) ask them. Most veteran hikers dehydrate there own food and they would love to share recipes and give you some tips.
 Do not just use your own favorite normal dish and throw it in a dehydrator because certain foods dehydrate better than others. When looking at recipes use common sense.
 When making dehydrated food follow directions to the exact word. If you don't you risk messing up something that you just waited tenÂ hours to finish.
 Most of the time when you are dehydrating food it will take up wards of five hours. You just have to wait because if you pull it out to early you can ruin the food or make the process even longer.
 Now that you have finished your first meal test it out. See how much water it takes to re hydrate because it will vary on the dehydrator you used. Make sure you like how it tastes so you don't get into the back-country and hate all of the food you brought with you.

 Although Slashers are reasonably easy to kill on their own, they usually travel in groups of two or more, so keeping your distance is key. Select a medium to long-range weapon such as the plasma cutter to increase your chance of killing the Slasher before it reaches you. They will overwhelm you in numbers.;
, Remember, shooting the Slasher's body is useless, so you need to aim for their limbs. The most effective combination to take them down is to aim for their legs initially as they are a large target. If this doesn't kill them, it will drop them to the ground, where you can then aim for either their arms or head if you are a good aim or curb stomp them. Use melee only as a last resort,

, Slashers are reasonably easy to fight off with the melee, especially if you're only facing one. They will usually take about 3-6 hits to kill. Because of their larger size, they are one of the only Necromorphs you can melee effectively, so if you are trying to unlock the Brawler achievement, then take advantage of them.
 Especially if you are using the legs/arms combo, then using stasis on a Slasher will give you the time you need to implement this. This is particularly effective when you are facing a large group of Necromorphs or Slashers and you need to lower their numbers. If you can, use the stasis cheat.
 If they manage to hook onto you and bite into your neck, then press A repeatedly to push them off. Unlike other Necromorphs, this will not kill them, so you will still need to finish them off, either with a melee or shot. If you can push them off into a Gravity Panel, the it will also help you get your Ragdoll Check achievement.

 Scrambling to get ready in the morning does not help you to feel organized for the day. To avoid a last minute scramble, put everything in your backpack the night before school, fix your lunch the night before, and set out your outfit the night before.


Getting ready the night before will also allow you to have a little more sleep in the morning. Fewer things to do in the morning means less time you need to get ready to go.
Make getting ready for the next day a habit, just like the habit of brushing your teeth before bed. Don't go to bed for the night until everything is organized for the next day.
 It can be very tempting to hit the snooze button on your alarm or sleep for just a few more minutes in the morning when you are very sleepy. However, if you want to have an organized day, it's important to give yourself enough time in the morning so you can get all the things you need to do done.


For example, waking up with plenty of time to eat breakfast is very important. Skipping breakfast in exchange for a few more minutes of sleep will not serve you well for the rest of the morning.
Don't underestimate how much time it takes for you to get ready. If you are rushed to get to school, then you will have a harder time settling into your day once you get there.
 It is hard to be organized and calm when you are rushing to school every morning. Being on time to school in an unrushed way is one of the most important things you can do to start your day off in an organized way.


If you are having a hard time getting to school because of other people, like your ride is always late, consider trying to change your means of transportation. Perhaps instead of getting a ride you could ride your bike, so that you can leave your home when you need to to get to school on time.

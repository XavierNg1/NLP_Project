 Make sure the drive is either CD-RW or DVD-RW. The ‘W’ stands for writeable, and is necessary to burn information to the disc.


The type of drive is usually printed on the front, but the information can also be found in Control Panel > Device Manager > Disk Drives.;
, This can be accessed from Start > All Apps (All Programs in Windows 7 and earlier) > Windows Media Player. This is the stock media player that is supplied with Windows.


This guide’s steps refer to WMP 12. Other versions of the software will also work, but button locations may vary.
 This opens a panel on the right to create a burn list.
 The files will need to be a filetype supported by WMP (.mp3, .mp4, .wav, .aac, are among the most common). When burned to a CD, the software will transcode the files to a lossless format.


Audio CDs are limited to an 80 minute playtime. This is an industry standard set by manufacturers. This means that the number of songs you can fit onto the CD will vary depending on the length of the track.
CD packaging may also mention a 700MB capacity, but this measurement is used for making data CDs. A data CD works like a storage device and can only be read by computers.
 This opens a menu with different burn options. Select “Audio CD” from the menu.
 The CD burn process will begin. After completion the disc will eject automatically and be ready for playback.


If you cancel the burn process or it fails you will need to use a new CD to try again.

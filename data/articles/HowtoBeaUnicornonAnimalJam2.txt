 Is he/she good? Bad? Neutral? Or is it unclear? What are the reasons behind what side he/she is on?

, This can be done by writing down his/her traits or by roleplaying them and finding out what their personality is.
 Does he/she live alone? Do they live in a herd?

, Do they have magic similar to the magic used in My Little Pony? Is it similar to the Greek mythological unicorn's magic, which could detect if a drink was poisoned and purify water? Is their horn more naturalistic, only used as a weapon in combat? Or do they have powers that are non-magical but not scientific either? Are they elemental? Does your traditional unicorn's ruby at the base of its horn power more than just its magic?

, Does it live with its herd if it has one? Is it a jungle-dweller (Lost Temple of Zios), a forest fanatic (Sarepia Forest), a winter creature (Mt Shiveer), a canyon climber (Coral Canyons) a beachgoer (Crystal Sands), a sea unicorn (Crystal Reef, Bahari Bay, Kani Cove, Deep Blue), or does it live in a savannah or desert (Appondale, Kimbara Outback)? Or is it not listed here (Decorate your den to look like its home)?

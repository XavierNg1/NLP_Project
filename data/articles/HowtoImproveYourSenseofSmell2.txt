 Have you ever noticed that your sense of smell fades, or perhaps completely disappears, when you have a cold? Congestion in the membranes in the nose that contain the smell-sensitive nerve endings can dull your ability to smell, and avoiding foods that promote stuffiness (generally dairy products like milk, cheese, yogurt and ice cream) might help. Gradually re-introducing these foods one-by-one will help you to identify which have the biggest impact.








There is a channel from the back of your throat to the sensory cells in your nose. If this channel is blocked by any kind of congestion, your ability to taste food will be affected., Various pollutants such as chemical fumes can interfere with your sense of smell. Smoking is one common example of a substance that can compromise your ability to smell. Quitting could help you recover a better sense of smell.Your smell will be most diminished in the thirty minutes after smoking a cigarette.









Various drugs can hamper your ability to smell. These includes stimulants, depressants, antibiotics and other drugs. If you think you are taking something that might be impairing your sense of smell, contact your doctor.Some cold remedies can make you lose your sense of smell.Be sure you don't stop taking a prescribed course of drugs without talking to your doctor first.
 There is a suggestion that prolonged exposure to bad smells tends to numb your ability to smell. For example, someone who works with compost everyday might over time become less sensitive to the odour.Try to avoid prolonged exposure to strong smells, and if you do have to be around them, consider wearing a mask over your nose and mouth. Wearing a mask can help filter out some of the smells.

 Once your kid arrives home, let them know that you are happy they are home. Simple gestures like cooking their favorite meal or cleaning their room for them before they get home will relay the message that you are happy they are home. Keeping the pantry and refrigerator stocked with food while your kid is home is also a nice gesture.Focusing on the positives will help set the tone for the rest of the summer. This way you can ensure that your summer is as smooth and relaxing as you imagined.
 It is highly likely that your kid has changed, at least a little bit, since they went off to college. Instead of criticizing their new lifestyle or identity choices, be accepting of them. And try to avoid bombarding them with tons of questions about their choices. Instead, wait for them to come to you to talk about these things.If you are uncomfortable with some changes, try to remember that some behaviors and attitudes last while others don’t. Unless it is something very serious, like drug use, it is not worth getting hung up on.
 It’s normal for your kid to want to spend time with their old friends. However, ask them to save some time for you as well. This way, you can get your much needed alone time with them before they head back to college.For example, plan a weekend trip with them to a favorite destination, or plan a trip to a waterpark or an amusement park.
If you or your kid do not have time for a trip, then make dinner plans once or twice a month, or catch a movie.

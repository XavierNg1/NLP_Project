 Whether you lightly dab a towel over melted chocolate or use the vacuum hose while scrapping off an old chocolate stain, remove as much chocolate as you can before applying any cleaning products. Do not spread the stain in haste., Depending on the severity of the stain and the type of upholstery, use an appropriate stain remover on the chocolate stain. For small stains mix one tablespoon of detergent with two cups of cold water. For more severe stains, use a dry-cleaning solvent.Check if your upholstery is able to withstand harsh chemicals before applying any dry-cleaning solvent or stain remover.
 Make sure the cloth is clean so as to prevent fourth staining of the upholstery. Blot the solvent until it is absorbed into the upholstery.You can also use a sponge instead of a white cloth but make sure it is clean.
 Continue to apply the cleaning solution and blot the stained upholstery with a clean white cloth until you can no longer remove any chocolate. Blot the upholstery until the stain disappears and is dry.

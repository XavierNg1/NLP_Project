 The piece of cardboard that comes inside calendars is ideal and does not need pre-cutting.;
, You can either pin it up using tape or sticky tack, or you can hold it if it isn't too difficult to hold and paint.
 Start at the top and work your way down the pipe towards the ground level.
 Move the piece of cardboard down and paint each new section until you finish painting the entire downpipe.
 The wall should be paint-free.

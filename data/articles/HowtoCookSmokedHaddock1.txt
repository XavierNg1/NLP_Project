 The size of the pan and the amount of milk will depend upon the quantity of fish you wish to cook at one time. The pan should be large enough to accommodate all of the filets with some room for your spatula, and there should be enough milk to just cover the filets.Alternatively, half heavy cream and half water may be used.
Do not use water alone, as it will pull the flavor out of the fish.;
, Grind fresh black pepper directly into the milk to give the haddock a little extra flavor boost. This is a good time to add other spices if desired. Other spices may include bay leaf, onion, garlic, parsley, or even dill.
 Do not boil the milk, but heat it to just before boiling. If the milk begins to boil over, remove it from the heat immediately until it settles. Once the milk has heated, reduce the heat to prevent boiling. , Place the fish in the nearly-boiling milk, arranging the fish filets around the pan and ensuring that they are covered in milk.
 Allow the fish to simmer in the milk for about 10 minutes on a medium heat. Alternatively, very small filets of fish may be cooked in milk that has been removed from the heat.To do this, remove the pan from the heat and cover it after the fish have been placed inside.
 When the fish are done, they will have become completely opaque, and the meat should flake apart easily. If the fish looks translucent or pieces do not come free with a gentle tug, cook the fish a bit longer.


Be sure to check the widest part of the largest fish filet for doneness. The tapered ends of smaller filets will be done more quickly than others.
 Poached smoked haddock, typically a British dish, is traditionally served with fresh baked bread and butter. The milk is strained off to use as a sauce, and the bread is used to mop up excess sauce off of your plate.


The haddock can also be flaked and used in other recipes such as fish pie or Kedgeree.

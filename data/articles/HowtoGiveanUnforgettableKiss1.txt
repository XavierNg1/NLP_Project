 To quote a song worth kissing to, “If you think that is a kiss is all in the lips, come on, you’ve got it all wrong.” The intensity of a kiss is determined by so much more than the kiss itself, and eye contact is where many kisses begin.Intentionally pause right before impact for a moment of pure and unadulterated eye contact.
A powerful moment of eye contact can actually be the breaking point of passion, pulling you in to one another for a kiss that is already unforgettable.
Break eye contact by looking at their lips. Let them know what you’re thinking about with your eyes.;
, This is harder than you think. The better the kiss, the worse your memory. That said, oxygen-deprivation is a far-too-common reason that kisses do not achieve their full potential.Make breathing breaks sexy by allowing your partner to feel your breath, though only barely.
Evince your nervous energy and excitement with flattering exhalations.
It’s a deeply gratifying feeling to literally take someone’s breath away. If someone takes yours, make sure they know it.
 The impact made the first time your lips meet someone else’s can be completely and incredibly disorienting. Allow gravity to fall away by letting your lips linger on your partner’s skin. Time and space will distort accordingly.That said, don’t hold back. Don’t feel as though you should hesitate and let your partner lead, unless this is what you want and have been clear about your desires. If you’re interested, act like it and initiate!
Immerse yourself fully in every kiss, but especially the first few times your lips touch one another’s. Allow yourself the freedom and enjoyment of fully enjoy another person’s affection.
When you pull away, your eyes will already be sharing exactly how you felt about the endeavor, and you’ll already have forgotten everything else about your day.

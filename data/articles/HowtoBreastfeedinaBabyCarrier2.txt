 If your baby likes to nurse in an upright position, a structured carrier may be the best choice for you. Pass your baby’s arms and legs through the openings and then, together with the stretcher, pull the carrier to your chest. Set the straps on your shoulders, and hold your baby with one hand while you fasten the carrier with the other.
 Loosen the straps until your baby is lowered to the desired height, with his or her head against your chest. Always hold onto your baby with one hand, and be sure to secure the carrier well after you adjust it.
 If you have a shirt with buttons, undo them until you can fit your breast through the hole; otherwise, you can simply lift your shirt above your breast. Remove your bra, or lift your breast over the bra cup.


Nursing bras can be tremendously helpful; they make it much easier to provide your baby access. However, normal bras will work; just lift your breast over the cup.
 Bring your breast to your baby’s mouth, holding with one hand until your baby is suckling securely.
 Hold your breast with one hand until your baby is suckling securely.
 If your carrier has head protection, use it. Otherwise, hold your baby’s head with one hand.
 If you are concerned about privacy or discretion, use your shirt to cover whatever parts you can. Be sure you give your baby room to breathe and nurse, though.

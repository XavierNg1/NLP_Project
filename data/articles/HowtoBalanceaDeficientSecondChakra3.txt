 Part of balancing your sacral chakra is intentionally removing any negative emotions, thoughts, or people from your life, and removing any regrets that youâ€™re holding on to.Holding on obsessively to negative memories and to negative people in your life will only weigh you down emotionally.Avoid this harmful baggage by practicing letting go of unhealthy emotions.
 Through a mutual respect and appreciation of creativity, you can foster deep and emotionally significant relationships in your personal life. Invest in people in your life who have healthy emotional commitments and enjoy creative expression.


Interpersonal and social connections are key to having a balanced sacral chakra.
 The sacral chakra is tied to sexuality and your sex drives, and promotes sexual expression and enjoyment. Affirm your own sexual nature and desires, and try new types of sexual activity that you (and your partner, if applicable) enjoy.When balancing your second chakra, try not to focus on having sexual encounters with a specific frequency. You can be open with yourself and embrace your sexuality even if you are temporarily (or permanently) chaste.

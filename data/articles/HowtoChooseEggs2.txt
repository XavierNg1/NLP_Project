 Generally, eggs are transported to stores in vehicles in which the ambient temperature doesn’t exceed 45°F (7°C). Keeping eggs refrigerated helps to prevent foodborne illness like salmonella.
 Take the time to open an egg carton and inspect the eggs for cracks or breakage. Salmonella tends to live on the exterior of the eggshell and can travel into the interior via cracks.
 Over time, the yolk begins to absorb water from the egg white. The egg white becomes thinner, losing some of its thickening and leavening abilities, and the yolk becomes flatter, larger and more easily broken. Eggs may be kept in your refrigerator for 3 to 5 weeks after you bring them home from the store, even if the sell-by date passes during that time.
 A shield bearing the USDA grade of the egg means that the egg has been examined and certified to meet strict quality standards. These eggs have not been previously packed and shipped, and they have not been doused in non-USDA-approved cleansers. USDA-grade eggs are coded to identify both the location where the eggs were packed and the day of the year when the eggs were packed.
 Grade AA eggs have thick, firm whites and high, round yolks. This grade of egg is virtually free of defects and is best for frying, poaching or other cooking applications where the appearance of the egg matters. However, most stores sell Grade A eggs. These eggs are the same quality as Grade AA except that the white is categorized as “reasonably” firm. Grade-B eggs are seldom found in retail stores because they are used to make liquid, frozen and dried egg products.
 The sizing of eggs is determined by their weight, not by their dimensions. Many recipes are very specific about the size of egg that should be used, particularly in baking. Large eggs are best for most applications.

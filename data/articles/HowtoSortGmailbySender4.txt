 This 3rd party extension will automatically sort through your emails for you, placing them in a separate tab where they are organized by sender. While third party apps like this always have a small measure of risk (there is no guarantee that your email information isn't being stored), most at-home users can feel safe downloading Sender Sort from the Google Store.Note that this for Google Chrome web browser, not Firefox, IE, or Safari. You will need the other workarounds if you want to do this on a browser other than Chrome.
 To make sure the extension takes hold, close everything out and restart it. Navigate to your Gmail through the link: http://mail.google.com/.
 If asked, be sure to give the app permission to access your emails, otherwise it won't have anything to sort for you.
 This may take some time, depending on how many emails you have backed up. Leave Gmail alone as it syncs with Sender Sort.
 This special tab will give place every sender alphabetically into a column, allowing you to reveal or hide all emails from that person. You have several options from this screen:



Archive All: Takes every message in Sender Sort and Archives it. This can be a great way to eliminate spam if you know that there are only unimportant messages left in Sender Sort.

Archive Group: Archives all emails from one person.

Move: Appears next to individual emails when you hover over them. Allows you to archive one message or apply a label., Gmail needs time to communicate with Sender Sort, so anything you archive may not appear archived for a minute or so. Just be patient. You can keep sorting as you wait without causing problems.

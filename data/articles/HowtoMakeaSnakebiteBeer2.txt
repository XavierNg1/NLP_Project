 A pint glass or beer flute works best, but any clear glass will be sufficient.
 Pour until the glass is between 2/3 and ¾ full with hard cider.
 The table spoon will help slow the flow of Guinness into the glass in order to create a layered effect between the hard cider and the Guinness.
 Pour the Guinness over the center of the tablespoon to help disperse the flow of Guinness over the hard cider.


Don’t pour too slowly or else it will flow alongside the can instead of on the spoon and into the glass.
Pour until the glass is full.
 Let the foam settle.
 Add more Guinness until the glass is full. Enjoy!

 It is important to see bullying for what it is and remember that it is a result of the bully’s weaknesses, not yours. Acknowledging this fact is helpful in breaking past the shame and embarrassment that can come from being bullied and deciding to get out of that situation. It is also important to remember that bullying occurs in many forms:


Physical (violence and destruction of someone’s property)VerbalPsychological or social(social exclusion or humiliation, spreading rumors, etc.)Electronic (cyber bullying), Whether you go to a parent, teacher, guidance counsellor or principal, telling someone you trust that you’re being bullied is a big step in overcoming the isolation that can come with it. Approach the discussion by saying something straightforward, like, "I am dealing with a bully and I would like someone to talk to."


When confiding in someone, be honest and provide all of the information you can about the situation (e.g. who is doing the bullying, what they are doing, when and where it occurs, and how it is affecting you).
If you do not feel comfortable talking about the bullying in person, write a detailed letter instead., Bullying sometimes involves the presence of third party bystanders, whose inaction allows the bullying to continue.Intervening, offering support to the victim, or seeking help from a teacher or administrator can stop the situation in its tracks. If you feel guilty about getting someone in trouble, remember that bullying has negative effects on the bully too, and can foreshadow destructive behaviour down the line.

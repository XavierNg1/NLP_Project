 A value proposition letter is more concerned with what value and benefits you can bring to the company, rather than your past accomplishments. It essentially allows you to sell yourself to the company by describing how you think your skills could benefit the company and make it profitable.


In a proposition letter, you essentially present yourself as a brand that will add value to the company you are applying to. This allows you to convey the fact that you understand the company’s problems, and are equipped to solve them.
 If your potential employer does not specifically request a cover letter, you can use this lack of a request to use a proposition letter instead.
 A targeted job search is when you are only applying to a specific company for a specific job because you know it is the job you want, and that you could be very successful at it.


Make sure to conduct thorough research of the company and the position, so that you can know exactly how to market yourself and show that you can fix the company’s problems, or pick up slack where necessary.
 Employers are usually interested to learn about what value you can bring to the company, regardless of your past work. Because your resume only discusses what you have done in the past, you need to use a proposition letter to discuss what you can do for the company in the future.


Through a proposition letter you can tactfully quantify your potential, and can demonstrate the benefits that you will bring to the company.

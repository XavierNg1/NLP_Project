 Which form do you prefer? Makashi? Soresu? Djem So? Something else? Particular forms work better with different lightsaber styles.;
, A short person would have real trouble wielding a lightclub. A strong person probably doesn't want to use a curved-hilt lightsaber. Certain lightsabers require certain physical traits to wield effectively.
 Pacifist Jedi were disapproving of weapons such as the saberstaff, calling them "more slaughter per swing". Sith, on the other hand, loved weapons like this. More aggressive people probably want lightsabers that do greater damage, and more pacifist people should choose sabers better suited to defense (funnily enough, a saberstaff fits both these requirements).
 Quarterstaff or bo staff training lends itself well to saberstaff wielding. Whip users can become lightwhip users. Ever practised with one of those batons that policemen (or stormtrooper TR-8R) use - the one with a handle sticking out of the side? Look no further than the guard shoto.

 Because trauma often results in hyper vigilance and alertness, you may want to practice relaxation every day for 30 minutes to cope with daily stressors. This can help you deal with stressors as they occur without letting them accumulate. Relaxation can also help you with anxiety, depression, and stabilizing your moods.If you don’t know where to start, try yoga, qi gong, or meditation. You can also listen to calming music, write in a journal, or take a daily walk with your dog.
 Connect to the present moment through your senses, especially if you’re feeling threatened. Mindfulness involves bringing focused and non-judgmental awareness to your experience. It can help a threatened mind or body come into a calm, non-reactive state. If you feel triggered by something, engage in some mindful practices to bring you back to the present moment.There are lots of ways to practice mindfulness. You can focus on one sense at a time (like listening intently or visually scanning the room in detail) or focus on your breathing.
 Though trauma is largely psychological, some physical interventions can help you get “unstuck.” Do something that requires full-body movements such as walking, running, swimming, or dancing. Notice the sensations in your body as you move and put your focus and awareness fully onto your body.Some sports to try that involve your full body and require concentration include boxing, rock climbing, and martial arts.
 While you’re healing, make sure you’re taking care of your body. Get plenty of sleep (7-9 hours each night), eat healthy foods, and live a healthy lifestyle. Keeping on top of your physical health can help you deal with stress and help with feelings of anxiety and depression.Stay away from alcohol and drugs as ways to cope. Prioritize your healing by staying committed to healthy living habits.

 After you get rid of thrush, it is important to do what you can to prevent it from coming back. This includes:


Brushing your teeth 2 to 3 times a day.
Replacing your toothbrush often, especially during a thrush outbreak.
Being sure to floss your teeth once a day.
 These products tend to upset the normal microorganism balance in your mouth. Remember that your body contains a host of good microorganisms that effectively serve to fight "bad" ones. Harming these may pave the way for the bad ones to take over.


Instead, you can use a saline solution to rinse your mouth. You can create a saline solution by stirring half a spoon of salt into a glass of warm water.
 It is important to see your dentist at least twice per year, and more often if you wear dentures or have diabetes or a weak immune system. A dentist may be able to spot a thrush outbreak, or possible outbreak, sooner than you will, leading to quicker treatment.
 Candida fungus thrives on sugar. To stop it from thriving, you should cut down on the amount of starches you eat. This includes beer, bread, soda, alcohol, most cereals and wine. These foods feed the fungus and can prolong the Candida infection.
 Smokers are more likely to develop oral thrush than non-smokers. If you smoke, then do what you can to quit. Talk to your doctor for information abut medications and other options to help you quit smoking.

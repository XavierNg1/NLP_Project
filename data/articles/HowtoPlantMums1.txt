 Hardy mums can last for several years if you plant them at the correct time of year and care for them properly. Theyâ€™ll put down deep roots that help them survive the winter and come back the following year and flower again. , Florist mums are less hardy than garden mums, and they are usually potted or planted in a garden bed with the intention of removing them once their blossoms are gone. They come in an amazing variety of colors and shapes, but unfortunately they won't live over the winter, no matter how well you take care of them. Florist mums include the following varieties: Pompom mums, one of the most common varieties, which are shaped like little balls.
Anemone mums, which have either one or two rows of petals around a center.
Daisy mums, which have a row of petals around a center, like daisies do.
Spider mums, which are less common, have long, droopy petals.
 Mums will bloom pretty much anywhere, but they do best in an area in full sunlight. This means the area where you plant your mums should get 5 to 6 hours of direct sun per day.Mums bloom based on the changes in sunlight as nights get longer and days get shorter, so try to avoid planting them near artificial light sources like street lights.
 Mums are actually pretty adverse to wet conditions, so choose an area to plant them that has good air circulation and is generally dry. This usually means a higher area of your yard.

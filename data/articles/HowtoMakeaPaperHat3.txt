 You should use a colorful piece of paper to make the hat more festive.
 To make a small hat, the length of the bottom of the hat should be 6 to 8 inches (15 - 20.5 cm) long (this is a good size for a birthday party hat). A medium hat should have a 9 to 10 inch (23-25.5 cm) base (this is a good size for a clown hat). A large hat should be 11 inches (28 cm) or more (for a wizard or witch hat).








If you do not have a compass, use a pencil tied to a piece of string.
 Make sure to follow along the pencil line you have created.
 It should have a point at the top and circular base at the bottom. Estimate how large the circular bottom should be by placing it on your head and adjusting the overlap of the two sides.









You can also lay the bottom against a flat surface and estimate what size you think would fit your head.
 Place it on your head to make sure it fits. If it is too small or large, take the staple out being careful not to rip the paper. Re-staple so that the hat fits better.
 Hold the edges together while the glue dries. Allow the glue to dry fully. You can remove the bottom staple once the glue has dried is so desired.
 Cut out designs from other construction paper and glue them onto the hat. Add sparkles or draw designs with markers. Glue a pom pom to the very top of the hat for a festive look.

 Your ear is very good at catching mistakes. Speak the sentence. If something sounds off, check the pronouns. You may not have written them correctly.
 Singular pronouns should take singular verb forms. Plural pronouns take plural verb forms. Double-check that the pronoun takes the same number value as its antecedent and that the proper verb is being used.



Each, either, neither, and one are always singular. That means that they take singular verbs.Who takes the value of its antecedent. If its antecedent is plural, then who is plural. If the antecedent is singular, who is singular.
 The sentence should have exactly the same meaning if you switch the pronoun with the antecedent. If you want to make sure that your usage is correct, try replacing the pronoun with its antecedent.
 The antecedent should be very close to the pronoun, ideally within the same sentence or the sentence immediately before it. If you cannot find the antecedent or the antecedent is far away from the pronoun, replace the pronoun with its antecedent., Take away all nouns, and replace them with just pronouns in the sentence. This can help you remove distracting words and identify errors more quickly.


For example, in the sentence "Dad snapped a photo of Mike and she," replace Dad, a photo, and Mike with he and it. You are left with "He snapped it of she." You may notice the error that a subject pronoun (she) is being used where an object pronoun (her) should be used. The sentence should read “Dad snapped a photo of Mike and her.”

, Sometimes, sentences leave out verbs that are understood in the meaning of the sentence. This often happens with “than” comparisons. Add these verbs back in to see if the pronoun is correct.


For example, in the sentence “He makes more money than she/her,” you can finish the sentence to find the correct pronoun. “He makes more money than she ” is more correct than “He makes more money than her .”

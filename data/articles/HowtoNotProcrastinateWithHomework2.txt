 Tell anyone who will listen you intend on finishing your homework by a specific time and ensure they hold you accountable. Assign a consequence (for you) and reward (for them) if the deadline is not met.


Tell friends to post an embarrassing story of you online if you don't finish on time.
Ask your mother to create a fair punishment for delaying.
Ask your father to concoct something even more devious if you don't finish after your mother's punishment.
 Write down on a piece of paper (or in a planner) what homework you have or what project needs to be finished while you are still in class. When you get home, start on it immediately! Touch the pencil to the paper or get your fingers on the home-keys. Getting started is the most difficult step.
 The homework would not be assigned if not applicable to your class. If second-guessing or a negative thought pops into your head, it's important to focus on the positive. Imagine your future self engaging in your favorite activity, feet kicked in the air, completely relaxed because of how quickly and correctly homework was finished!

, Write a title for the report? High five yourself. Finish the first paragraph? Maybe some candy is in order. Solve a complicated math problem after several failed attempts? Pat yourself on the back and take a quick break. Positive reinforcement can be very effective if used properly.

 Dark Valefor is the weakest among all the Dark Aeons, but that doesn’t mean that she’s a pushover. She has over 800,000 HP and can wipe out your entire party in 1 hit if you go in unprepared. To be prepared, you will need the following:


Fully upgraded Celestial weapons with Break Damage Limit for your party (Increases the damage you can deal from 9,999 to 99,999)
Break HP Limit (Raises your HP limit from 9,999 to 99,999)
Auto-Haste (Constant Haste effect that will give you more turns in battle)
Auto-Life (Skill on the Sphere Grid, not the same as Auto-Phoenix)
Auto-Phoenix (Automatically uses Phoenix Down on fallen party members)
Ribbon (Optional, provides protection against all status ailments)
Good Stats (Agility, Luck, Strength, and Defense)
X-Potions (For healing);
, To fight Dark Valefor, you need to go to Besaid (Yuna’s hometown).
 Travel to Besaid by choosing it from the list of places available on the airship.
 You will be blocked by a member of Yu Yevon, who will summon Dark Valefor.
 To begin, make sure that you have Wakka in your party.
 This should be done as soon as the battle begins.
 You can also use the skill Quick Hit (Sphere Grid skill) to attack Dark Valefor; each hit will still do 99,999 damage.


It’s recommended you use Tidus, Wakka, and Rikku for this method since they have the highest agility, making them attack faster and therefore have more turns.



Getting 2 hits on the reel mini-game takes some practice, but is highly worth mastering as it gives a high amount of damage boost.
If you get 2 hits, Wakka will attack with 12 hits; paired with the Break Damage Limit skill from his Celestial weapon, he will do a total of 1,199,988 to Dark Valefor, which will instantly kill her.
If you fail to get 2 hits on the reel, Wakka will only attack 6 times.

 Some brands, such as Catrice, make metallic eyeshadows that are labeled as "liquid metal eyeshadow." Despite the name, these eyeshadows can be applied just like any other eyeshadow. Here are some more tips on how you can increase the shimmer aspect:


Apply the eyeshadow using a clean finger. For some reason, metallic eyeshadows stick better to fingers than to brushes.
For a more metallic finish, apply the eyeshadow wet. Keep in mind that this largely depends on the brand.Apply the shadow dry first, blend it out, then apply it wet to areas that you want to stand out, such as the center of your eyelid., Some types of metallic eyeshadow come in actual liquid form. They are packaged much like lip gloss: in a plastic tube with a foam-tipped applicator. Simply use the flat part of the applicator to gently pat the eyeshadow all over your eyelid. Use the pointed tip to draw along your lash line at the end; this will give you a cleaner look.For a twist, use the pointed tip of the applicator to draw along your lash line, then sweep it upwards on the outer corner. This will give you an elegant, elongated look., Some brands, such as Illamasqua, make a metallic eyeshadow that they label "liquid metal." These types of eyeshadow can be applied like any other cream-based eyeshadow. Here are some pointers to keep in mind when applying cream-based "liquid metal" eyeshadow:Pat the eyeshadow onto your eyelid using the tip of your (clean) finger. Regular eyeshadow brushes don't work, because the eyeshadow is too thick. Foam-tipped brushes might work.
Pat on some translucent setting powder after you are one. This will set the look and prevent it from creasing and getting oily.
Avoid wearing cream-based eyeshadow if your eyelids tend to get oily. The cream base won't stick as well and be more likely to run.
Consider using an eyeshadow base or primer first if your eyeshadow tends to crease.

, Every ice cream maker will be a little different, so make sure that you follow the directions for your specific maker.


If you don't have an ice cream maker, transfer the ice cream to a freezer-safe container, and freeze for 6 to 8 hours. Stir it with a spoon every hour. Keep in mind that the ice cream won't be as creamy., Freezing the ice cream for 4 to 6 hours would be recommended, however.This allows the ice cream to "ripen." It will improve its texture and flavor.


If you are not using an ice cream maker, then you cam simply pull your ice cream after the initial freezing time.
 If it is too hard, let it soften for about 15 minutes on the counter. The ice cream will last 1 to 2 weeks in the freezer.

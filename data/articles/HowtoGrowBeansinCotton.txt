 Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) are the easiest to cultivate.
 They can be cultivated anywhere, but choosing an object such as a plastic cup or a plate will prevent accidents., The more seeds you want to cultivate, the more cotton that you will need. Do not soak the cotton, or the seeds will not grow. Place the cotton where you have decided to grow the plants., Burying or placing the seeds too closely next to each other will cause the sprouts to grow with difficulties, and may kill the struggling plant., In warm temperatures, do this every two days, and in cold temperatures, two times a week. After about three days, the sprouts will germinate., When the sprouts reaches about 20 centimeter (7.9 in), bury the cotton, along with the sprouts, in the soil.

 Before you go outside, warm your body slightly by stretching your arms and legs and torso. Athletes do this to prepare for playing in colder temperatures, while also preventing injuries during the event.Try not to stretch too much before you go outside. If you begin to sweat indoors, then it will feel colder when the cool air touches the sweat on your skin.
 A good way for a quick warm-up is a quick warm-up. When you're active, your body's blood circulation increases, which causes you to warm up.Here are some standing exercises to keep warm while outside:


High knee kicks. Place your hands in front of you and kick your knees up to your hands.
Jumping jacks.
Torso twists. Keeping your elbows lifted, twist your upper body from side to side at a moderate pace.
Dance. If the occasion calls for it, don't be afraid to dance to the music!

, Even if you're just wearing a t-shirt, keeping other parts of your body can warm your overall internal core. Blow hot air into cupped hands and rub them together.Outer extremities are the first to develop damage from cold temperatures. These consist of your toes, fingers, ears, and nose. Extremities don't have the muscle or blood flow to keep them as warm as the rest of your body.Keep these areas warm to avoid freezing injuries like frostbite.
 Hot coffee, tea or cocoa are excellent ways to warm your hands and taking sips of the warm liquid will warm your body. It will force you to move around in order to get the drink, and the caffeine and sugar will give you energy to keep moving. It's a win-win for staying active and keeping warm.

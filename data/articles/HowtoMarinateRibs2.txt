 Peel off the membrane from the back of the ribs to help the marinade.
 Heat them on medium heat on the stove to combine.
 Allow it to cool completely.
 This marinade recipe is for four lbs. of ribs.
 Turn them and ensure they are completely coated. If the marinade doesnâ€™t cover your rack, you will need to turn the ribs in the refrigerator every hour.
 Discard excess marinade. Lift the ribs from the container so that they can drip dry.


Allowing the ribs to dry a little is especially important if you are grilling them uncovered, since the wet marinade will cause flare-ups.
 Serve sesame seeds and green onions.

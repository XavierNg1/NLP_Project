 These reactions are similar to single replacement reactions except that both components react and there are two replacements. The general formula is AB + XY --> AY + XB. The cations and anions from both compounds recombine to form two new compounds.


These reactions are usually between acids and bases or metallic aqueous compounds.
For example: KOH + H2SO4 --> K2SO4 + H2O.
 When looking at an equation you can tell it is a double replacement reaction because the outside elements will recombine to make a new compound and the inside elements will recombine to make a new compound. The inside elements will switch position because the cation is always written first.For example: FeS + HCl --> FeCl2 + H2S.
The outside elements, Fe and Cl, combine to form FeCl2.
The inside elements, S and H, switch positions and combine to from H2S.
 Looking at many examples of a double replacement reaction will help you recognize them when you see them on a quiz or test. The more examples you look at, the better you will be at identifying them.Example 1: NaCl + AgNO3 → NaNO3 + AgCl
Example 2: H2SO4 + 2NaOH→ Na2SO4 + 2H2O

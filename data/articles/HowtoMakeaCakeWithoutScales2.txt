 Drizzle the maple syrup into the base of the non-stick loaf pan.
, In a large roomy saucepan (yes, that's right, saucepan), melt the butter and stir in the brown sugar. Keep stirring to combine.
 The objective is to melt the butter, not to cook it. Off the heat, keep stirring. The texture will go from a runny mix of melted butter with brown sugar solids to a thick creamy mixture, much like caramel.
 You'll see the mixture becomes smooth.
 Add the milk and stir to combine well.
 Pop the cake batter in the oven. Bake for 30 minutes till golden brown.
 The bottom with the glazed fruit is now at the top.

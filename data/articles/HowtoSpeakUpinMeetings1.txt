 Having some ideas about what you want to say already planned out can help you to feel more confident when you speak up in a meeting. Try jotting down a few ideas for questions you can ask or ideas you can bring up in the meeting. Use these notes to guide you when you are ready to speak up.;
, If you want to speak up yet somehow talk your way out of it, try being the first to say something. Speaking first means you have less time to censor yourself or doubt yourself. Make a point to jump in first and create discussion instead of delaying your comments.Say, “I’d like to start the discussion off by offering my ideas.”

, You don’t need to shout or talk over people to say something confidently. Make your words meaningful. Even if you don’t feel confident, show confidence in what you’re saying and how you’re saying it. Speak clearly and try to avoid fillers like “uh” or “um.”Don’t minimize your words or ideas by saying, “I don’t know, but…” or, “This might be stupid, but…” Even if you feel tentative, don’t show it., Think about what you can specifically relate or contribute to in the meeting. Perhaps you are younger than the others present but can comment on young adult markets or perspectives. Think about what unique perspective you bring, then share it.You might have a different family background, ethnic identity, or education than those around you. Use these to your benefit to add a new perspective.
 There’s no need to ramble on to make sure that you’re heard or that people understand you. Focus on speaking clearly and with fewer words. Make your comment memorable, not time-consuming. Take some time to formulate your thoughts and ideas, then say it in a clear and effective way.For example, skip filler words like “I think…” or, “I have an idea…” and get straight to the point.

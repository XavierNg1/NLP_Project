 Wear camouflage that matches your location. Like if you are in the woods, wear dark greens and browns. Be sure to wear sneakers. Grab a backpack to put all the stuff in.
, Be able to run fast, do rolls, climb, and jump. Do this with all your gear on as well.

Practice being stealthy.
 If you have a blade, learn to use it.
 A triad works too.


Practice with the Nerf jolt.






Practice quickly drawing the jolt.
 Remember your gear.
 Ask them what they want you to do. Don't argue with him or her, even if you hate the job they give you.
 Avoid contact with anyone. If you see enemies, keep quiet and don't let them see you. Keeping your mouth shut is the secret to becoming an amazing spy. Travel through heavy vegetation and stay on the walls. If you hear people, duck for cover.
 A wall, large rock, or tree are all good spots. If you need to hear the enemy, a spot ten feet away is good. When going to your position, don't get seen!

, Take of your backpack, get a drink or snack, and rest. If you're burning in the sun, now is a good time to take off your sweatshirt.
 Pull out your binoculars and watch the enemy. Listen to your enemy and write down good information. Stick around unless you have to be back at a certain time. You never know what you might learn.
 When you are ready, exit your location quietly. Attack the base from the unguarded side (or less guarded). Then start shooting. Keep under cover. Once the enemy is out of darts burst in with a blade and have the base surrender. Grab the plans and get the heck out of there!

, With the information you provided, your team might win the war!

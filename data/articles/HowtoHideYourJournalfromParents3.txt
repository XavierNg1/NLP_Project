 It could say Journal, or not. It's whatever you want.
 If it has a password, good, but if it doesn't download an app like "applock" to password protect it. This may not be a good idea though, as it may cause more suspicion.
 If your phone is capable of hiding apps, hide it, otherwise, you could move it to the SD card (if you have one) and in a worst case scenario, you could remove the SD card. Another idea would be to rename it and change the icon, there are apps that can do this.

You can add other easy to digest, bland foods (clear soup, crackers, etc.) to this diet.
It is important to note that if you are actively vomiting, stick to drinking clear liquids only. The BRAT diet is recommended only after about six hours without vomiting.
 Studies show that about 1 gram (0.04 oz) of ginger can effectively reduce nausea.Take up to one gram of ginger at a time, up to 4 grams per day. If you are pregnant, ask your doctor before taking ginger — the dosage for pregnancy ranges from 650mg to 1 gram, but should never exceed 1 gram. There are many ways to work ginger into your snacks, though none of them provide a high dose.

 Although there isn’t a scientific consensus on peppermint, there are some studies that show that it can effectively soothe nausea. Peppermint has been used for digestive problems such as heartburn and indigestion, and it may help stops spasms in the stomach that lead to vomiting. Peppermint-flavored candies such as Mentos or Tic-Tacs should be eaten in moderation, as sugary sweets can make nausea worse. Sugar-free peppermint gum is an option, but be careful — chewing brings a lot of air into the stomach and can cause bloating, worsening the nauseous sensations. If you’re still on a liquid diet, peppermint tea is a great option.

Sports drinks can be helpful, when modified. Vomiting can drain your body of both liquids and electrolytes such as potassium and sodium. Sports drinks contain both of these, and therefore seem an excellent choice for replenishing these. However, sports drinks are actually far more concentrated than necessary for dehydration, containing far more sugar than necessary and unhelpful chemicals such as artificial colors-all to market the drink rather than necessarily what is actually best for you. However, it is easy to dilute the average sports drink:
Cut the sports drink by half or quarter with water.
Or, for every portion of sports drink, have a portion of water. This may be helpful if a person is being a bit stubborn about drinking water, but the sugary water is appealing. , Although it is high in sugar, flat soda can be useful to a queasy stomach. To make a soda flat, put it in a Tupperware-like container, shake, let out the air, seal, and shake, until no more carbonation is left.

Cola has been used as an anti-nausea cure for a long time, even before the use of it in soft drinks.
Ginger ale containing real ginger, likewise, is a anti-nausea elixir.
 Although drinking liquids is important, there are some drinks that will make your nausea worse. Alcohol, caffeine, and carbonated beverages, for example, are not useful for nausea treatment, as they can further irritate the stomach.If your nausea is accompanied by diarrhea, avoid milk and other dairy products until you’ve recovered. The lactose in dairy is hard to digest, and will worsen or prolong the diarrhea./images/thumb/e/e6/Cure-Nausea-Step-12-Version-9.jpg/v4-550px-Cure-Nausea-Step-12-Version-9.jpg

 Split ends can make your hair look more dull, dry, and damaged. You either need a haircut once a month or once every two months depending on your hair length and condition.
 We all know we need to brush our hair to get it looking its best, but there's an art to brushing that many people overlook.


Avoid brushing wet hair. It's hard to do, but wait for your hair to dry out a bit before you bring the brush down on it. When you need to brush wet hair, use a wide-toothed brush with rounded tips. This will help cut down on split ends and reduce torn hair.
Don't rip your brush through snarls. If you don't have detangler spray, wet the area and apply lots of conditioner to work it through evenly. Sleeping with your hair in a bun or braid can make it easier to brush in the morning, and will control some of the frizz (if you have it). Brush gently and slowly work the tangles out.
Don't over-brush. Some people say that brushing your hair 100 times a day will help bring blood to your head and stimulate hair growth. There is no scientific evidence to suggest this is true.In fact, over-brushing can cause cuticle damage and breakage, unless you brush it when itâ€™s dry with a boar bristle brush.
 Eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, and other healthy nutrients and also drink lots of water. You are what you eat, in a way, and the same applies to your hair. Eat healthy if you want healthy hair. Also, eat lots of protein because it will help strengthen your hair, improving color and shine. This is because your hair is made of protein.

 Place the raspberries, sugar and lemon juice in a large saucepan. You may use fresh raspberries if they’re in season, or frozen raspberries, which are available year round and are picked and frozen at the peak of freshness. Stick with the minimum amount of sugar and lemon juice that the recipe recommends for now. More can be added to taste later if the puree turns out too tart or sweet.If you are using frozen raspberries, allow them to thaw enough to separate from one another or defrost them in the microwave before heating to make puree.;
, Turn on the stove to low-medium or medium heat and begin heating the raspberry mixture. The sugar will begin to melt and combine with the liquid from the raspberries and lemon juice, stewing the fruit. Cook for around 10 minutes or until the raspberries begin to break down and integrate with the liquid, stirring frequently.Cooking on too high a heat might cause the mixture to scorch.
Sugar in particular has a very low burning point. Make sure there is another liquid in the pan to dissolve the sugar so that it doesn’t burn as it melts.
 Position a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and pour the raspberry mixture over the top. The liquid will run through the strainer while the larger solids will be trapped. Use the back of a spoon to force the remaining fruit through the strainer until only the seeds are left. This method will result in a thick puree that contains some small chunks of the stewed raspberries., Chill the finished puree until it has had time to set up. The puree will thicken on its own as it sits. Take the puree out once it is ready to be used or served. You can also serve it warm as a topping for cakes, custards and ice cream, though it will be slightly thinner than puree that has been refrigerated.Raspberry puree will stay good in the refrigerator for a week or longer.
You also have the option of freezing the puree until you need it.

 Specialized makes an awesome fixed gear bike called the P Fix., but it's very expensive. Double the price of a Framed bike for example.


Cheaper fixies are fixed gear all the time, so you can't coast at all. You are just pedaling on one gear all the time. So going to be usable for tricks only.
More expensive Fixies let you go back and forth between fixed and freewheel.


, Bunny hop, and spin the handlebar.


Keep your eyes on the handlebars. Do not look at the ground.
Don't be pedaling fast. With a fixie you can do a barspin easier if you are hopping barely moving at all.

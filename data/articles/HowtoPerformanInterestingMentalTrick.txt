 It helps if they know you in some way. Siblings or friends are easy to perform on. Say 'Do you want to see a great trick?' or something like that. They should be interested because you have just said that, so they should say that they do want to see the trick. If they say they don't want to see it, just find another subject who does.;
, Their hands must be limp. Tell them to close their eyes.
 Tell them that not only is the bucket very heavy on its own but they are also holding it under a running tap. Tell them that the bucket is filling up with water and it's getting heavier ('and heavier and heavier.' It's because to say it like that because it emphasizes how heavy the bucket is actually getting for the subject.)

, Then tell them that attached to that string is a helium balloon (you can tell them what colour it is if you want to help them imagine it) and it's trying to float away and pulling their hand up with it. Tell them that the heavier the bucket gets from all the water going into it, the more the balloon will try to float away and pull their hand up with it.
 If this person has a good imagination, and you have done this trick correctly, you should see their left arm droop downwards from the weight of the bucket and their right arm drift upwards from the 'balloon' trying to float away.
 If they haven't noticed the effect of this (most people notice the effect while their eyes are closed,) tell them to open their eyes and look at their arms. They should be amazed, or even freaked out by this trick.

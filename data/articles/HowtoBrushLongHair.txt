 Long hair is best brushed with a paddle brush. Choose one with the largest head you are comfortable using, with a rubber cushion. This rubber cushion will help reduce the amount of static build up.


Use a brush with natural bristles if you have fine to medium textured hair. Use a mixture of natural and synthetic bristles for coarse hair.
Keep your brushes clean.;
, Don't use too much though, or you'll do more harm than good.
 Make sure its even.
 Using a wide tooth comb to remove tangles is gentler on your hair than a brush. Comb a small section at a time, starting from the ends. Comb until it is tangle free, then move up a few inches and start over.
 Remember to brush from the top and from underneath.

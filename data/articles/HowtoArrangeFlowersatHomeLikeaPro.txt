 Add cut flower food if you have it. If you don't have it, use a spoonful of sugar, a teaspoon of lemon juice, and a few drops of bleach.
 Clippers or a sharp knife should be used to cut stems diagonally. Scissors will crush the stems and lessen the amount of water they can drink up. Well cut stems will ensure the freshness of the flowers for a longer time.
 Leaves etc will decay under the water and contaminate the water making it less beneficial to the rest of the flowers.
 A small rubber-band or ponytail holder can be used to keep the flowers from settling out of their arrangement. The band should to be tied close to the stems keeping flowers securely in place.
 Some flowers will drink up more water than others. Make sure you add water to your vase when needed. Better yet, change the water and give the stems a fresh cut.
 In the absence of flower food sugar gives nourishment, a few drops of bleach will kill off bacteria, and lemon juice will regulate the PH, resulting in a longer vase life for your flowers.



Wash the vase.
Add tepid water with sugar, lemon juice, and bleach.
Diagonally cut an inch or two off the bottom of the stems.

 You may be hesitant to use glitter on a dress or suit, as this can steal the show. A good way to incorporate glitter in a subtle fashion is to wear glitter shoes. These can add glitter to your wedding outfit without dominating it.You can have shoes that are completely covered in glitter. However, if this is too much for you, you can also simply have shoes with glitter on small parts, such as glittered toes.
If you need to add a certain color to your wedding outfit, use the glitter on the shoes to do so. For example, if you want to add the "something blue" from the saying, "something old, something new...", you can opt for shoes that use blue glitter.
 If you don't want to dress in glitter yourself, allow the wedding party to dress in glitters. Bridesmaids, groomsmen, and other members of the wedding party can wear a little glitter.You can opt for glittery bridesmaids dresses. You can also have groomsmen wear glittery ties or shoes.
If you have a flower girl or ring bearer, add glitter to their outfits.
 You may not want a full-on glitter look for your wedding outfit. This may be overwhelming. However, try adding small touches of glitter here and there. This nods to the glitter theme without dominating your look too much.For example, have some glitter on the sleeves of your dress or near the edges.
If you're wearing a suit, add a glittery pocket handkerchief or have a glittery tie.
 The mother or father of the bride can wear glitter on your big day. If your parents do not mind the glittery look, ask if they'd be willing to add a little glitter to their outfit. This will provide a small splash of glitter to your wedding party.

 As moisture causes most lumping in your powdered food, adding a moisture absorber, like dried rice or beans, to your mix prevents lumps from ever happening. Rice and beans are also relatively large, which means they'll be easy to pick out or can be caught easily in a shaker or strainer and separated from your food powder.


While rice and beans are common moisture absorbers, many other things might be used, like unpopped popcorn., You don't have to wait until lumps have formed to start sifting. Sifting aerates your food powder, releasing moisture that may be trapped inside it. Sifting your powdered food monthly and returning it to a clean, dry, airtight container will reduce occurrences of lumping.If your powdered food has not started lumping yet, simply passing it through a fine mesh strainer and into a fresh, dry, airtight container should help keep it lumpless.
 Cooking food in a pan usually gives off steam, and steam is a form of moisture in the air. This moisture can rise from your pan to your shaker/container and get trapped there, creating future lumps.


To prevent this from happening, you may want to first put your food powder in your hand or a spoon and then sprinkle it onto the food you are preparing.

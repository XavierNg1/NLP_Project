 There are essentially two forms of Google Books: the Google Books search engine and online reader, and the Google Play Books store. The link between the two is minimal, but all purchased books will be in your Google Play Books library. Regardless of which service you are using, you can only download books that you have purchased, or books that are freely available.

You cannot download any book in Preview mode. This view allows you to read selected pages from a book before buying, usually as a way to ensure that the conversion to eBook format is suitable. If the book has pages omitted, it cannot be downloaded.

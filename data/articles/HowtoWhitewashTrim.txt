For this method, fill a plastic bucket 2 inches (5.1Â cm) with an oil based wood stain in a light toned shade. Mix in 2 tbs. white titanium dioxide. Stir in 1 tbs. of aluminum powder, and mix well.

 Let the stain penetrate for about 15 minutes. Wipe it off with soft rag, going against the grain for oak and with the grain of the wood for other woods.
 Brush on a clear matte water based sealer, such as acrylic, over the whitewashed wood.

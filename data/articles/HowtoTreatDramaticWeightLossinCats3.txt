 It’s always best to discuss any dietary changes with a vet. You’ll both need to consider your cat’s age, activity level, allergies, and any existing health conditions. Even if the vet can’t identify any underlying conditions, they will help you create a diet that can increase your cat’s weight in the healthiest way possible., Protein consumption is essential to maintaining proper body weight, especially if your cat is age eight or older. While you should ask the vet about your cat’s specific protein needs, a general rule of thumb is to feed it at least six to eight grams of protein per day.Check the label of your cat’s food. It should consist of at least 50 percent animal protein. You might need to switch to a premium brand that consists of animal protein instead of plant protein.
 If your cat doesn’t have an underlying condition but has a low appetite, it might not like its food. Try adding a bit of canned tuna or fish oil to enhance its flavor. Warming food can also make it more appetizing.Be sure to consult the vet to make sure they approve of any flavor enhancers.
 Treats can be an effective means of adding calories to your cat’s diet. Go for an animal protein based cat treat. While vets recommend limiting treats to 10 to 15 percent of a healthy cat’s daily caloric intake, you should ask your cat’s vet to help you determine the right number of daily treats to offer your underweight cat.

Avoid using raw meat as a treat, since it can carry parasites and infectious diseases.

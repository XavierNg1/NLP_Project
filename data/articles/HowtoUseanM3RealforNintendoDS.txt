 This guide is mainly for those who do not have this CD.;
, There should be a card reader with a USB key on the end. Put the Micro SD card in the reader. Be careful not to break it! Turn on your computer, then stick the card reader containing the card into the USB port.
 Scroll down to find the button that reads "Open to View Files." The details of the Micro SD card will be displayed. Use the "Up One Level" button in the window. This should take you to "My Computer."

, Rename this "M3 REAL" and go back into it. Create a folder called NDS (save this for later).
 (Note: On the actual M3 website the system files are wrong!)

, Then, use an extraction program to unzip the files.


If you can't do that, don't worry! Go into the zipped folder and copy all of the files and folders. Create a standard folder called "system2" and put them in there. Then, go back, delete the zipped folder, and rename the folder from "system2" to "System". Be sure to get this right, or it will not work!

, Go back to the web and find M3 Real PDA files and save them to the M3 Real card. Then unzip or copy and paste the files into a standard folder. The M3 Real cannot read zipped folders.
 Place your files (e.g., MP3s) into the corresponding folder.

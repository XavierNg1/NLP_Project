 A lack of sunlight will prevent irises from blooming to their full potential. These plants require at least four to six hours of direct sunlight each day.Most varieties prefer six to eight hours of sunlight.
 If your irises are planted in a shady place, move them to a sunnier location in late summer. Make sure the soil at the new location drains quickly.
 Sufficient moisture is necessary to get irises to bloom but irrigation frequency depends primarily on the iris species.


Reticulated irises (Iris reticulata), for example, should be watered once per week or so if it does not rain in the spring but only once every few weeks throughout the summer months.
German irises (Iris germanica) should be watered when the top of the soil begins to dry out. This should be done throughout the growing season.
Southern blue flag irises (Iris virginica) require constantly moist soil and actually thrive in sandy-bottom bogs.
 Adjust the watering schedule according to your specific iris's needs.


Always water irises in the morning so that the moisture will be available to them during the heat of the day.

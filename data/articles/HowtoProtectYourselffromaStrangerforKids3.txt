 Just say no and never, ever get into a car with a stranger, no matter what they say. Ignore them and run as fast as you can to your parents or someone you know.


Be wary of candy or anything edible offered by a stranger. Food offered by strangers may not be wrapped, which possibly gives a red flag that toxic ingredients were added.

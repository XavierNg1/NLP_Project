 Mindfulness requires attention to the present moment. At the same time, this practice helps you develop a non-judgmental awareness of your thoughts and feelings. Carve out a few minutes each day to sit in total silence and breathe. You’ll be amazed at how this experience opens your mind up to new possibilities.If meditation is intimidating or difficult for you, then try starting out with a guided meditation. These are recordings that can help you to get into a state of deep relaxation without total silence. There are many guided meditations available for free online.
 Reflection is a powerful way to expand your way of thinking. By starting a journal practice, you can release any frustrations you have and evaluate your progress at the same time. Look for patterns in your thoughts and behaviors. Pay attention to a fixed mindset voice. When you notice it, challenge it with a growth mindset action.For instance, you may write “Jeffrey keeps trying to offer his input on the project. I told him that I’ll figure it out.” This stubborn resistance to feedback could be limiting your growth and success.
 You can expand your mental flexibility by purposely trying something new, which includes exposing yourself to new people, different belief systems, and different ways of thinking and doing things. At the same time, as you try new things, you will also increase your capacity to think creatively and solve problems.Pick up a new type of coffee or tea at the market. Read a book from a different genre. Join a new club, organization, or Meetup. Sign up for a cooking or dance class.
 Structure and routine help you feel safe and comfortable, but they do nothing for mental flexibility. Shake up your life with novelty by making slight tweaks to your normal routine.Brush your teeth with a different hand. Go to a different deli for lunch. Cut your TV time for a week and find other ways to entertain yourself.

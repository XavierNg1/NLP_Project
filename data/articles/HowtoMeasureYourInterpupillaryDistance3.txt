 Having your PD measured by an eye doctor will typically require an appointment. While you're there, your eye doctor will most likely want to test your vision to make sure that your optical prescription is up to date. This may include testing your eye muscles, visual acuity, visual field, as well as a refraction and retinal exam.If you do not yet have an eye doctor, you can find one in your area by searching online or checking your local phone book.
If you've had your vision tested within the last year, you shouldn't need a new vision exam. The eye doctor who performed your vision test may also have your PD in your chart from the previous exam.
 Depending on the tests you have done, your doctor may decide to check the size of your pupils using a digital pupillometer.Your eye doctor may also choose to use an ocular measurement device.Both of these handheld devices can measure the size of your pupil and the distance between your pupils.


A pupillometer looks like a large pair of binoculars, and all you need to do is look through the lenses while your doctor takes your measurements.An ocular measurement device may look like a digital camera, depending on the make and model used by your doctor.
 The advantage of having an eye doctor measure your PD is that you will leave with both an accurate measurement and a valid prescription for your next pair of eyeglasses. Many online retailers require your PD and a prescription in order to sell you glasses, so having an up-to-date eye exam will simplify the process and ensure that you have the right prescription for your eyes.

 This is the true view of what is happening in this puzzle.,
The end view in the first instance is indicated by 3, 4, 5 and 6, and it measures 17⁄8 ins. square. A 17⁄8-ins. square is simply used because 2-ins. wood generally finishes this size after it is planed up.
 This should stand corner-ways in the larger square (3, 4, 5, 6)., On to this drawing (1), set out the dovetail according to your own idea of length, width and bevel., Where these lines cut A, B, and D, C, draw them downwards and rebate them into your original plan. This will give the true shape of the two dovetails and it is to this shape that you must cut your joint.,, Once the glue has dried, plane and waste off the four corners of your model. The end view shows one corner shaded D, 3, A; this and the other three corners are wasted away. The result is that the dovetails are thrown into a plane different from that in which they were made., The length is not affected. Obtain a piece of wood that is larger in width and thickness by about a third. E.g., if your puzzle is to be 2" (50mm) square (in section) then start with a piece of wood 3" (75mm) in section.
 Assemble and when glue has set, mark a line from end to end down the middle of each side and cut the corners off along these lines. Sand smooth.

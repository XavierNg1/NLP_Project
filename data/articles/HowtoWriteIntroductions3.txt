 As mentioned above, your hook can pretty much be whatever you want it to — especially in a personal essay — as long as it sets the scene and touches on what the essay is going to be about. You might find some of the following hooks to be profitable starting points or examples to you in your introduction:


"I was walking down our driveway when disaster struck."
"Though she wouldn't know it at the time, my mother was poised to make a far-reaching political statement on the morning of June 4th, 1976, without even saying a word."
"I've made a few mistakes in my young life, but none of them ended up teaching me as much as when I first disobeyed the law."

, Personal essays are powerful because we share information in them that often isn't shared. This can be anything from a phobia to a love affair. Don't be afraid to provide that sort of information in your intro if it has to do with the story you're telling. Without sharing too much, give your side of the story while staying true to what happened and being honest. Remember to cite any information that you use to a website.
 Although your introduction might contain a thesis of sorts, it won't ever look like a thesis you put into an expository essay or an argumentative essay. And that's okay. Your personal essay introduction may just be a story, or an explanation of events. As long as it helps tell your story, or gives some helpful background information that will play a part in the story later, your introduction does not need to contain a traditional thesis.

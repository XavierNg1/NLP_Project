 Depending on how the tags are placed, either use a razor blade to lift tag stickers or you can cut away the area of the package that contains the sticker. Using a black Sharpie marker to black out the price may also be a solution.
 In some cases you may want to remove the item and allow it to free-float inside the jar. For example, a screwdriver or mini hammer can be removed from the packaging to accommodate for space.
 Thereâ€™s no special way to do this, however make sure everything fits comfortably, leaving space for the special item to be positioned toward the front/outside of the container.


When positioning special item, slide it in last and make sure you can see it after everything is in place.
 If you are using a standard lid, just screw lid on and add a ribbon.


Consider including a gift tag along with the ribbon. This can include a special message from you and/or a list of items inside the container.

 The items you need are: a bronze (or higher) hatchet, tinderbox, and bronze (or higher) dagger, which is optional. You can get these all for free! Go to Bob's Axes in Lumbridge. He will give you a free bronze hatchet. For the dagger and tinderbox, go to the general store in Lumbridge. You will get both free.;
, Equip your dagger and choose your attack style. Go to the chicken and sheep farm in Lumbridge. Start killing chickens in the chicken pen, which can be found by the farmer's house. There are usually 3-6 chickens there. The chickens are level 1 combat, so they shouldn't be a challenge.
 The chickens might not drop a lot of stuff each, but together, they're better (drop-wise). The feathers sell at the Grand Exchange for 15 gold each. You can cook the chicken meat, but you'll do that later. Bury the bones to level your Prayer. Don't collect the eggs because they take up too much space in your inventory.
 After you have a full inventory, minus one space, you can either kill chickens for their feathers or cook the meat to level you Cooking skill. To cook the meat quickly and easily, walk/run to the nearby tree to the west, and chop/cut it down with your hatchet.
 Do this by clicking on the tinderbox and then on the logs, or clicking on the logs and then on the tinderbox.
 Click on one of your raw chicken meats, and click on the fire. When the "What would you like to cook" question comes up, right-click on the chicken meat and select "Cook All".

 Drop it by right-clicking on one and selecting "Drop Burned Meat". Your avatar will drop the burned meat.

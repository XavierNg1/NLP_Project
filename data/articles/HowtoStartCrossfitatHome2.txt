 If you want to start CrossFit at home, the CrossFit website, available at https://www.CrossFit.com, will help you become familiar with the CrossFit system and the workouts available.If you've already attended classes at a CrossFit box, you may already be familiar with the website. There are resources there that can help you set up a home gym.
 The CrossFit website contains a number of videos so you can learn the correct form for the various movements you'll commonly encounter in CrossFit workouts.If you've never done CrossFit before, keep in mind that form is extremely important. Because of the speed with which you'll do these exercises, incorrect form will greatly increase your risk of injury.
 Form and technique are crucial when you're doing CrossFit. You can learn correct form on the website, but you may want to have someone watch you as you complete movements and critique your form., Especially if you don't have a lot of equipment at home, bodyweight circuits are the easiest way to start CrossFit at home. These circuits typically can be done anywhere, and don't require anything other than a little bit of floorspace.The other benefit of bodyweight circuits, especially if you're just starting out, is that they typically consist of exercises with which you're already familiar, such as Burpees, squats, and sit-ups.
Most bodyweight circuits are timed, interval-style workouts in which you do as many repetitions of the prescribed exercise as you can during the time allotted.
 All CrossFit workouts are designed to be modified to suit your individual fitness level. For example, if you want to do the Cindy, which is a timed body-weight WOD, but you aren't yet fit enough to go for the full 20 minutes, you can cut the workout to 10 minutes and do a Half Cindy., The CrossFit WOD is posted on the CrossFit website. Coaches at individual CrossFit boxes also may have their own WODs posted on their websites, so if you have a local box you like, you also might check there.Using a local WOD may be beneficial to you if there's a local box that more closely matches the fitness goals you've set, or if you plan on attending classes at that box in the future and want to get familiar with the coach's style.

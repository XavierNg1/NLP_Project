 Moles are water creatures, and they particularly love to move into lawns that are well-watered. Damp lawns have more worms, which moles eat, and wet soil is easier for the moles to move through. If you have your sprinkler on day in and day out, you're creating the ideal habitat for moles. Try watering it once a week to make it less hospitable for the furry creatures.
 Grass needs to be watered consistently, and earthworms love burrowing beneath it, so grassy lawns typically draw a lot of moles. If you replace your grass with cacti, moss, or another low-water groundcover, you'll save on water bills and make your yard less appealing to moles.


Choose plants native to your area that don't require a lot of watering.You can also plant trees and surround them with gravel, dirt, or appropriate groundcover.
 This is a time-consuming method for getting rid of moles, but many say it really works. Every day, go outside and tamp down the hills with your feet. You can also use a lawn roller to do the same job. Moles will push the hills back up every time you do this for the first few weeks. Eventually, though, you'll tire them out and they'll start digging their tunnels deeper and stop pushing up your grass.
 Poisons, human hair, fumigation, and sound wave machines have not been proven to effectively get rid of moles.Don't waste the time and money required to try to implement these methods, among the many others that frustrated gardeners have attempted.
 Moles aerate yards and eat a lot of insects, making your yard healthier in the long run. If you can stand looking at the tiny volcanoes erupting across your lawn, consider coexisting instead of trying to kill the mole. Moles only live for about 3 years, so eventually the problem will take care of itself.

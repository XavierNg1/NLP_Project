 Sneakers are gaining a growing following as fashionable options to less comfortable shoes. This doesn’t mean you should wear your old, dirty, or smelly gym shoes with a skirt or suit. Set aside your gym shoes for workouts and procure some new kicks for your more stylish endeavors. These can include running, tennis, or cross training shoes, but just make sure they aren’t the ones you ran a marathon in last weekend.
 One of the most common fashion slip-ups is a pair of socks peeking up from a set of styling sneakers. Go sockless if you can, as this will keep your look streamlined and on trend. If you can’t fathom sporting your sneakers without socks, try a pair of “invisible” socks that fit neatly below your shoe line.If skipping socks isn’t your thing, you can try adding a pair of statement socks instead.
 You’ll stretch the ways you can wear your sneakers outside the gym if you stick to classic looks and patterns or solid colors. Canvas slides in a classic leopard print or sneakers in a solid color with a retro vibe will go a lot further than kicks with crazy colors or patterns., When you head out to snag a new pair of sneakers, keep your closet in mind. Think about the types of outfits you plan on wearing with your new kicks. Opt for a pair that can serve multiple purposes and fits within your budget and style needs.

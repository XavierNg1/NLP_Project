 Start by talking to the adult team, to see if anybody is interested in coaching or helping you make a team. They will most likely be very interested, but if you can't find a player who's able to coach, try talking to a referee instead., Even if you only get one recruit in the first few months, every team has to start somewhere and yours will grow.,Â Next, you'll need a place to actually practice roller derby. Again, go to the adult team and see where they practice. However, if that space isn't available to you, try asking at your local ice-skating rink, gym, or school. Most of these places would be willing to let you practice in their space for a fee, and some may even want to become your sponsor., Even if your team is small or nonexistent in the beginning, keep talking to people, and keep advertising. You'll find more coaches and players as long as you keep with it, and sometimes just talking to the people at your school is the first step.

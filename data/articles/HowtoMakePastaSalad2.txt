 The bowl needs to be large enough to fit the rest of your ingredients.;
, Wash all of your vegetables. Next, prepare your ingredients in the following ways:


De-seed and dice 1 red bell pepper into tiny pieces.
Cut 1 cucumber in half. Cut each half into thin slices.
If you want to add some protein, cut some ham into small, bite-sized cubes. You will need about 1 cup (grams).
 If you want to add any cheese, you might want to save that for later. Cheese tends to get soggy the longer it sits in a salad, so it is best to add it just when you are ready to serve it.
 You will need about 1/3 to Â½ cup (80 to 120 milliliters) of Italian salad dressing. Gently toss the salad with some salad tongs. Be careful not to break the pasta noodles.
 This will allow all of the flavors to blend together.
 Be sure to give the salad a final toss, in case some of the ingredients sank to the bottom.

 Magic erasers are a popular type of household cleaning product made from melamine foam. Although a fairly new cleaner, magic erasers have become quite common and can usually be found at your local grocery store. Use a magic eraser when you want to clean the whole surface of the ball quickly.


Magic erasers are especially effective for removing all types of stains from white leather. However, keep in mind that also includes ink stains. Don't use a magic eraser on an autographed ball., Run your eraser under the tap and squeeze to remove excess water. While magic erasers can also be used dry, they are more effective with some moisture. Water makes it easier for dirt to cling to in the same way that a wet paper towel is a much more effective cleaning tool compared to a dry one.You may also choose to cut your magic eraser into multiple pieces with a pair of scissors. You'll increase its surface area, getting more use for your money. The smaller size will also be easier to grip while working on a small object like a baseball., Melamine foam is a soft material with an extremely hard microstructure that works as an abrasive cleaner. In other words, magic erasers clean surfaces in a manner similar to a sander, directly scraping away dirt and grime with friction. Because magic erasers don't hold their shape, you will need to both grip yours securely and press down fairly hard. From there, make a few back-and-forth motions as you would erase pencil from paper. It should lift the stain fairly quickly, needing only a few passes to work its "magic.", Turn the ball in your hand and continue to rub until the entire surface is clean.


Avoid rubbing the stitching on the seams of the ball too much, as you don't want to damage or fray them. Frayed seams will ruin the look and durability of the ball. Remember that melamine foam cleans through abrasion. While it shouldn't harm the leather of the main part of your ball, the thinner cotton stitching can be more prone to damage.

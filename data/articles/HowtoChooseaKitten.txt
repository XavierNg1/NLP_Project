 If you wanted more of a sleek, graceful kitten that's more for show, then search more for this. But if you wanted an interactive, playful kitten search for them! Also choose if kitty is to be an indoor kitty (safer, but can be more boring for kitty - also enables chance of taking kitty for walks with you!), or an outdoor kitty (more dangerous for kitty; toxins, cars, roads, bad people, pound!, but can be more fun for kitty.), both are good choices, but be sure once settled on one, so as not to regret it in future!;
, This will enable you to determine the characteristics of each kitten.
 Ask about medical records and vaccinations.
 Make sure that he or she likes you.
 If the cat squirms, and tries to wriggle out of your grasp, let it go and carry on with your search - but be careful not to confuse this with the cat being scared of you, as earlier mentioned! But if the cat stays with you, and seemingly wants to play, then definitely put this cat on the consideration list. Do not go straight with this cat though, as there may be other cats even more suited to you!

, Be sure to schedule a checkup at your local vet clinic.

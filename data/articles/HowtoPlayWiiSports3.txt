 Knowing exactly when to bat can take some practice, but once you get the hang of it you don't forget it.
 That way, you don't get a strike or hit an easy out.
, To throw a fastball, flick the Wii® Remote. To throw a curveball, hold B. To throw a screwball, press A. To throw a Splitter press A and B., There are several combinations of pitches you can perform, but the basic one is just a swing of the remote. See the "Tips" section for some pitching styles.
 If you flick the Wii remote instead of swinging it, it'll go a lot faster. :)

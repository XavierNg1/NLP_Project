 Make sure to get the front and back, and note any holographic elements.;
, Photoshop would be ideal for this, but you can also use free programs like GIMP and Paint.net.
 Try to get a photo that's roughly the same resolution and size as the one on the valid ID.


Zoom in or out of the new photo so that the head will be about the same size as in the original photo.
You can also adjust the contrast and brightness to match the original photo. As long as the new pic isn't too bright or too dark, you're probably fine.
 Try to find a font that's close to the one on the current ID. (Courier, with slab serif, was used on a lot of older licenses.) Also, adjust the font size and spacing so that it matches as closely as possible.


Enter a full name, without abbreviations. The only instance in which you might use an abbreviation is for things like "Albert Smith Jr." or "Thomas Jones III."
Put in a realistic birth date. If you're using a particularly old ID as a template, you don't want to keep it so that it says the new person was born in 1951 but looks 20.
Match the hair and eye color fields to the photo. See below for a list of abbreviations.
 Be sure to print both the front and back.
, Trim any overlapping edges.
 If you'd like to add an extra layer of authenticity to the ID, you can add a hologram. See the Making Your Own Hologram section below for more help, and be sure you do it before you laminate the ID.
 Trim the laminate so it's about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the edge of the paper.

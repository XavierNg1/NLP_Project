In this guide we will create a database called "secure_sessions".
See how to Create-a-Database-in-Phpmyadmin.
Or you can use the SQL code below will create one for you.Create Database Code:




CREATE DATABASE `secure_sessions` ;





Note: Some hosting services don't allow you to create a database through phpMyAdmin, Learn how to do it in cPanel.;
,
This means that if there was ever a breach of security in our script the hacker couldn't drop tables from our database. If you're really paranoid, create a different user for each function.

User: "sec_user"

Password: "eKcGZr59zAa2BEWU"

Create User Code:




CREATE USER 'sec_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'eKcGZr59zAa2BEWU';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON `secure_sessions`.* TO 'sec_user'@'localhost';





Note: It is a good idea to change the password in the code above when running on your own server. (Make sure you change your PHP code also.) Remember it doesn't need to be a password that you can remember so make is as complicated as possible. Here's a random password generator.

The code below creates a table with 4 fields (id, set_time, data, session_key).Create the "sessions" table:




CREATE TABLE `sessions` (
  `id` CHAR(128) NOT NULL,
  `set_time` CHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  `data` text NOT NULL,
  `session_key` CHAR(128) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;





We use the CHAR datatype for fields we know the length of, as the fields "id" and "session_key" will always be 128 characters long. Using CHAR here saves on processing power.

 This can be done by selecting the Apple icon in the upper left-hand side of your screen or by clicking on the silver icon that resembles a cog from your task bar.
 This should be in the second row of icons.
 Under the tab entitled ""Input Sources," tick the box next to "Show input menu in input bar" at the bottom of the window.
 Make sure to place your cursor where you want to input a musical symbol.
 This can be found in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar and resembles the Command symbol on your keyboard. If it does not appear, go back and make sure you have selected the "Show input menu" box in System Preferences.
 This will prompt a window to appear where you can search for "Musical Symbols" and highlight your choice from the given options.
 Once you have highlighted the symbol, drag it to where you would like to place it in your text.

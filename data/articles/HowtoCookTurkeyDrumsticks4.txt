 Make sure it's big enough to comfortably hold all of the drumsticks you want to cook.
 Fill the pot to within a few inches of the top of the rim, rather than right up to the edge. The drumsticks should be completely submerged., Add a teaspoon of salt, a half teaspoon of pepper, and any other seasonings you desire. The seasoned water will penetrate the turkey meat to flavor it as it cooks.
 Bring the liquid to a rolling boil, then reduce it slightly to a low boil that won't splash. After an hour, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat. The turkey legs are ready when the internal temperature reaches 180ºF/82ºC.
 Pour them over a colander to drain out the water, then let the meat cool for about ten minutes before you try to handle it.
 Be careful to make sure small bones are removed. Use the meat to make barbecue, soup, or a casserole.

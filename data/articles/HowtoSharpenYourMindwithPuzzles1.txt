 Activities need to challenge you to stimulate your mind and build new connections in your brain.To ensure that you are doing puzzles that are challenging, try picking out a puzzle book one level higher than you usually do.


For example, if you usually go for beginner level, then grab an intermediate level puzzle book.;
, Things that you already know how to do will not challenge your brain.That is why it is better to try new activities and this may include a new type of puzzle.


For example, if you usually do crossword puzzles, then try doing a Sudoku puzzle or an anagram puzzle.
 If a task does not hold your interest, then you will have a hard time staying focused on it and this will not exercise your brain as much.Try to select puzzles that you want to do. Don’t choose a type of puzzle that seems boring or tedious.


For example, if you despise Sudoku puzzles or find crosswords boring, then don’t do these types of puzzles. Stick with the ones that you like.
 To sharpen your mind, it is often necessary to build upon existing skills.Therefore you might need to start off with a somewhat easy puzzle when you are first learning how to do them, and then work up as you get the hang of it.


For example, if you have never done a Sudoku puzzle before in your life, then starting with an advanced level Sudoku might be too much. Instead, start with a beginner or intermediate level puzzle and then work up to higher levels as you start to understand how the puzzles work.
Being successful with less challenging puzzles will also help to build up your confidence and motivate you to try more challenging ones.

 Use an old toothbrush to remove grease, lint, and dirt from all surfaces of your knife. Try applying a bit of dish soap to the toothbrush and then use it to scrub all of the surfaces of your knife.


For small, detailed areas, you can use a wooden toothpick or a cotton tipped swab (Q-Tip).
Rinse away the soap after you are finished and then dry the knife with a clean cloth.
 A magic eraser cleaning sponge may help to remove rust from your knife blade. You do not need to use any chemicals with a magic eraser. Just get it wet with a bit of water and it is ready to use.Use the magic eraser to scrub the rust spots off of your knife blade. Then, rinse off the blade and dry it with a clean cloth.
 You can also try to scrub the rust stains from the blade using a piece of fine steel wool, fine-grit sandpaper, or a wire brush.You can scrub the blade while it is dry, or add a bit of water, or use some water and dish soap.


If you do not have a steel brush or sandpaper, try using a crumpled ball of aluminum foil to scrub the blade.
Make sure that you rinse the blade after you are finished and dry it off with a clean cloth.
 If you cannot remove the rust with oil or cleansers alone, try using an electric rotary tool to remove the stains. Work slowly and carefully to avoid damaging the blade.Apply oil to the rusted blade before you use the rotary blade.
Use a fine brass wire brush attachment on your rotary tool to remove surface rust. Secure the knife in a vice grip, and apply the wire brush tool to the blade in short, smooth movements.
Change the brush attachment to a felt polishing wheel. Dip the wheel in polishing compound (such as 3-In-One, Clean Streak, or Metal Brite) and apply the wheel to the blade with smooth, short strokes.
Switch to a clean polishing blade and finish with a paste polish such as FlintzÂ . Buff the blade until it is smooth and shiny.

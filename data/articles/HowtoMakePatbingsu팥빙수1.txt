 For best results, use organic milk.
 Make sure that not too much milk has been poured; if this is the case, it will later be more difficult to remove the frozen milk from the cup., Wait for the milk to completely freeze. Leave it in the freezer for about 3-6 hours, depending on your freezer., Let the frozen milk thaw for about 30 minutes (this is the disadvantage of using this method; the patbingsu will be more liquidy), Open the plastic bag and pour the frozen contents into a blender. Blend until the consistency is of shaved ice (for 1-2 minutes, depending on your blender)., Put a spoonful of red beans (or red bean paste) on top of the shaved ice, and pour condensed milk. The condensed milk will give a sweet taste. Adjust the amounts of the toppings according to your preference. Additional toppings also include chopped fruit, nut powder, and tteok. Enjoy!

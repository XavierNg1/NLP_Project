 Multiple brands now offer quick mixes in individual packets that can be added to a bottle of water.
 Some water purifiers that can be attached directly to a home water faucet also offer flavor options. Only add the recommended amount (or less) to avoid overloading on sugar and other additive ingredients.
 Some pocket-sized flavor additives offer color and flavor to water without adding calories or other unhealthy ingredients.

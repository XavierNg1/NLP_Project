 Place the ground turkey in a large mixing bowl. Pour the spices over top. Use a spoon or your hands to mix the ground turkey and spices thoroughly. Knead the mixture for about 2 minutes to make sure the spices are evenly distributed.


Experiment with other spices if you like certain flavors. Add ground sage, oregano, and rosemary to mix things up.
You can also add 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese for extra flavor.
 Scoop about 1/3 cup of the mixture into the palm of your hand. Use both hands to shape it into a patty. Place it on a plate, then move on to the next patty. Continue until you've shaped all of the meat into patties.
 Place a pan or a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Pour the oil into the pan and let it heat up for a minute or two. Swirl it around the pan to coat the bottom, so the burgers won't stick.


You can also cook these burgers in the oven under the broiler. Turn on the broiler and let the oven heat completely before cooking.
Using the grill is another good alternative. Heat up a grill to medium high.
 Place the patties into the pan. Fit as many as you can in the pan without the sides touching. Cook the burgers on the first side for 3 minutes, or until a brown crust forms. Flip them over and cook them on the other side for another 3 minutes. Remove the burgers to a plate when they're finished cooking.


You can lay slices of cheese on the burgers after they've been flipped. To melt the cheese, cover the pan with a lid.
Season the burgers with additional spices to form a "blackened"-style crust.
Don't overcook the burgers or they'll get dry pretty quickly, since turkey has a low fat content.
 Place them on buns and serve with ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, sliced tomatoes and onions, and other condiments and toppings of your choice.

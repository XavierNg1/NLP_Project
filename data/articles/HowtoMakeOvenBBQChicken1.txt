 Melt the butter in a large, nonreactive saucepan over a low heat. Once it's melted, toss in the chopped onion and garlic and gently cook until tender. Sprinkle in the paprika, the crushed red pepper, the chili powder and the pepper. Cook for a minute to let the flavors develop.









Add in the remaining ingredients - water, brown sugar, vinegar, molasses, tomato paste and Worcestershire sauce.
You may need to whisk the sauce a little to achieve a smooth consistency.;
, Once all of the ingredients have been combined, allow the sauce to simmer, uncovered, for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Stir occasionally. Once the sauce has thickened slightly, do a taste test and add more seasoning, if necessary.
 Take out 1 1/2 cups of the sauce to use for preparing the chicken. Leave the rest to cool, then store it in the refrigerator until the chicken is ready to serve.

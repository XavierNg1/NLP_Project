 Add 1 tablespoon (13 g) of coconut oil and 2 tablespoons (42.5 g) of raw honey to a medium size bowl. Stir well with a spoon to ensure that the ingredients are fully combined.If you don’t have raw honey, you can substitute processed honey.
 In a separate small bowl, combine ¼ cup (59 g) of sea salt, ¼ cup (55 g) of sugar, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lemon juice. Stir the ingredients together until the mixture has a crumbly texture.It’s best to use organic sugar, but you can use whatever you have in your pantry.
 Once the salt and sugar mixture is combined, add it to the coconut oil and honey. Stir all of the ingredients together until a smooth, thick paste forms., When the scrub is completely mixed, use a spoon to carefully place it in a glass storage container or jar. Use the scrub 1 to 2 times a week to keep your hands soft and smooth.To use the scrub, massage a dime-sized amount over your hands for 30 to 60 seconds. Rinse with warm water and pat your hands dry with a towel. The coconut oil is highly moisturizing so you don’t have to apply a hand cream afterward.

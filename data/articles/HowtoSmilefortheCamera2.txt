 To achieve a consistent natural smile, it is important that you commit to having fun during the photo shoot. Jump around between shots to stay loose. Recall funny memories or jokes to make yourself laugh during the session. Fill your mind with happy thoughts that will ease your nerves. Donâ€™t take the photo-opt too seriously, but stay calm and enjoy your time in front of the camera., To relax your face, begin by taking a deep, cleansing inhale. On the exhale, smile. Simultaneously, relax your forehead, release your brow, and unclench your jaw. There will only be slight points of tension at the corners of your eyes and lips., Wrinkles are a byproduct of your natural grin. A natural smile causes lines to appear around your mouth. It also produces small lines around your outer eyes. When you fake a smile, these lines are less likely to appear, causing your grin to look forced., While flashing some of your teeth is acceptable, it can be unbecoming to reveal all of your teeth when you smile. Fortunately, there is a quick and simple trick to avoiding the joker grin. Raise your tongue and place it directly behind your top front teeth. This will lift your chin and relax your mouth.

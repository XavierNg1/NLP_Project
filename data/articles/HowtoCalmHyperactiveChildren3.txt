 Kids thrive on routine, and knowing what activities will be happening in the day can help give them a sense of stability. This doesnâ€™t mean you need to schedule every moment of the day, but you should have meals at regular times, homework time after school, bath time before bed, and so on.
 Sit down together with your child to eat meals. This gives the child a chance to eat good food while having your attention. Model healthy eating habits for your child.


Do not bring screen media to the table. Turn off the TV, computer and phone while eating meals together.
 Younger children need 10-12 hours of sleep every night, while teenagers need 8-9 hours of sleep.Make sure the child goes to bed at a reasonable hour and gets a full, uninterrupted night of sleep.


Limit use screen media (TV, computer, video games), especially before bedtime. This can disrupt sleep patterns.

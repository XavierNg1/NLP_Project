 Read up on the Imperium - the Inquisitor rulebooks, Witch Hunter/Deamon Hunter/Imperial Guard codexes for 40k are also good places for ideas.;
, Are they an Inquisitor? Cultist? Hired gun? Try to tie this into the game background. If you want a 'soldier' type character, say, be specific. Are they an Imperial Guardsman? Mercenary? PDF member?

, So a gunslinger would be an expert marksman and probably quite fast, while an Astropath is weak and slow, but a powerful psyker.
 If your character doesn't seem to fit any particular Archetype, good generic ones are Cultists, Desperados and Mutants.
 Give them a profile that doesn't differ to much from the one in the rulebook, or if it does in some way, justify to yourself why. A cultist with exceptionally high BS might have some training in Militias, for example. Decide on what special abilities and psychic powers (if any) the character needs to fit your vision of them.
 Almost all characters will at least have a close combat weapon or pistol. Fighter type characters will need a more powerful firearm such as a bolter or laser gun, or else close combat weapons like swords, chain weapons and so on. It's often good to give a character slightly quirky equipment such as a flamer or power claw, as it gives them more of a sense of individuality. Try to keep equipment appropriate- there is no way a Mutie rebel will have a plasma blaster! Armour or force fields are common, as are bionics.
 Write a couple of paragraphs on where they came from, how they became involved in the inquisition and what their aims are. Explain how they got their equipment and what it means to them.

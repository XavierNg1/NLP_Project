 Three software programs in particular can be used:


Immunet: This antivirus software specializes in protecting your PC from spyware and viruses. It is based in the cloud, allowing it to work quickly to find and remove potentially harmful programs.
AVG: Once you install this software, protection from spyware and PUPs is already turned on. It works by detecting programs that could be potential security threats. It may even halt programs that are harmless, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. This is especially so since trusted programs are being used to harness PUPs.
Avast: This is free software that can protect your PC from PUPs. It’s important to turn on all three protection shields that are offered: File System Shield, Web Shield and Mail Shield. Make sure to enable the PUP protection, since by default it is turned off.

 If you cannot afford to pay the entire bill, you may be able to arrange to make monthly payments. Most facilities will not charge interest rates on balances due if payments are arranged and made on time.Do not send partial payments without arranging an installment plan with the medical facility. Doing so may put your account in default status.
 Some hospitals may be willing to negotiate your bill, especially if you do not have insurance.Document your financial situation. Discuss why you want a reduction in your bill and then ask for the facilities to negotiate lower rates.
You may be able to support your argument for a lower rate if you can find out how much insurance companies are billed for the same services you received. This amount is often less than the amount uninsured patients are billed., You may be able to find a nonprofit to help you, or you can consider hiring a firm that will charge you a percentage of your savings to help you reduce your bill., If you still cannot afford to make payments, some charities will help patients pay for the emergency room.


Locate your financial information such as completed tax forms. Charities will need to verify your inability to pay.

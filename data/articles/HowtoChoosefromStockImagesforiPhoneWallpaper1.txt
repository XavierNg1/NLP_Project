 This is the grey gear icon on your iPhone's home screen.;
, You'll find it in the third group of options on this page.
 This is at the top of the screen.
 Apple has two to three stock photo albums listed here:



Dynamic - Contains simple photos with dynamic properties (e.g., they move). The photos here are similar to basic computer screensavers.

Stills - You'll find high-definition still photos here.

Live (iPhone 6 and up) - This album holds short, high-definition video clips that can be played by tapping and holding your screen.
 Keep in mind that using a photo from the Dynamic or Live folder will drain your battery life faster than using a Still photo will.
 Again, you'll see two to three options here at the bottom of the screen:



Still - This option keeps your photo completely still, regardless of changes in iPhone position. Available for all stock photos.

Perspective - Choosing this option will allow your photo to move slightly whenever you tilt your iPhone. Available for all stock photos.

Live - With this option enabled, you can tap and hold your screen to see your selected photo animate. Available for Dynamic and Live photos.
 This is at the bottom of your screen.
 You can apply your selected wallpaper to the following locations:


Lock screen (Set Lock Screen)
Home screen (Set Home Screen)
Both the Home screen and the Lock screen (Set Both)

, After selecting your preferred wallpaper location, your stock photo will be applied immediately.

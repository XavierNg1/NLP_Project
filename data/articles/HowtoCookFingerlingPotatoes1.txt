 First, wash your hands. Then use your thumbs and fingers to scrub the potatoes under running water. Only use water, never any sort of soap. Wash them even if you intend on peeling the skins, since your peeler may shift dirt and chemicals from the skin to the flesh when you peel unwashed potatoes., First, peel 1.5 lbs (680 g) of potatoes, if desired. Decide whether to serve them whole, halved, sliced, diced, or smashed. If you choose sliced, diced, or smashed, cut your fingerlings now with a clean knife. If you plan on serving them as halves, you can either halve them now or after boiling, when they are softer. Transfer to a pot when finished.For smashed potatoes, dice them up into small bits., Fill the pot with enough water to cover the potatoes. Place the pot on a burner. Set the burner to medium or high. Once the water starts to boil, lower the heat to simmer and let your fingerlings sit for ten minutes.If you enjoy potatoes with a vinegary taste, try substituting the water entirely with either white or malt vinegar. For a milder taste, use an equal mix of vinegar and water., After they have simmered for ten minutes, poke a potato with your knife. If the skin still offers resistance, let your fingerlings simmer for another minute and try again. Repeat until the knife slides smoothly through the skin and flesh without any difficulty., Turn off the burner. Hold a colander over the sink. Empty the pot into the colander slowly to avoid any splashback of scalding water. If you are going to serve them as halves but havenâ€™t cut them in two yet, do so now. Combine 2 tablespoons of melted butter with your seasonings in a bowl, add your potatoes, and toss.If you are smashing your potatoes, either toss them in the bowl with the butter and seasonings in the bowl first or simply use your masher to mix them in. If you need more moisture, add butter, cream cheese, sour cream, and/or cream in a tablespoon at a time until you reach your desired consistency.

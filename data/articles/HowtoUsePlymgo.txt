If you see where you want to go on the list simply click on the list and it will complete the location for you.

 this will generate a table which will allow you to compare the time, cost, carbon footprint and calories burned of walk, cycle, bus, taxi, drive. There will be a tab associated with each mode of transport between the table and the map. When you click on one of the tabs (e.g. "Cycle"), the route associated with the cycle journey will be plotted on the map, and at the top there will be further tabs: "Critical" allows you to plot information on the map which may affect your journey. If you see a brown roadworks symbol, click on it to see the routes affected and on blue annotation icons to reveal any notes on the routes. Keep an eye out for diversion routes as you may need to modify the journey based on the information given in the "Critical" tab.
 If you have chosen the bus tab the directions will also tell you the bus operator and service number.

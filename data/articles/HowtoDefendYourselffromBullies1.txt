 Your parents can often speak out on your behalf to the teachers and school administrators. Parents often exist within the same community, and your parents may be able to have a talk with the parents of the aggressor., Many kids, especially those who are not very popular, may have a few choice teachers they really like. If you have someone like this at the school, talk to this person about the bullying incidents.


If you are nervous about speaking to a teacher or school counselor on your own, ask a friend or parent to come with you for support.
Don't fear retaliation.Telling someone can result in the situation getting better. It cannot improve if you keep bullying a secret.
Don't view yourself as a tattletale. Bullies need to be stopped because they make one person's educational experience unsafe. By telling an adult, you are doing the right thing.
 Some schools have very serious protocols in place to act out against bullying. Speaking to adults first may get the situation under control before bullying goes too far.
 It may be necessary to take greater measures if bullying does not stop after parents and teachers are involved. You need to be persistent with updating them on the situation so they will know if further actions need to be taken.

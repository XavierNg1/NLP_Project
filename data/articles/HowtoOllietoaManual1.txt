Ollies aren't that hard to learn, but require a lot of practice. Once you have the Ollie down, everything else will be a breeze.;
,,

If you need to, bend down until your knees are tucked into your chest and tap the tail of the board onto the ground.
,

Do this by bringing your back foot up while you are still in the air.


Once you have the Ollie down, you're ready to go!

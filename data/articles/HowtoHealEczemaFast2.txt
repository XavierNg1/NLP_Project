 Eczema has been linked to junk food and a poor diet. Avoid foods that are inflammatory, such as fried foods, foods with artificial sugars, and foods high in preservatives. Instead, go for foods that are fresh and high in nutrients, such as vegetables, fruits, and healthy sources of protein like chicken, tofu, and beans.Talk to your doctor before you make any major changes to your diet. Do not change your diet drastically and suddenly without speaking to your doctor first.
Apples, oranges, kiwi, and tomatoes are common culprits of eczema.
 Eggs and dairy have been shown to cause skin issues for some people, especially if you have an allergy or sensitivity to these foods. Try cutting eggs and dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt out of your diet.If you notice your eczema improves once you remove eggs and dairy from your diet, you may have an allergy to these foods. You can get your doctor to do an allergy test to confirm your allergy so you can cut these foods out of your diet completely.
Peanuts, soy, wheat, and fish can also exacerbate symptoms.
 Eczema is also tied to stress and anxiety. Try to reduce your stress levels so your eczema does not flare up. Do a calming activity like reading, writing, or watching television. Go to a yoga class or take a long walk outside. Hang out with friends to help blow off some steam and keep your stress levels down.You can also try doing a five minute meditation to center your mind and stay calm. Do deep breathing to help you stay relaxed.
 Go for tops and bottoms made of cotton or other breathable materials like linen or hemp. Avoid clothing in synthetic materials or non-breathable materials like wool. Wearing breathable clothing will ensure your skin does not become more irritated by your clothing.You should also wear appropriate workout clothing when you exercise or sweat, as this can prevent your eczema from flaring up. Remember that exercise can make your eczema worse.

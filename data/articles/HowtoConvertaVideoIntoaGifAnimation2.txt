 There are hundreds of reputable, usable sites online for creating free GIFS. Use your favorite search engine to look one up -- there are plenty of viable options on the first page alone. While you can use any conversion site you like, some tested sites include:


Imgur
EzGif
MakeaGif.com

, You generally have two options -- you can either copy and paste the URL of the video from YouTube or Vimeo (Imgur), or drag and drop your video file from your computer (EzGif, MakeaGif).
 Find what part of the video you want to capture and pause it a few seconds before that position. Also, decide how big you want the GIF. In most web browsers, you can hold control and press plus and minus (+ -) to zoom in and out. If you're using a media player, you can re-size the window to change the size.
 12 FPS (frames per second) is a good frame rate to capture faster movements. However, if your GIF is too big, your computer may not be able to run everything smoothly at a higher frame rate. Most videos are shot at either 30 or 60 fps, but GIFs are meant to be quicker, smaller, and a little jerky looking.


The smaller the framerate, the faster the GIF will take to play and load. 10-15 FPS is usually perfect.
 All of these sites are different -- still, the button used to save or convert your video should be easy to find. You'll likely be asked to select where to save your finished GIF when it is converted.

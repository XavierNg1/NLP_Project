 Hold the food in place with the tines of your fork. Then, saw with the knife to slice the food item into a bite-sized piece. This part is essentially the same as the European method.
 According to traditional "etiquette," your tines should face down, with your palm wrapped around the end of the handle. Extend your index finger to the base of the fork.









Don't worry about which way the tines are turned. It may be easier to pick up food if you turn your tines upward, like a shovel. Most modern Americans do not pay much heed to which way the tines are facing., After you've cut the piece of food, place your knife on the edge of the plate. Switch your fork to your right hand. The end of the fork will rest in the area between your thumb and index finger. Use your right hand to bring the food to your mouth, and then switch the fork back over to your left hand so that you can cut another piece with the knife in your right hand. Repeat, switching hands each time you take a bite.









The American method may be more efficient if you cut your entire meal into pieces before you switch the fork to your right hand. This way, you won't have to keep switching the utensils back and forth.
 Many modern eaters and etiquette critics claim that the European style is less formal and more efficient than the American method. It is less disruptive to the eating process. Know that archaic social rules notwithstanding, there is truly no "right" or "wrong" way to hold a fork as long as you can eat your meal.

 The most basic absolute value equation will appear as y=|x|. Other numbers or variables may be involved though.
 To do this, make everything in the absolute value lines | | =0. If we use the example y=|x-2|+1, then we get the absolute value by making |x-2|=0. Then the absolute value becomes 2.


The absolute value is the number of points from |x| to ‘0’ on a number line. So the absolute value of |2| is 2, and the absolute value of |-2| is also two. This is because in both cases, ‘2’ and ‘-2’ are 2 steps away from zero on the number line.
You may have an absolute value equation where ‘x’ is alone. In that case, the absolute value is ‘0’. For example, y=|x|+3 changes to y=|0|+3, which equals to ‘3’.
 You want it to have two rows and three columns.


Put the first absolute value coordinate in the into the top center column for ‘X’.
Choose two other numbers an equal distance from your x-coordinate in each direction (positive and negative). If |x|=0, then move up and down an equal number of spaces from ‘0’.
You can choose any numbers, although ones that are near the x-coordinate are most helpful. They must also be whole numbers.
 You need to find the y-coordinate that pairs with the three x-coordinates you have. To do this, substitute the x-coordinate values into the inequality and solve for ‘y’. Fill these answers in on your table.
 You only need three points to graph an absolute value equation, but you can use more if you would like. An absolute value equation will always form a “V” shape on your graph. Add arrows to the ends to show that the line extends further than the edge of your graph.

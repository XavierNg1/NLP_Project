, You should not mount where you will be in another rider’s way. Mount outside the ring and then walk into the ring on your horse. You can also walk your horse into the middle of the ring (where there is usually less traffic) and mount. Some rings also have designated mounting blocks in a specific place.Have someone hold your horse to keep both you and the horse safe while mounting. This will also protect already-mounted riders and horses nearby.

Try to be fairly quick about adjusting your girth and stirrups., If you walk into the arena and most horses are travelling to the left, travel to the left with them. It is easiest for all parties involved if you mostly go with the flow of traffic. , If you are walking your horse in or out of the arena, be cognizant of people riding around you. Wait for a break in traffic before you cross the track to leave the arena.

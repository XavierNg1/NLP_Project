 It should ideally be at least 20cm / 8 inches wide and 1 cm thick and however long the dough is. You may do this in half batches.
 Cut the dough into triangle strips at least 10 cm, or 4 inches wide, making pizza like slices.
 Roll the slices from the wide end to the narrow and bend gently into a crescent.
 The rolls should be golden and hollow when tapped.

 Mix 10 drops of castor oil with two tablespoons of a carrier like olive oil, rubbing alcohol, sunflower oil, vodka, vinegar, or witch hazel. Pour the solution into a spray bottle and use it to coat your arms, legs, and other exposed areas in order to repel insects.When creating a homemade insect repellent with castor oil, the final product should contain no more than 5-10% castor oil. The rest of the solution should be rubbing alcohol or a carrier oil.
You could also use water as a carrier. Just mix 1.5 tablespoons of water with one teaspoon of castor oil, 10 drops of lemongrass essential oil, 10 drops of thyme essential oil, and five drops of geranium essential oil. Pour the mixture in a small spray bottle and shake before using.;
, Castor oil itself can function as a carrier oil. Combine one fluid ounce (two tablespoons) of castor oil with 10 to 12 drops of an essential oil of your choice. Pour the mixture into a spray bottle, shake it just before use, then spray it on the exposed areas you wish to protect from insects. The essential oil you choose to utilize will impact how useful the insect repellent is. For instance, you might use:lavender essential oil, which repels ticks
neem essential oil, which repels mosquitoes
lemongrass essential oil, which repels ticks and fleas
citronella essential oil, which repels biting flies and mosquitoes

, Many artisanal insect repellents contain castor oil. Use castor oil as an insect repellent by obtaining such a product at your local natural food store or online.Specific directions for use vary. Generally, however, you will simply spray or dab the premade product on the exposed area of your skin in order to dissuade insects from bothering you.
Always read manufacturer directions before using a bottled or prepackaged insect repellent.

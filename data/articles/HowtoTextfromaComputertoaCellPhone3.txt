 For iPhone users, iMessage comes already installed. For Android users, Hangouts (previously known as Talk) comes already installed. These programs allow for messages to be sent to clients on multiple platforms.


There are also other programs that offer similar functionality, such as Skype.
 To use Hangout on a PC, visit the Hangout website and download the extensions. To use iMessage from your computer, you must be running a Mac with OS X 10.8 or later. You will find the Messages icon in your Dock.


You will need to sign in with your respective account (Google, Apple ID, or Microsoft account).
 Select the contact from the list or type in a name to search. You can enter your own name to send a message to yourself.

The ice cube tray must be completely dry before doing this.
 Leave there for 10 minutes or so, allowing the spread chocolate to set firmly., Fill each hole with the chopped marshmallows and chopped dried fruit and/or nuts., Allow to cool slightly, then pour over the holes, coating everything and filling up all gaps., Tap the ice cube tray several times to cause the air bubbles to rise to the surface. You'll see them appear. This keeps them on the surface rather than within the chocolate, ensuring that you get solid chocolate., Or, you can leave it in a cool area., Peel back the silicone ice cube tray with care, revealing the mega chocolate bar beneath. You can choose to cut it to a smaller length or leave it as it is, depending on your preferences.

The chocolate bar will probably need tidying around the edges to remove stray chocolate pieces. Too bad, you'll have to eat those bits, to dispose of the messy evidence.
 The mega chocolate bar is now ready for serving or wrapping as a gift. Store in a cool, dark place. If you have used real fruit or real cream inside it, it must be kept in the refrigerator.

 It is much easier to hit a fly that is not moving. Be stealthy! The fly is probably scoping you out as much as you're scoping it out.


If it's in a position you don't like, wreak havoc around it. It'll be forced to go into a different, hopefully, more open area. If you know it's somewhere but don't know where, turn off the TV and anything else that's making noise. This will enable you to hear the fly and track it more easily once it takes to the air.;
, Get close enough to be able to swing and hit the fly, but not so close that it startles the fly into flying around again.


This takes some skill. You are up against an evasion artist. Before the fly takes off, it is executing a complex pre-flight routine: precise leg-to-eye positioning is taking place moment-by-moment. The extraordinary eyes (viewing field nearly 360Â°) pinpoint your location and the fly's nervous system translates this perception into precise leg positioning. These optimize instant take-off in the most likely evasive direction.And this is why it often seems that the fly is blessed with precognitive powers.
 You'll need to be able to swing fast and accurately. If flies are a constant problem, start practicing your aim and stealth (and clean up and shut your windows and doors).


The fly is planning to fly away at the last second. What you have to do is to predict where it is going to fly and aim there. You're going to beat him at his own game. Try to get him into a corner to limit his possibly flyaway zone.
 Be sure to clean up the remains of the fly after swatting it. Or you could leave it, completely creep out your family, and leave a stain on the wall.


You may want to use Windex, Pledge, or some sort of cleaner. This goes double if your victim was one of those huge, bulbous, super-buzzy flies.

 Use this process for metal or wooden furniture. Let it dry completely before continuing.


Sand wooden furniture gently. Unlike using a whitewash stain, you're trying to (largely) obscure the wood grain and make the furniture completely white. Over-sanding pine or oak can cause tannins to leak through the paint and tinge it yellow.Stripping off old finish is not necessary unless the finish is flaking off. If you need to, thoroughly sand the old finish until it is removed or follow the instructions under Whitewashing Old Furniture for safe use of chemical strippers.
 Let this coat dry as well before continuing.


Use a gripping primer on surfaces that are at all glossy or shiny.Use a stain blocking primer for surfaces that have already had a stain applied.Try to use water-based primers if your paint is water-based, and oil-based primers for oil-based paints. Mixing the two types will often work, but not always., Sanding between each coat of primer, or at least before the final layer, removes excess primer that has dried in uneven ridges., Each layer of primer should be very thin, so use at least two before painting. Always let each primer dry before applying the next.


The primer does not need to hide the color underneath.That's what the paint will do.
 Use a clean brush to apply the paint, and allow each coat to dry before applying the next. Using at least two thin coats of paint will create a smooth and durable result.Paint with a roller or use long, even brush strokes to apply an even coat of paint to a large flat surface.
For detailed or curving metal work, use a small craft brush from an art supply store.
 24 hours after the last coat of paint was applied, you may coat the furniture with any type of sealant to protect the paint job.


If you don't seal your furniture, avoid touching it as much as possible for a few weeks until the paint fully cures.

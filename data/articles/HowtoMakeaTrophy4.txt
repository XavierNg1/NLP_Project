 You'll need spray paint, craft decorations, spray adhesive (optional), glue, scissors, markers, and paper.
 If you have an old trophy, lying around somewhere in storage, see if you can dig it up. An old trophy that isn't doing anything but taking up space can be given new life and a new purpose with a little paint and crafting.


Make sure no one in the family wants the old trophy first before repurposing it.
 You can use acrylic paint on plastic trophies, but spray paint will be quicker and last longer. Get some newspaper on the ground or table so you don't get paint everywhere. Lay the trophy down on its side. Spray it with spray paint, making sure to get all the sides. Then flip it onto the opposite side and spray it again. Let the paint dry before touching it., Use whatever craft objects and tools you'd like to decorate the trophy. Glue some stars on it or use a spray adhesive and some glitter. The possibilities are endless.
 Use a label maker if you have one to make a label for your trophy. You can place the label right over where the old one was before it was painted over. Or you can cut out a small rectangle of paper that will fit over the old label. Write the label on the rectangle with paper, and then glue it on.

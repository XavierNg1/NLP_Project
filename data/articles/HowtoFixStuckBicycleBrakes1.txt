 Pads that are worn down significantly will stick no matter how much you adjust them. If your brake pads are less than 1/4-inch wide, then you need to replace them. They should be "toed-in," meaning that front edge of the pads should touch the wheel rim when you press the brake lightly., Some brake pads have a "lip" that sticks out on the side closest to the hub. If you've worn your pads down around the lip, then it might be stuck in the rim.








Shave down the lip. If you do find that the lip is sticking out too far, shave it down with a razor so that the wheel can spin smoothly. Be very careful not to slice off so much that the brake pads won't work!

, These are the points upon which the individual parts of your breaks pivot. If your levers feel rigid, try oiling the "pivot" pins on the lever handle. Place a dab of oil on each pivot point. Use a light machine oil or a special bicycle lubricant for best results.After you oil the lever pivots, they should feel snappy and quick when you pull them.









Do not use lubricant on brake pads, rotors, or rims. This might ruin the pads and make it hard for you to stop your bike!

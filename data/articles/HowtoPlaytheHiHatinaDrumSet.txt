 Do this by either holding down the pedal with your left foot or locking the top cymbal down using the wing nut.
 In many basic rock grooves, the hi-hats are usually struck on every quarter, eighth or sixteenth note. If you already have a feel for "closed" hi-hat use, learn how to start using the hi-hat pedal.
;
, If your foot is on the pedal holding the cymbals together, lift it up so the cymbals are not touching each other.



One exercise is the "heal-toe" - starting with an open hi-hat and your toe pointed up, bring your toe down to close the hi-hat. Simultaneously, point your heel up. Then, switch again. After practicing this rhythmically for a minute or two, the muscles in your lower leg will start to burn. You will soon be able to do this for longer and longer, becoming more efficient in using the hi-hat pedal for long time periods.
 This is to further the two cymbals from each other that they make more of a "sizzling" sound when struck. Playing traditional rock grooves with a looser hi-hat gives more of a metal feel.
 As timekeeping is a primary function of the hi-hats, you should practice "clicking" or "snapping" the hats together on beat. This is usually done on each of the quarter notes (1-2-3-4) or every other eighth note (the "ands" - 1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&.)

, Since you're using the pedal, play the normal hi-hat part on the ride cymbal, floor tom, cowbell, or another part of the drum kit.
 Hold the cymbals tight with the pedal, open the hats, quickly (almost simultaneously) strike the top cymbal, and immediately close the hats with the pedal again. This technique is often applied in hip hop, blues, and motown-like genres.

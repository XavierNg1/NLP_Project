 Because your limb will be kept inside your prosthesis during the day, your skin is at risk for becoming irritated or infected due to moisture. You will need to take extra care to properly and completely clean your limb everyday in order to prevent a skin condition from developing. Make sure your limb is kept as clean and dry as possible both before and after using your prosthesis.A small rash or irritation could turn into an ulcer or cut, preventing you from using your prosthesis until it heals.
Check your limb daily for blisters, sores or other signs of irritation. You may need to use a mirror or get someone to help you to do a thorough check.
Before bed, clean the limb with mild soap and water, pat dry, and put a small amount of lotion on the limb and massage it gently into the skin.Keeping your limb clean and dry will help you get the most out of your prosthesis.
 Because of hot water or the position you place your limb during a bath or shower, some swelling may occur. This swelling can affect the fit of your prosthesis when you go to wear it. For this reason, it's a good idea to bathe in the evening, when you are ready to take your prosthesis off for the night.Bathing in the morning may make your prosthesis difficult to put on properly.
Bathing may affect new amputees the most, causing their limb to swell and changing the fit of their prosthesis.
 It is very important that you keep a close eye on the health of your limb. If you notice any signs that your limb is being affected by your prosthesis, contact your prosthetist or physician as soon as possible.

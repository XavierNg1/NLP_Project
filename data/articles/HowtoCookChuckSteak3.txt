 Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F (204 C). Season your steak with any kind of seasoning you like. If you want to keep it simple, just use coarse salt and pepper. Don't be afraid to coat both sides of your steak with the seasoning since this will give it flavor and help it brown. You should be able to see seasoning on the steak. You could also use:Cajun seasoning
Chimichurri
Teriyaki
Montreal steak seasoning

, Place a heavy bottomed skillet (preferably a cast iron skillet) over high heat. Add a few tablespoons of coconut oil, grapeseed oil, or vegetable oil in the pan to heat. You want the pan to get really hot so the steak sizzles immediately and begins to brown.


Coconut, grapeseed, and vegetable oils all have high-smoke points so they won't burn as your pan heats up. Avoid pan-frying a steak in butter or olive oil which will burn.
 Place the steak in your hot oiled skillet and let it cook for 1 to 3 minutes. Carefully turn the steak and sear the other side for another 1 to 3 minutes. The steak should be a dark golden brown color on the sides. It will still be mostly raw inside, but you'll finish the steak in the oven for even cooking.


You can turn the steaks frequently while they're searing so they sear evenly and brown faster., Place the entire skillet with the seared steak into the preheated oven. Cook the steak for 6 to 8 minutes or until the steak reaches the level of doneness you'd like. If you check the temperature, the steak should be between 145 degrees F (62 C) for medium-rare and 175 F (79 C) for well-done. Transfer the steak to a plate and let it rest a few minutes before you serve it.Letting the steak rest helps the juices in the meat distribute evenly.
Ensure your skillet is ovenproof before placing it the oven. Even if it says it's ovenproof, check to see if it can be used in a 400 degree F oven.

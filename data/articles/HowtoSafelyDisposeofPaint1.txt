 Latex paint can be stored, mixed and reused for a later project. It won't be the exact color you need, but it's useful to use as a base paint or to paint interior surfaces that won't be seen. This way, you can use up all the paint without needing to throw it away.Tightly seal the used paint can and store it upside-down in a cool, dry storage area.
Make sure the stored paint is out of reach of children and pets.;
, If you don't have use for your leftover paint, someone else might. Look up community paint recycling programs in your area.


Waste haulers, schools, and municipalities often have programs to collect paint, mix it, and use it on community projects.
 If you don't have use for the paint and can't find a paint recycling program, dispose of the paint by placing it in a plastic container filled with kitty litter or paper scraps, letting it dry, and throwing it away with the trash. Latex paint is not considered toxic waste, so it doesn't have to be taken to a toxic waste site.


Never pour paint into a drain. It can damage your pipes and it isn't good for the water supply.
Don't pour paint into the ground. This is hazardous to the soil.
If you need to get rid of a lot of latex paint you may want to consider purchasing waste paint hardener. A cup or so of this powder mixed in with a gallon of paint will cause it to harden up within hours.
 Let the empty paint cans dry completely, then recycle them with other metals.


If you have an inch or more of dried paint left in the bottom of the can, you'll have to throw the whole can in the trash.

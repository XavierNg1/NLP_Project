 Use cool colors on your stand, such as a pastel blue or yellow tablecloth, a small lemon tree in a pastel pot, etc. then you will be on the way to creating a cool image. In addition, wear cool colors yourself, such as pastels (lemon yellow if you can). If you can manage to put across a look that suggests "cooling down here", the customers will be attracted to your stand.;
, Use fresh lemons. Have a basket of them sitting on the table for customers to see. You can even price each lemon at 50c and make a little extra. This fresh touch will be an attention winner.
 Arrows, large letters, groovy print (try bubble letters with polka dots), captivating colors. Stick these up where they will be seen! Charge at least one dollar or more for each up.
 Have space for cars to pull up and make sure there is plenty of room for pedestrians to mill about.
 Provide a small sign that says "Water for Dogs". This will attract those out walking their dogs and makes for a nice touch.
 Make sure the tip jar has a very wide mouth and a lovely saying to entice customers to add more money to it. Leave some coins in the base to encourage adding more.
 Play sweet sounding music in the background.
 Add granola bars, chocolate bars, etc. to your stock. If you're making your own, be sure to add the ingredients to avoid allergy issues. It's easier and more likely to meet with food regulations to buy commercial bars at a wholesalers and mark them up a little for profit.
 Instead, stop immediately, smile, and engage the customer. Ask them how their day is, how they're coping with the heat, and let them know how good your lemonade is. And suggest a chocolate bar to go with it.
 Be sure to have ice on hand. Fill a cooler and keep already poured lemonade in it.

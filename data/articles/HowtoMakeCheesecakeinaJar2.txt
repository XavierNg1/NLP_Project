 Place the cream cheese into a large mixing bowl. Add the sugar and lemon juice. Beat everything together until combined.Don't like lemon juice? Use Â¼ teaspoon of vanilla extract instead., Pour the heavy whipping cream into a chilled bowl.Beat it on medium speed until it turns light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. You can use a hand-held beater, an electric mixer, or a food processor fitted with whisks.
 Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often so that everything gets evenly mixed together.
 When you done, gently tap the jars against the counter.

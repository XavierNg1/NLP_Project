PetSmart offers four National Adoption Weekend events in Canada and the United States. These events occur in February, May, September, and November., Foster to adopt programs allow you to take a dog home with you and foster it, with the option of adopting the dog if nobody else has expressed an interest in doing so before you. Foster to adopt programs will give you the most long-term opportunity to interact with a dog before adopting it. There is no guarantee that you will be allowed to adopt the dog you fostered.
Most foster periods are at least one month.

 Create a deeper texture in the hair by lowering the handle end of the scissors. The farther you lower the scissors from their vertical position, the more hair you’ll cut. Do not not lower the scissors past a 45 degree angle, or you are not really performing a point cut anymore.Holding the scissors at 45 degrees will give you a choppy, layered look.
 Point cutting should usually not take off more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of hair. However, if you want to create an exaggerated effect, cut deeper into the hair when you have it pinched between your fingers. Cut between one and two inches (2.5 cm to 5 cm), but don’t cut more than two inches with this technique.


Always make sure the person whose hair you are cutting is aware that you are going to be taking off more hair.
 With the hair hanging straight down, gather a two inch section between and below your fingers. Rather than sticking up, as in the technique for short hair, the hair hangs toward the floor. Point the scissors upward toward the hair and perform the point cut as before.Cutting the lowest layer of hair in this way keeps the bottom layer from looking like a straight line.

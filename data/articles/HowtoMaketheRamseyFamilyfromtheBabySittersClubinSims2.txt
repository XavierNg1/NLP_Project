 All members here must have dark skin and hair.;
, His aspiration must be Family. Give him a beard and mustache. Dress him conservatively. He must be nice and outgoing.
 Her aspiration should also be Family. Her clothing should be in soft colors. If you use makeup to create her, make it conservative. She must be nice.
 Make the aspiration Knowledge. Make her neat, but somewhat grouchy. Give her glasses, short hair, and business casual clothing.
 (Even though Jessi in the books is eleven years old, we are going to make her a teenager in order to control her aspiration and do Turn-Ons.) Her aspiration should be Popularity or Romance. She should be nice, outgoing and somewhat active. Put her hair in a style that, if she were real, would not fall over her face. Dress her in casual clothes and make her sleepwear pajamas as opposed to a nightgown (keep in mind her age in the books). Give her light makeup. Her turn-ons should be black hair and fitness.
 Make sure she is playful and nice, but shy. Hair in this case is up for grabs, as long as it is by no means tomboyish. Give her a very girly everyday outfit, but at all costs avoid the pink fairy outfit - this would be too pretentious for Becca. (Note: This Sim as well as the one mentioned in step 5 must be sent to school and faithfully do their homework.)

, At all costs do not use the pink pajamas here! The best outfit for him would be anything with overalls.
, This will give them more money.
 Furnish it. Put toys for both Becca and Squirt in the house.
,, She will stay home to take care of Squirt.
 This was ruled out in book 55 of the series. If you must, use a hot tub.

 Look on the internet, in the newspaper, etc.;
, This will help you understand the plot and characters better, which will benefit your portrayal for the dreaded cold reading.
 Maybe something funny or a song that you think not many people would sing. But make sure it's a song that shows off your voice. Don't be afraid to be dramatic- when you express yourself and the character you are in the song, it helps the director see your acting skills!

, Try to sing it as much as you can. To overcome nervousness, sing it in front of your parents, siblings, or even your pet!Just make sure that by the time of the audition, you have as much experience in singing the song as possible.
 Read through the cold read script quickly and try to imagine how that character would really feel. Portray that into your acting.
 Don't be upset if you don't get a huge part. Remember: There are no small parts, only small actors. So don't be a small actor and ROCK it! The more experience you get, the better chance you have at later auditions. Good luck!

 Log into your Facebook account and go to your Timeline (until recently, this was called your Wall) by clicking on your name in the upper right corner.
 Click on “Photos” in the header. You’ll see it below your cover photo and between the “About” and “Friends” links. All the photos that are allowed on your Timeline will appear.
 After clicking on “Photos,” click on “Albums.” A list of your photo albums will appear.
 Choose either Timeline or Profile Photos, whichever contains the picture you want to make private. Then choose the picture itself.
 Click the audience selector, which is on the right side of the image, below your profile name and after the date on which the picture was uploaded.


Choose “Only Me” if you want to hide the album completely.
Choose “Friends” if you want only your friends and acquaintances to see the album.
Choose “Friends except Acquaintances” if you want to let friends see the album but hide it from designated acquaintances.
Choose “Custom” if you want to designate specific people who can view the album.
 You can also choose to click “Edit” on the right side of a particular image. Then click the audience selector and your preferred audience.
 Repeat this process to hide as many specific photos as you want.

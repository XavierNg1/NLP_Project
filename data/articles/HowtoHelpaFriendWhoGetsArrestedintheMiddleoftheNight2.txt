 Your friend should not say anything to you that he or she does not want others to know. Your friend should only offer the factual information such as where he or she is being booked and under what charge.
 If your friend is too flustered to offer the information, make sure you ask the charge for the arrest.
 The police should have read your friend his or her Miranda rights, which include the rights to remain silent and have an attorney present during questioning.The Miranda rights portion stating that “Anything you say can and will be used against you,” means that your friend should have legal counsel present before answering questions due to the possible consequences.


After reading your friend his or her Miranda rights, the police can continue to interact with your friend. Any voluntary statements your friend makes to them can be used at the trial.
The police cannot threaten your friend or force your friend in any other way to talk to them or give them any sort of statement.
 The Fourth Amendment states that law enforcement cannot search people’s property without probable cause and a warrant. Tell your friend to talk to the lawyer for any suspicion of an illegal search.


In the United States, moving vehicles are subject by law enforcement to search with probable cause after a traffic stop. This would not constitute an illegal search.

Visit a home hardware store with a tile department. Select coaster-sized ceramic tiles (about 4 inches by 4 inches (10.16 cm by 10.16 cm) featuring rough surfaces, such as travertine. A rough surface accepts an image much better than smooth-coated tiles.
Purchase enough tiles to make 1 set of 4 coasters for each recipient.;

Select a decorative paper stock at your art supply store. Look for paper that matches your party theme.
Purchase a clear craft glue. The glue should be viscous enough to brush onto a surface.
Shop for pre-cut felt squares. This fabric will cover the back surface of each tile coaster to prevent furniture scratches. Purchase enough felt to adhere onto the backs of each tile square.
Buy a bottle of clear spray-paint to act as a protective finish for the top of each tile.
 Using either soap and water or a paper towel soaked in alcohol, remove all dust and fingerprints from each tile. This ensures the image will adhere to the surface. Allow each tile to dry completely before proceeding.

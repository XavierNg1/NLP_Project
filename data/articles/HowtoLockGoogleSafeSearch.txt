, Enter “www.google.com/preferences” on the address bar. You will be brought to the Search Settings page.
 Look for the “SafeSearch filters” section, and tick the checkbox for “Filter explicit results” to enable SafeSearch.
 Right beside the checkbox option is a “Lock SafeSearch” link. Click on it, and you will be asked to sign into your Google account. If you’re already in, you will be asked to re-enter your password. This is to ensure that only admins can turn SafeSearch off.
 You will be brought to another page to confirm locking SafeSearch. Click the “Lock SafeSearch” button, and Google will lock SafeSearch across all of its domains for your account.


Once you confirm, only you can unlock SafeSearch.
 Go to Google’s search page, and on the results page, you will notice a picture of colored balloons on the top right corner. Whenever you see this, you will know that SafeSearch is locked.

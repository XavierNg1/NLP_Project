 Lay out four slices of sandwich bread. Spread butter or margarine to lightly cover both sides of each slice. Then cover two of them with sliced or shredded sharp cheddar cheese each, using 1 ounce (28.33 g) for each one. Cover each one with one of the other slices., Place a large dry skillet on one of your stovetopâ€™s burners. Turn the heat to medium-low. Once it heats up, place your sandwiches inside. Grill each side for approximately three minutes, until the cheese melts and the breads toasts to a golden brown., Transfer the sandwiches to a cutting board. Let them sit for a minute or two, until they are cool enough to touch. Trim away the crusts, then slice each sandwich into eight croutons of roughly even size. Divide your sixteen croutons into four servings and top each bowl of soup with four of them.

 Moisten several large towels and wrap them completely around the warped wood.









You can use towels, sheets, or rags. The material you use must retain moisture and be large enough to wrap around the warped wood piece.
Run the towels under water until they are soaked, then wring out as much excess moisture as possible. The material should be moist when you wrap it around the wood, but it should not be drenched.
 Set the wrapped wood out in a warm area that receives a lot of sunlight during the day. The concave (inwardly bent) side should face down and the convex (outwardly bent) side should face up.








You may want to place a plastic tarp beneath the wood to prevent the water from soaking the surrounding area.
This method works best during warm, dry weather. It may not work in cold, cloudy, or wet conditions.
For best results, place the wood on top of a rigid surface, like a driveway or deck. You can place it on top of your lawn, but the process may not be as effective if the wood sits on a soft surface.
 Depending on the extent of the warping, you will need to keep the wood in sunlight for two to four days. Spray the towels with additional water throughout this period to keep the wood moist.









As before, the material should only be moist and not dripping wet.
The sunlight should heat the covered wood and encourage it to absorb moisture from the towels. As moisture is absorbed into the surface, the wood should begin to warp back into its proper position.
 The entire process can take several days depending on the damage. Check it regularly. Once the wood is unwarped, remove the wrappings and let it dry.









When the sun disappears at night, you should bring the wood inside. Keep it in a warm place overnight with the inward curve facing down.
If you do not notice any progress after a few days, you may need to try a different method.

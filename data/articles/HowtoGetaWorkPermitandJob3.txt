 Many temporary jobs do not require a work permit. You can check whether you need one by visiting http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/work/apply-who-nopermit.asp#dropdowns and checking the job you intend to perform in Canada.


For example, you do not need a work permit to run or organize an international convention or meeting in Canada, unless you are doing hands-on work, such as decorating, setting up or taking down displays, or providing audiovisual services.If you intend to work as a public speak for more than five days, then you also need a work permit., Canada has a list of general eligibility requirements you must satisfy. Check to see that you do before applying for a work permit:Prove you intend to leave Canada when your permit expires
Show you have enough money to provide for yourself and your family during your stay in Canada
Obey the law and have no criminal record
Be in good health and take a medical exam if required
Work only for eligible employers
Avoid working for an employer that primarily offers erotic dance or massage, escort services, or striptease
Not be a danger to Canada’s security

, There are two types of work permits: open work permits and employer-specific permits. An open permit allows you to work for any employer, whereas an employer-specific permit is tied to one employer.By far, most work permits are employer-specific, and you must have an offer in hand from a Canadian employer before applying for one., Your requirements will differ depending on whether you apply for the work permit outside Canada, while inside Canada, or when entering Canada. See http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/work/apply-who-eligible.asp for detailed information.


If you apply when outside Canada, then determine which work permit you will need: an open work permit or employer-specific. You can apply for the permit when you apply for your visa.
Generally, you can only apply for the work permit while in Canada if you have a valid reason for being there. Examples include having graduated from a Canadian university, having a valid study or work permit, having temporary residence. You can apply online at http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/e-services/account.asp.
You can apply for a work permit when you enter Canada only if you are from a visa-exempt country and you have a valid medical certificate. You may ask for either an open work permit or finish an employer-specific application that your employer has completed.
 The amount of time you must wait will depend on your circumstances. You may receive a decision within hours or up to eight weeks later. The process can also be delayed if the government needs to confirm your offer of employment.Remember that you can’t work until you receive your work permit. However, if you obtained a business visa, then you can do any work allowable under the visa.

 Do this by walking outside of towns and looking for small triangular rocks aligned on the ground. You can walk up to them and grab the runes by hitting the A button next to the rune.


If you get the “Keen Eye: Rune Stones” perk in the Enchanting skill tree, runes glow so that you can spot them easier.;
, Enchanting Tables can be found in any Mages Guild or right in town. They are tables with a purple glowing crystal on top as well as an open book and scattered gems.
 When you find the table, walk up to it and hit the A button to go open its menu.
 Hit the A button over “Create” to get the Construction menu to come up, and you will see all of your runestones.


Runestones come in three types: potency, essence, and aspect. Potency says what it does—for example, adds, deducts, and increases. Essence runestones decide what the potency is going to effect, such as health, fire, magika, and so on. Aspect runestones determine the final quality.
 Try to pick something you need. You could make a superior Add Health rune for a piece of armor, for instance. When you pick the three types, look on the bottom right side of the screen to make sure they are correct.
 Hit the X button, and the ruins will be combined to make a glyph. Doing this action will give you the glyph and work towards leveling up your enchanting skill.

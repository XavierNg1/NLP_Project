 Some writers' groups, particularly statewide writing guilds, sponsor literature festivals that may include writers' workshops. Smaller groups that don't offer workshops can obtain information about workshops from other groups and disseminate this information to their members through their newsletters or email groups. In addition, the other members of your group can give you advice based on what writers' workshops they've attended in the past, including those you're considering.
 Libraries and bookstores often host writers' groups and sometimes put on literature-related events and consequently are aware of similar events located elsewhere. You can visit the library or bookstore in person, by telephone, or check its website.
 Universities and community colleges normally offer non-credit or continuing adult education classes on a semester, trimester, or quarterly basis and usually send out the next session's schedule prior to its start. You will find listings for any writer's workshops, which include a short description of the class, its schedule, and the instructor's name, whose credentials may also be included in the class description.
 In addition to visiting the websites of the sources listed above, you can also type "creative writing workshop" or "writer's workshop" into an Internet search engine, along with a literary genre or prospective location, and receive a list of upcoming workshops. Visit the sites of those workshops that interest you and use the criteria under "What to Look For" to decide on which workshop is best for you.


Some websites maintain their own lists of writing conferences, festivals, and workshops, such as that at http://www.newpages.com/writing-conferences/, which lets you narrow your selection geographically.

 To do a split, you will need to wear loose fitting clothes such as gym shorts, a leotard, or a gi, to avoid ripping your clothes in an unwanted place. It will also help you get into position faster.;
, If you can, try to practice on a slippery floor which will allow you to slide.
 Even if you feel that you won't need to stretch, you will definitely want to, to avoid tearing your muscles.


There are a lot of stretches that could increase your flexibility, such as butterfly stretches, lunges, standing forward bend, sitting forward bend, touching toes, pyramid stretches, lizard poses, and pigeon stretches. Try to hold each of those stretches for 25 to 40 seconds each.
 By now you are feeling pain, but remember it will be worth it in the end!


Distract yourself by watching T.V. while stretching, or just do anything you feel is going to distract you from the pain.
 As already suggested, it's a good idea to wear socks, to help you slide smoothly.
 When you feel discomfort it means that it is enough.


You also have to support yourself with your hands to avoid falling and injuring yourself.
 When you feel comfortable in that position, slide a little bit more. Repeat at 30 to 40 second intervals until you can't go down any further.
 You should see an improvement as you continue this, and stay persistent.

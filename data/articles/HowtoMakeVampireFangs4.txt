 Wet cotton balls can be trimmed to size, shaped, and stuck to your upper teeth in order to form quick fangs.
 Trim the cotton portion off the swabs and attach the remaining sticks to your teeth using nail glue.
 Form the clay into a pointed cone or "fang" shape and fit it to your tooth for a custom fit. Let the clay harden before using the fangs as part of a costume.
 If you have braces but still want to make vampire fangs, you can so so easily be forming braces wax into the shape of a fang and lodging it in between your canine teeth and the braces wire.



Combine the wax with clay for a more realistic look.
 As long as the plastic has not touched anything toxic, you can cut out a pair of fangs from the bottle and attach them to your teeth.

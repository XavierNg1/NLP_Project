 Lay all ingredients and tools on working surface. Wash your hands, and make sure to dry them. Preheat oven to 400 °F (204 °C).;
, In a large bowl, mix together 3 cups of graham cracker crumbs and 1 cup of warm milk. Mix until it forms a sticky consistency, and add more milk as necessary. Make sure crumbs are visible. Add 1/2 of flour into the mixture and stir. Be careful not to over-stir Keep mixing until the 1/2 cup flour blends in. Moderately add the rest of the flour until you have a dough-like mixture.
 Take out the muffin tray and coat each cup with a little vegetable oil. Take a spoonful of the prepared dough and coat each cup at the bottom and around the sides with dough. Be careful not to make crust too thick, nor too thin.
 Let crust bake at 400 degrees for 9 minutes, or until a little hardened. Check on crust every 3 minutes to make sure it isn't burnt.
 When tarts are hardened, take about 1 spoonful, depending on size of cup, and fill each cup to top with cream cheese. Bake at the same temperature for another 5 minutes, then get out of oven. With a spoon or knife, spread the cream cheese evenly over the top of the tart. Also, pour about 1 teaspoon of a little milk on top of each individual tart. Let bake for one more minute.
 Take tarts out of oven, and let cool for at least 5 minutes. Remove from cups after cooling, using a knife to separate crust from sides, and a spoon to scoop up tarts. Place tarts on a plate, cutting board, or tray. Garnish as wished.
 Tarts will keep in the refrigerator for 3-5 days. Cover plate, tray, or cutting board with plastic wrap while storing.

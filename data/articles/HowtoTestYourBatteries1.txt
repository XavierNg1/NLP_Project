 If you have have a device that harbors multiple batteries, it would be a good idea to test all of them. Keep in mind that this method only works for alkaline batteries, more specifically the AA and AAA models.
 Preferably have it held one or two inches above a flat surface, such as a table., If it bounces and falls over, then you can assume that it is dead. Dead alkaline batteries have a gas inside that account for this bouncing. If your battery doesn't bounce, or even stands up, then it still has its juice!

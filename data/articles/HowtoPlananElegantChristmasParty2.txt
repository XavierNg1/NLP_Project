 You should have dim lights. You can find clear Christmas lights at any home improvement store or supermarket (Like Kmart, Target, or Walmart.) Hang enough to be festive, but not too many. Make sure the guests can see! However, do not hang colorful lights as the colors may appear to clash with certain color schemes.;
, With general d√©cor, make sure you have certain tables for each event. Possible tables include a gift exchange table, a refreshment table, or a food buffet table. However, if you have a tree, you won't need a gift exchange table.
 Never hang too many bows or too many garland, as it might turn tacky.

 In the U.S., Medicare currently covers care in a skilled nursing home facility if it is medically necessary for you (and if you meet the other qualifications for Medicare). This means that if you require constant care, like for changing sterile dressings, you may qualify for nursing home coverage.However, if you just need help with bathing or dressing, this qualifies as custodial care needs, which is not covered by Medicare.
Check with any nursing home you are interested in to make sure they accept Medicare payments. Not all nursing homes accept this type of coverage.
Medicaid provides some nursing home coverage for low-income individuals. So check your eligibility for this type of coverage as well.
 Long-term care can be quite expensive, but some people choose to plan for these needs out of their own pockets. If you are able to financially, it might be more beneficial to set aside some money each year in an interest-yielding account earmarked for long-term nursing home care.Nursing home insurance is typically a good choice for middle-income families who wish to avoid burdening their family with end-of-life care costs. This includes those who have enough money that they don’t qualify for Medicaid coverage, but who can’t afford paying all of the costs out of pocket.
 If you can afford it, begin paying for nursing home insurance sooner rather than later. After 50 years old, nursing home insurance premiums can increase significantly. You are also more likely to get a preexisting condition as you get older, which can also impact your coverage price.Insurers can also deny coverage due to preexisting conditions. So the younger and healthier you are when you sign up, the better coverage and price you will get in the long run.

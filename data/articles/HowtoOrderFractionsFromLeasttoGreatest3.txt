 If a fraction has a top number, or numerator, that is larger than the bottom number, or denominator, it is larger than one. 8/3 is one example of this type of fraction. You can also use this for fractions with an equal numerator and denominator, such as 9/9. Both of these fractions are examples of improper fractions.You can still use the other methods for these fractions. This method helps these fractions make sense, however, and might be faster.
 Turn them into a mix of whole numbers and fractions. Sometimes, you might be able to do this in your head. For example, 9/9 = 1. Other times, use long division to find out how many times the numerator goes evenly into the denominator. The remainder in that long division problem, if any, gets "left over" as a fraction. For instance:


8/3 = 2 + 2/3
9/9 = 1
19/4 = 4 + 3/4
13/6 = 2 + 1/6

, Now that there are no improper fractions, you have a better idea of how large each number is. Ignore the fractions for now, and sort the fractions into groups by whole number:


1 is the smallest
2 + 2/3 and 2 + 1/6 (we don't yet know which is larger than the other)
4 + 3/4 is the largest

, If you have multiple mixed numbers with the same whole number, such as 2 + 2/3 and 2 + 1/6, compare the fraction part of the number to see which is larger. You can use any of the methods in the other sections to do this. Here's an example comparing 2 + 2/3 and 2 + 1/6, converting the fractions to the same denominator:


2/3 = (2x2)/(3x2) = 4/6
1/6 = 1/6
4/6 is greater than 1/6
2 + 4/6 is greater than 2 + 1/6
2 + 2/3 is greater than 2 + 1/6

, Once you've sorted the fractions in each group of mixed numbers, you can sort your entire list: 1, 2 + 1/6, 2 + 2/3, 4 + 3/4.
 Keep the order the same, but undo the changes you made and write the numbers as the original improper fractions: 9/9, 8/3, 13/6, 19/4.

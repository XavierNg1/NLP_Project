 Use a comfortable chair, and choose an area with enough room for adequate desk space, your equipment, and storage for your notes and books. Keep your equipment (such as a reading machine or computer) and storage shelves within arm’s reach. Make sure everything you use, from audio recorders to laptop plugs, has a designated home to reduce the time it takes to locate them., If you use paper storage for your notes, keep them organized by class and date. Label your filing folders using a tactile pen for easy reference. For your digital storage, create file and folder names that include a course title, date, and brief description of their contents., Make a study plan at the start of the week and stick to it. List that week’s assignments and break up work into nightly tasks. For example, if you know you have a test on Friday, designate an hour each evening to study each unit included in the test.Remember to pace yourself and take breaks so you don’t spread yourself too thin. It can be taxing to convert text documents and use technological interfaces, especially for long reading assignments.
 Come up with small incentives that will help you meet your time management goals. You could have a favorite snack or treat, give yourself time off from schoolwork, or schedule some time for your favorite activity. If you don’t meet your study goals you don’t get your reward, but try not to be too hard on yourself.

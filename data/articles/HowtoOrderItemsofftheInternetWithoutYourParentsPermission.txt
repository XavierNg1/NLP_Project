 Go to the website you wish to order off of and add the item to your wish list and check the shipping. Add the shipping and the actual cost of the item. The sum is how much money you'll need to buy the item.;
, Most stores will have a website and the website should accept gift cards as payment. Buy enough gift cards to get your item.
 Order the item and look for an appropriate shipping speed. Try to have the item arrive when you know your parents are not home or when you can check the mail.
 Check the mail before your parents do. Do not go overboard in worrying about the mail.
 Look for a place to hide it in your room or the basement. Make sure your parents won't find it ever because then you will be caught.
 Throw away all receipts, boxes, envelopes, etc. This can also get you in trouble.

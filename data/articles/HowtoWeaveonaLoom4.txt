 Flip the cardboard loom over to the back. Carefully peel off the masking tape. Retrieve your scissors and cut the warp threads down the center of the cardboard loom., Carefully remove each warp thread from the slits running across the top of the cardboard loom. Starting in the right corner, tie warp threads together in pairs close to the weaving. Repeat until all the warp threads are tied in pairs. Remove each warp thread from the bottom slits. Tie the warp threads together in pairs close to the weaving. Retrieve your scissors and trim the fringe in an even line. If you would like to create thicker fringe, use the tapestry needle to thread a length of wool between each section of warp thread. Tie thread’s tool tails together close to the weave. Continue to insert wool until you are happy with the thickness of the fringe., Beginning at the end of the weaving, thread one loose end onto a tapestry needle at a time. Take the strand around the side and weave it into the piece—go over and under several like color rows at a time. Snip the piece of wool close to the weaving. Repeat until all the loose ends are tucked into the material.

 Pupitar is a Ground-type Pokémon and is generally immune to attacks of electric types, receiving little to no damage at all.;
, Pupitar is weak against these types and will take severe damage if attacked by either a Water- or Grass-type Pokémon.
 Pupitar evolves to Tyranitar at level 55, so until then, you have to make Pupitar battle as much as possible.


You can’t use stones to make Pupitar evolve. There are no in-game stones, such as Fire and Water Stones, that you could use to force it to evolve.

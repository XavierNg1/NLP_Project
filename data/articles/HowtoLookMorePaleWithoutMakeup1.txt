 Lemon juice is one of the best-known and most effective lightening and bleaching ingredients. Many use lemon to lighten hair, but it also is effective in lightening the tone of your skin.To prepare the lemon juice, squeeze several small lemons into a small bowl. Prepare your skin by washing your face and any other parts of your body that you wish to be paler with a gentle face or body wash. Apply the lemon juice to your face or other parts of your body by brushing on the lemon juice with a large clean brush or by dabbing the mixture on with a paper towel.
Let the lemon juice sit on your skin for 20 minutes, then wash it off with cool water.
For an especially effective lightener, keep the lemon juice on overnight and then wash it off in the morning.;
, Tomato is also a natural lightening agent that has several other health benefits, among which is the reduction of oil production to prevent acne.To create a tomato mask, mash a tomato in a large bowl with a potato masher until it is a pulpy liquid, then squeeze the juice of one lemon into the tomato mixture and stir. Wash your face and/or body with a gentle face or body wash and pat them dry. Then use a pastry brush or paper towel to apply a layer of the tomato honey mixture on your skin.
Wait a few minutes until the layer is dry, then apply another layer of the pulp. Leave the mask on for 20 minutes, then wash it off with cool water.

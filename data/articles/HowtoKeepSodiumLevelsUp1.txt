 Some foods naturally contain more sodium than others. Including more of these foods can help maintain a higher sodium balance.


Try include one or more servings of these high sodium foods daily: fish and shellfish, swiss chard and spinach, artichokes, seaweed, red meat, and eggs.Also include foods that are high in salt and have other benefits.

 If you have any spare toilet paper rolls laying around, you can turn them into a fun, wiggly snake using a bit of paint and string. Here's a list of what you will need:


3 â€“ 4 toilet paper rolls
Acrylic or tempera paint
Paintbrushes
Scissors
Yarn
Red paper or ribbon
White school glue or tacky glue
Markers, crayons, or googly eyes
Hole punch

, If you cannot find that many toilet paper rolls, you can use some paper towel rolls instead.
 If you are using paper towel rolls, cut them into thirds.
 You can paint them all one color. You can also paint each roll a different color. If you want to add patterns and designs, wait for the paint to dry first.
 You don't want them to get mixed up with the body of the snake.
 There will be two holes on the top, and two holes on the bottom. The holes need to be straight across from each other. Make sure that the top and bottom holes on each side are aligned.
 The holes need to be straight across from each other.
, Don't tie the yarn too tight, or the snake won't be able to wiggle. There should be a gap between each piece. Try to hide the knot inside the snake.
 Cut a long, skinny rectangle from a piece of red paper and cut a V shape into on end. You can also use a piece of red ribbon. Glue the flat end inside the snake's head. Make sure that it is in the middle of the mouth.


If you want your snake to have a closed mouth, ask an adult to staple the end of the roll shut, right over the tongue.
 You can draw the eyes on using a crayon or marker. You can also paint them on. If you have any googly eyes at home, you can glue them on using white school glue or tacky glue.

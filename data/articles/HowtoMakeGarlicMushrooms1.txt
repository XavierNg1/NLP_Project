 Stir them occasionally. The lid will trap the moisture, and keep the mushrooms from burning., This will help evaporate any excess liquid, and keep the mushrooms from becoming too soggy. Remember to stir the mushrooms from time to time with a spatula, so that they don't burn.

 You can eat the mushrooms on their own, or add them as a side dish to steak, chicken, or any other thing you like.

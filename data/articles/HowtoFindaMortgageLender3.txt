 Make sure to be cautious when making such a major financial commitment. Lenders and brokers are people just like everyone else. Most are professional and will put your interests first. But some may be unscrupulous. The only way to know what is best for you is to explore all of your options.An unscrupulous lender might offer different rates to customers with the same credit score to earn an average fee for themselves. This is illegal. Also be mindful that, if the lender has offered to lower or eliminate a fee, they have not also added or increased another fee.As a rule, it’s best to avoid a lender who offers to negotiate.
 When you have a rate that you like, ask for a written lock-in. This will protect you from having your rate increased for a set period of time while your loan is processed.Be aware that you can’t lock in a rate until you have a contract – the lock-in actually attaches to the property itself.

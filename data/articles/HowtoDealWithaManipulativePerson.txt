 You can't do anything about the person, or the people who fall for their games, but you can protect yourself and others.;
, While you want to let them down relatively gently, continue to protect yourself by beginning to put some distance between you and the manipulator.
 If the manipulator notices your increased distance, try to talk to them about their manipulative qualities. Remain calm, cool, and collected throughout the conversation whether or not they do. Drama will only make things harder on you. If they like drama, let them wallow in it by themselves.
 This doesn't mean simply putting distance between the two of you, but stopping contact completely. While it will be difficult, in the end it will be healthier for you and the manipulator.
 People can and do often grow with time. Be ready for harmony if and when it comes.

 A lot of people think spiders are insects, but they're actually very different. To make sure the creature you've encountered is actually a spider, look for the following qualities:


Two body segments. Unlike insects, which have three body segments, spiders only have two.
Eight legs. Don't mistake an insect's antennae for legs.
No wings. No species of spider has wings. No matter how spider-like the creature may otherwise appear, if it has wings, it's not a spider.
 If you live in New York City, you probably won’t encounter the fearsome banana spider (although it's certainly not impossible). Familiarizing yourself with the species that live in your area is a good way to narrow down the possibilities when it comes to identifying spiders.


There are many excellent resources you can use to learn more about spiders. Check out a book from your library or look at spider databases online. You can search according to region., You can learn a lot from the place where you encountered the spider, as well as the web or burrow in which you found it. Answer the following questions regarding the spider’s habitat:


Where did you find the spider? Was it in the bathroom, the basement, the shed, outside, etc.? Was it in a dark place (as preferred by the baboon spider), or a place with plenty of light? Was it a wet place (or even in the water, like the water spider) or a dry one?
What type of web does the spider have? Is it a classic-looking spider web, a tunnel web (as made by the purse spider), or just a few strands of webbing that aren't neatly woven?

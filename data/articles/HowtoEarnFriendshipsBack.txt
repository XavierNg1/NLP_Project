 The first stage is to accept that you are in the wrong and to figure out what you did to upset or offend the person.;
, Understand that they may not want to be friends again straight away. Think about what you are going to say before you say it. An insincere or vague apology is often worse than no apology at all.
 A few days later, try again. Ask the person if you can be friends, or at least talk again, and ask them to give you a chance. It is going to take a long time to earn their trust and friendship back and if you are really determined, you have to work at it. If they still say no, give them space and don't pester them. Move on and find someone else to be friends with.
 This could help your friend realize you are sorry, or it could make them think you are trying to buy their friendship. You should only do this if you know your friend well and know they would react well to this.
 Don't upset them or offend them, be nice to them (but don't over-do it), try your best to be a good friend. Don't expect them to confide in you straight away, and realize that it will take time for it to get back to normal.

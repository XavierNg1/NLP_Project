 Just after the baby's born, see if a friend or family member can offer you extra assistance. Simply having an extra hand around the house can be a huge help when you've just had an infant. A family member, like a parent, may actually be eager to spend time bonding with your kids.Approach someone directly and ask with gratitude. For example, "I would really appreciate if you had any extra time to come over and help with the kids. I'm still adjusting to my new schedule."

, Professional services can be helpful, if they're within your budget. Consider hiring someone part time to help out the kids or do some basic housework.You can always hire a high or college school student to help with the housework. Someone in school may not charge as much as professional services.
 Churches and community centers may offer help for parents with young children. See if they offer classes or even free or discounted daycare.If you are currently a member of a spiritual community, take advantage of any services offered.
See if there are any free or cheap childcare classes. Going to classes with other moms and children can help you learn tips and tricks about how to manage your time.
 Sometimes, it can be hard to accept help, even when you need it. However, everyone needs extra help from time to time. You do not need to feel like a burden for accepting help when in need.The person offering to help may get something out of helping you. They may genuinely enjoy being helpful and being around kids. Accepting help is not necessarily taking advantage of someone.
Remember times others have needed help. You have probably offered to help them as well. You likely did not feel resentful of the other person, or judge them for needing help. They probably do not feel this way about you either.

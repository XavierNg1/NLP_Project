 Canned chickpeas are often packaged with water inside the can. Use a can opener to open the can and then drain any water from the peas. Use paper towel to pat the chickpeas dry.


Make sure your peas are well dried before frying them. Drier chickpeas will yield a better end result.;
, Put a large skillet over a burner on your stovetop and set it to medium-high. Coat the bottom of the skillet with the olive oil. Insert your chickpeas into the skillet and cook these until they are golden brown and crispy.


Stir the chickpeas occasionally while you are cooking them with a wooden spoon or a similar kitchen implement.
Although cook times may vary, you can generally expect your chickpeas to cook in about 17 minutes., Turn the heat off and remove the skillet from the burner. Use a kitchen implement, like a wooden spoon, to push the chickpeas out of the skillet and into a mixing bowl. Toss the chickpeas gently with the cheese, garlic powder, lemon rind, oregano, salt, and pepper.If you like your chickpeas to have more of a kick, you might add a little extra garlic powder and pepper.
 After seasoning, your chickpeas can be eaten immediately. If you plan on saving these peas for later, spread them out on parchment paper to cool, then put them in an airtight container. Keep these in the refrigerator for about 4 days.

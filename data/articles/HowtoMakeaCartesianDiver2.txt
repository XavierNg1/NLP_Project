 The Cartesian diver was invented by Renee Descartes to explain properties of gasses. But it only makes sense when you remember how density works. In short, objects only float in water if they are less dense than water. Air is much less dense, so your airy diver starts at the top.Density is basically how heavy something is per square inch. A box filled with feathers, for example, is much lighter than the same box filled with metal. Since they are the same sizes, but different weights, you'd say the metal box is much more "dense.", When you squeeze the bottle, none of the water escapes. But the area it is in gets smaller, so it pushes together against the air bubbles nearby, compressing them into smaller packets of air. But this is like squeezing a sleeping bag together -- it gets smaller, but it still weighs the same amount. The air, thus, gets denser., Squeeze the bottle enough and, eventually, the size of the air inside your diver gets so small that is it denser than the water surrounding it. This causes the diver to sink because it has too much density to keep floating.
 The obvious parallel is to scuba divers, who wear heavy metal belts to help them sink. But they also have "buoyancy compensators," small bags they can fill with low-density oxygen from the tank to help them surface again. Submarines have ballast tanks that are filled with water to help them dive. When they need to go up, air is pumped in to push the water out, bringing the sub back to the surface.

 Babies are born with reflexes that occur normally in response to certain touches. By understanding these reflexes, you will be able to calmly incorporate them into your massage routine.;
, When you touch the cheek, your baby will turn her head towards that touch. If you stroke the sole of the foot; your baby will curl her toes towards that touch. The same is true if you stroke the palm of her hand. Turn her head to the side and she will arch her whole body away. These are common reactions that almost all babies have when touched.

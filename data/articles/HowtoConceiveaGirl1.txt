 The Shettles Method is based on the fact that the Y chromosome (boy) sperm are smaller and less robust, but move faster than the larger X chromosome (girl) sperm.Therefore, having intercourse further away from ovulation will favor the slower moving X (girl) sperm.;
, One way to do this is to chart your cervical mucus daily. Just before ovulation, cervical mucus is watery and elastic, with the consistency of a raw egg white.


By charting your cervical mucus for one full month, you should be able to pinpoint exactly when you are ovulating.Shettles recommends sexual intercourse up to 3 days before ovulation in order to increase your odds of conceiving a girl.
 Shettles recommends taking your temperature before you get up each morning, and being extremely careful to lie as still as possible, as any activity can give you an inaccurate reading. The reason for the temperature charting is that at the time you begin to ovulate, your temperature will spike., These kits will detect when your body has released Luteinizing hormone (LH), which is a precursor to ovulation; which is most likely to start about 24 hours after you get a positive reading for LH.
 Shallow penetration is more likely to deposit the sperm closer to the entrance of the vagina, which is more acidic than the area near the cervix.The theory is that the acidity will weaken the Y (boy) sperm while allowing more X (girl) sperm available for egg fertilization.


The female body produces a substance after orgasm that make the vagina more alkaline, which favors the Y (boy) sperm.
The contractions produced during an orgasm will help propel the sperm up and into the cervix, which gives the Y (boy) sperm the advantage.

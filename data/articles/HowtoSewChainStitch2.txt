 This variation on the basic chain stitch has a thicker, more defined appearance, making it a great choice for stitching borders and outlines that you want to stand out. To begin, you'll want to create a one-link basic chain stitch according to the method above.In other words:Start with a single small stitch
Come back through the fabric at a spot in line with your stitch (less than an inch or so away)
Loop your thread through your first stitch
Put the needle back through the hole it came from.
 At this point, the heavy chain stitch starts to differ from the basic method. Come back through the fabric a little ways from your first link as you normally would, but then make a loop that passes through the original "anchor" stitch — not the link you just made.


After this, pull the thread through and put the needle back through the hole it came from once again.
 Come back through the fabric below the second link. Pass the needle under both of the previous links. This is crucial — you want the thread to pass under not just the second link, but the second and first links together. When done, put the needle back through the hole it came from as before.


Ignore the original "anchor" stitch — we don't need to deal with it any more.
 Continue this pattern to extend your chain. Each time you come up through the fabric, loop your thread under the last two links you've made. If you do this correctly, a thick, "tight"-looking chain stitch should begin to form.


It takes careful attention to get the pattern down, but once you get it, this stitch isn't difficult. Until it becomes natural, be careful about missing a stitch and looping your new link through just one previous link instead of two — if you don't catch your mistake, this will give your finished product an uneven "kink" in the chain.

 You can also use a can of spray-on glitter to add shine and sparkle to your wooden projects. Spray-on glitter cans can be found at craft stores and some major retailers.


Do not use spray-on glitter indoors, especially in an area that is not well ventilated. If possible, work outdoors.
 This will directly apply the glitter to the wood and use a sealant to attach it. You can sprinkle additional glitter onto the wood while the spray is drying, or leave it as is., Once the first layer of glitter has dried, you can spray on additional layers of glitter. You can add as many layers as you'd like, but let the adhesive dry in between applications. The more layers you apply, the thicker the application will be and your project will be more glittery.

 Powdered or ground saffron may be cheaper than saffron threads, but there’s a good reason for that. It doesn’t have the same flavor, aroma, and color as fresh saffron, so it doesn’t provide the same rich taste and appearance. In fact, powdered saffron often contains paprika, turmeric, and bark from inferior saffron threads., Saffron threads should have a deep red color with orange tips. If you notice that the threads don’t have orange near the ends, it can be a sign of inferior saffron that’s been dyed to have a richer color.Make sure that the color is uniform too -- lighter streaks throughout the threads can be a sign of poor quality.In general, the deeper the color that saffron has, the higher quality it is.
 High quality saffron threads are typically fine and uniform in size. One end usually has a trumpet-like shape, while other has a thin, tendril-like appearance. If you notice that the saffron is irregularly shaped, features shreds instead of strands, or contains bark, it’s probably inferior quality.If the threads have a frayed, almost worn appearance, that can also be an indication that the saffron is poor quality.

 To create the assertion, try putting the quote in your own words. Relate it back to your thesis statement or to an overarching theme or idea in the paper. Write a short assertion that is no longer than one line or eight to ten words long. This will frame the quote for the reader.For example, you may write an assertion like, “Arendt does not see totalitarianism as a positive result of war.”
Or you may write an assertion like, “Hamlet argues against Rosencrantz’s claim that he lacks ambition.”

, Once you have written the assertion, place it in front of the quote and then use a colon. After the colon, write down the quote.For example, you may write:

Arendt does not see totalitarianism as a positive result of war: “Totalitarianism is to be feared and loathed.”
Hamlet argues against Rosencrantz’s claim that he lacks ambition: "I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space.”



, This is a good option if you want to only quote a key part of the text, or several parts of different lines in the same passage. Integrating the quote will allow you to use it as evidence for your own thoughts.For example, you may write:

For Arendt, state sanctioned propaganda was essential totalitarian regimes, where “one could make people believe the most fantastic statements,” thereby confirming the state’s power over its citizens.
Hamlet is doubtful of Rosencrantz’s view, claiming he could be “bounded in a nutshell” and still feel powerful, “a king of infinite space.”

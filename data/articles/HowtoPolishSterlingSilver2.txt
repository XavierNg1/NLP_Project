 There are two primary types of silver polish available on the market: a liquid, spray on, or cream silver polish. The former is better for regular polishings and minor tarnish while the latter is best for heavy tarnish and larger silver products., If you are using a liquid polish, shake the bottle well before applying. Get some of the liquid or cream on a clean polishing cloth, and wipe it onto the surface of the silver. Allow it to set for 1-2 minutes depending on the amount of tarnish.
 Use another section of your polishing cloth to wipe the polish around on your silver, focusing on tarnished areas. This is your primary polish session, so get off any unwanted marks or spots at this point.
 Run your silver under lukewarm or cool water to wash off the polish. Use a clean sponge or cloth to remove all traces of the chemicals and completely clean the silver.
 Use a new silver polishing or microfiber cloth to dry the silver. Do this immediately after rinsing to avoid the formation of new water spots on the metal. Give a final polish to your silver, and youâ€™re done!

 The volume for any prism can be found by using the formula V=Ah{\displaystyle V=Ah}, where V{\displaystyle V} equals the volume of the prism, A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of one base, and h{\displaystyle h} equals the height of the prism.

The base of a prism is one of its congruent sides. The base of a triangular prism will be a triangle. The sides will be rectangles.
 If you do not know the volume, you cannot use this method.

For example, if you know the volume of the prism is 840 cubic meters (m3{\displaystyle m^{3}}), then your formula will look like this:840=Ah{\displaystyle 840=Ah}


, To find the area, you need to know the length of the triangle’s base and the height of the triangle. Use the formula A=12(b)(h){\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}(b)(h)} to find the area of a triangle.

Alternatively, if you know the length of all three sides of a triangle, you can find the area using Heron’s formula. Read Calculate the Area of a Triangle for complete instructions.

For example, if the base of the triangle is 12 meters, and the height of the triangle is 7 meters, to find the area you would calculate:A=12(12)(7){\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}(12)(7)}A=12(84){\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}(84)}A=42{\displaystyle A=42}


, Make sure you are substituting for the variable A{\displaystyle A}.

For example, if you found the area of the base to be 42 square meters, then your formula will look like this:840=42h{\displaystyle 840=42h}


, This will give you the height of your prism.

For example, if your equation is 840=42h{\displaystyle 840=42h}, you would need to divide each side by 42 to find h{\displaystyle h}.Thus:84042=42h42{\displaystyle {\frac {840}{42}}={\frac {42h}{42}}}20=h{\displaystyle 20=h}

So, the height of your triangular prism would be 20 meters.

 Once a week, check your Rough Collie’s ears for redness or signs of infection (e.g. discharge or odor). If you see waxiness or dirt inside of the ear, clean it carefully. Brace your dog’s ear gently and wipe the inside of it with a wet cotton cloth.Contact your veterinarian immediately if you see signs of infection.
 Gently pull back your dog’s lips to reveal its teeth. Remove any visible plaque or tartar with a dental scraper (available at pet stores) or with your fingernail. Gently brush your dog's teeth, or feed it a dental treat. If any signs of irritation or infection are evident (e.g. redness, swelling, or strong odor), bring your dog to the vet for a complete dental check up to rule out any serious issues.
 While many dog owners prefer to have their pet’s nails trimmed at the groomer’s, or by a veterinarian during a routine check up, it is possible to trim your dog’s nails on your own. With your dog laying on its side, brace its paw and look for the quick, a pink vein attached to the nail bed. Using dog clippers (available at pet stores), clip the nail as much as you can without hitting the vein. Pet and praise your dog throughout the process.If you do hit the vein, stop the bleeding by dabbing the nail into a bar of soap.

 If you're taking seeds from a fresh pumpkin, you'll need to remove the seeds first. Remember, cut a circle around the stem of the pumpkin. Remove the section you cut by lifting the stem and then scoop out the pulp and seeds using your hands. To clean, you can place the seeds in a strainer and run them under cool water in your sink.


Be sure to get most of the pulp off, especially if you're cooking the seeds in the oven. You do not want them to burn.
Set the seeds out on an open surface and pat them dry with a paper towel. If they're still slightly wet, you may have to wait a bit before you begin shelling them.
You can roast the seeds before shelling them if you prefer them cooked.
 You may not want to shell a large amount of pumpkin seeds for a big recipe. If you just want to eat the pumpkin seeds, you can shell them as you go. To start, pick up a single pumpkin seed. Fold the seed slightly.To fold, hold one half of the seed between your thumb and index finger. Grasp the other end of the seed using your thumb and index finger with your other hand.
Fold the seed in half. Keep folding until the shell cracks slightly. This should not take too much effort, and pumpkin shells are not particularly rough.
 Once the shell has cracked, you can simply pluck the shell off using your fingers. Dig your thumb into the crack you made and pull upward until the shell cracks in half completely. Pull one half of the shell off, and then the other.If there are any small bits of shell remaining, consider running the seed under water to remove.

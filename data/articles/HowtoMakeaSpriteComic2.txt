 (If you have more than one sheet repeat this step for each one.) OR, if you saved the sheet(s) on your hard drive, just open the file. Then open up another paint program and expand the canvas until it is the size you want.
 Then paste the important things, like the ground, and background items, such as trees and buildings.
 Copy/paste your characters into the box,but remember to have "draw opaque" on or you will have those unwanted white boxes, taking note of position, pose, and spacing. If you want, you can combine two together for an extremely funny pose!

, Using the text box tool on Paint, type whatever the character will say in the situation. Make sure to keep it sensible. A character on fire WOULDN'T say "I am cold." Also make sure to have the box not in the way of anything important and have the box all one color, preferably white

,, If you don't, and the original spriter who edited/sprited from scratch the character you're using, expect fireworks.

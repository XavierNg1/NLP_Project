, A small amount of food will cool faster than a large amount of food. If you are trying to cool off a solid, such as a piece of steak or a potato, try cutting it into smaller pieces. If you are trying to cool off a liquid, try pouring it into a larger, but shallower containerâ€”or into two, smaller containers.
 The moving air will help shift the heat away from your food. Be sure to stir the food often so that it cools evenly. If you don't have a fan, try fanning it with a stiff sheet of paper or folder instead. You can also blow on your food, in a pinch.
 The food closest to the surface will cool down the fastest. By stirring your food up, you will be bringing the hot food up to the surface so that it can cool down. The already-cool food will sink to the bottom and help cool the rest of your meal down.

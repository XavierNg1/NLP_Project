 If you have nothing to do at work and you notice that your coworker is swamped, ask them if they need a hand.This will eliminate your boredom productively, improve your relationship with your coworker, and potentially improve your standing in the office.


If you offer to help your coworker, don’t expect anything in return. You’re not doing them a favor, you’re lending them a hand.;
, If you find yourself standing around without any tasks, become an overachiever.For example, shelve two racks of shoes instead of one. Your boss will notice that you’re taking the initiative without being asked.

Don’t complete a task that was assigned to someone else. They may interpret your enthusiasm as an insult and resent you for it.
 If you’re under-stimulated at work then you may not be challenged enough. If this is the case, ask your boss if you can permanently take on more responsibilities.This will make your boss see you as a hardworking, dedicated employee.

Don’t make any promises that you don’t intend to follow through on. Your boss will think you’re flaky instead of hard-working.
Only ask your boss for extra work if you’ve been doing all of your duties perfectly for several months. Otherwise they may tell you to get a handle on your current workload first.
 If you’re bored because you feel you’re your job is monotonous, try to shake things up.This will bring excitement and variety into your day. For example:

If you can work remotely, try working from a coffee shop.
If you normally sort the returned clothing just before your shift ends, sort it when you get to work instead.
If you take your lunch break at noon, take it an hour or two later to vary your schedule.

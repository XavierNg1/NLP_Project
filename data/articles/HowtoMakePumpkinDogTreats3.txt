 Believe it or not, there is a recipe for pumpkin treats that you’ll love as much as your dog. You’ll need half a cup of canned pumpkin puree, one cup of whole wheat flour, a cup of quick cut oats, a tablespoon of coconut oil, an egg, and a quarter cup of Greek yogurt.In terms of spices to make these more palatable to humans, you’ll also need half a teaspoon of vanilla, one tablespoon of honey, and a teaspoon each of ginger and ground cinnamon.
Pulse or otherwise blend the oats until they’re half powder.
 In addition to preheating the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), you’ll also need to grease a muffin tin to bake your treats in. A mini muffin tin works best, and will yield more treats overall. After mixing all of the ingredients in a large bowl, thin the mixture with water until it’s malleable.Fill individual cups in the tin two-thirds of the way with the batter.
 The muffins are finished when their tops are golden brown. For added aesthetic appeal, feel free to sprinkle oats on top of the muffins right when they come out of the oven.Allow the muffins to cool in the tin. Store your muffins in the fridge for a few weeks, or fin the freezer for up to three months.
 Raw pumpkin seeds are also good for both you and your dog on their own. The seeds’ fatty acids may be especially beneficial for dogs with joint, skin, or coat conditions. Only give your dog one seed at a time, or crush them completely and add them to your dog’s food.

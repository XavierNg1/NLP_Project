 While they might want to wear their favorite animal onesie day in and day out, you will have to pick out some nice clothes for your kids. For girls, dresses in bright colors or floral patterns are a great option. Boys can wear corduroys or khakis and a collared shirt. Other clothing ideas include:


For girls: A dress and sweater; a skirt and blouse; some khakis, a blouse, and a sweater.
For boys: Khakis and a button up shirt; corduroys and a sweater; slacks and a polo shirt.
 While it’s important to keep the dress code in mind, you also don’t want fidgeting children making a ruckus at the baptism. When picking out their outfits, like the ones listed in the previous step, make sure that the materials are comfortable and loose fitting. If possible, let your kids pick out which fancy clothes they want to wear--they will be happier if they’ve picked out what they want to wear.


You can skip the tights for your little girls--this is a semi-formal event and there is no need to squish them into tights unless specifically asked to do so by the church or family that is having the baptism.
 Like tights, fancy, uncomfortable kids shoes are probably not necessary. However, it is your call. If you do decide to have your kids wear dress shoes, make sure to bring comfortable shoes that they can change into for the reception.

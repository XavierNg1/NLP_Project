 The first step is to think of a name for your monster, it can be as cool, crazy or scary as you like or you can give it a name like Bob or Billy.;
, When coming up with a monster character it is important to think about what kind of monster it is, it could be a vampire, a Were-creature, an alien, a zombie or even a wacky monster species of your creation. The only limit is your imagination.
 It can be almost anywhere, it can even be in your own neighborhood, there is no limit when it comes to monster making.
 Write up a profile for your monster including his/her appearance, personality, traits, skills/powers, monster friends, enemies, hobbies and where it lives - or if they are a bad guy monster you can replace the hobbies bit with 'Strategy' and put 'Weakness' at the bottom and write down what their weaknesses are.
 You can either do a drawing or painting of what they look like, or if you're not good at those you can use a program like HeroMachine.
 If there is more than one monster in your story, you can make them either a friend or enemy of your monster. You can make up your own bad guy monsters for your monster character to fight if he/she is a hero, or his/her own minions if he/she is a villain or villainous.
 Storytelling is a great visual medium, you can use this to write up lots of stories about your monster and his friends.
 If there are a few things that need fixing like spelling errors and such, it doesn't hurt to give it up a touch-up.
 Now that you have created your very own monster it is time that you share him/her/it with the world, you can do this by printing out the various different stories you have written about them and reading them with your friends, you can also go on sites like DeviantART and register.

Go out and buy some new underwear or some exciting lingerie.You can keep your new, sexy undergarments a secret until you are ready to be intimate, or you can build anticipation by leaving them out sometime when you are going to be gone in the evening, with a note saying "wait up for me tonight," or something along those lines., Many couples, after awhile, get into a rut when it comes to intimacy. There are certain days or times that it's most convenient to make love, and so that's when it happens. Surprise your spouse by initiating sex at an unusual time.

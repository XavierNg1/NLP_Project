 The digital distribution of press releases creates an opportunity to expand what you can tell your audience. By creating a professional-quality video, you create the opportunity to tell your audience more about your news for 30 seconds to a few minutes in a more compelling medium.
 A good quality picture can increase the likelihood of press release use by 15 to 25 percent. Choosing up to 3 images may also increase your ranking and encourage bloggers and news agencies to pick up the story.


Use the alt-tag when you post your image on the press release URL. This is the alternative image attribute that appears for non-visual users. Write a concise description with keywords, and your image will be more likely to be picked up by image search engines. Ask your web programmer if you do not how to do this.
 Google News and other engines do not list stories when the URL changes every week. Choose a simple URL with a keyword in it that is easy to navigate to from your home page, and post the press release there.

 Taking this supplement alone will not cause you to lose weight unless you also change your diet and increase your level of physical activity. You don’t necessarily need a special diet. Eating nutritious meals and snacks throughout the day is a great place to start. You should also remove sweets, processed food, and sweetened soft drinks in order to lose weight.


You don’t need to start running marathons to get active. Start with smaller steps that will increase your activity level, help you move around more, and keep you healthy. Begin with walking, gardening, hiking, swimming, playing golf, or playing tennis. Then, work your way up to higher level activities.;
, There have been no scientific studies to date that prove garcinia cambogia can help you lose weight. But, a number of studies have suggested that if you use garcinia while avoiding certain foods, you may increase your weight loss, especially around your waist. You should limit your intake of high fiber foods, particularly around the time you take the garcinia.


This means you don’t want to eat the high fiber foods with every meal because you take garcinia 30-60 minutes before meals. To get your daily fiber intake, eat high fiber snacks outside of this window.
These snacks include nuts, granola bars, kale chips, fruit, especially those with edible rinds like apples, cherries, and plums, and raw vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, and celery.
 You should also avoid foods that have too much fat or too much sugar. This includes fast food, chips and dips, cakes, pies, bacon, mayonnaise, candy, and chocolate. These all have a high fat or sugar content, and some of them have both.


You should also limit you intake of breads, potatoes, pasta, and sauces thickened with wheat flour.
Focus more on fish , lean meats such as turkey, chicken, and lean beef, and leafy green vegetables such as spinach and arugula.

 At the very least, you'll need people to play Harry, Ron, Hermione, and perhaps Draco Malfoy or Dumbledore. However, the more people you can get, the more fun you can have with your roleplay.


Consider having a friend advertise in Jamaa so you can recruit more people and tell everybody how everything works.
 Put the finishing touches on your version of Hogwarts, and make sure it's ready for all the students to arrive.
 Once you get at least 20 people, tell them to wait in line in the dining hall behind the chair. Have everyone say who they are and pick the house they are in - there isn't a talking hat to do it for them. Let everyone introduce themselves before beginning the roleplay.
 Tell everyone about the point competition, how at the end of the year, whichever house gets the most points by the end of the year wins. Describe what you'll be roleplaying and how it will work, and make sure everyone is clear on any rules that you want to establish. Setting everything up in the beginning will make for a more fun experience for everyone.
 Show everyone their dormitories. Tell everyone their schedules for classes. Get into character, and have fun!

 The controller's triggers only go so far and only need a little jolt to shoot. This is why it is often useful onlyÂ push them down a little bit to increase your reaction time. Many modded controllers have stops on them to improve this, so upgrading your controller may be a viable option.
 When sniping it only ever useful to camp when you know you're secure. if this not the case, on a map, move around a lot and only aim down the sight for no more than 15-20 seconds to try to hard scope.
 Some people can run and gun very well with the sniper, while others are better suited laying prone in the back of the map. Play a few games playing both to figure out what style suits you best.

 Use a periodic table and remember that certain isotopes of an element may have a different number of neutrons.;
, Multiply the amount of protons by its mass in atomic mass units (approximately 1.007276u) and add it to the amount of neutrons multiplied by its mass (approximately 1.008665u). Note that your teacher may provide you a specific value to use for these masses, or specify how many significant digits you are required to use.
 This difference is the mass defect! You can convert it to kilograms and use Einstein's E=mc^2 to calculate the binding energy required to hold the nucleus together.

 Blood testing is a common initial step in testing for EPI, although the blood-test results can only confirm problems symptomatic of EPI; results from bloodwork alone cannot be used to fully diagnose EPI. When your blood is submitted to a lab, its red-blood count will be determined, since anemia (low red-blood cell count) is a common condition in patients suffering from EPI.The lab work will also test your blood for an unusually high presence of nutrients that would usually be absorbed by a body producing healthy levels of pancreatic enzymes. These nutrients include iron, vitamin B12, and folate.
 Since the digestive tract is the bodily system most effected by EPI, evaluating a stool sample is an effective way to gauge a body’s digestive health. For an elastase test, you’ll need to provide your doctor with a single solid stool sample, which will be sent to a lab and evaluated for an enzyme known as “elastase.”This enzyme plays an important role in breaking down food during the digestive process. Individuals with EPI tend to have uncommonly low levels of elastase.
 In addition (or instead of) the stool sample for the elastase test, your physician may ask you to provide a stool sample for a 3-day fecal test. To produce the required sample, you’ll need to collect samples of your stool over a 3-day period and deliver them to your doctor. Similarly to a fecal elastase test, a 3-day test will also be sent to a lab, where the amount of fat that the stool contains will be tested.Excessively fatty stool is a sign of EPI, since it indicates that the digestive tract is not adequately absorbing fat from digested foods, and consequently that enzymes produced in the pancreas are not present in normal quantities.

 Although you can harvest tarragon throughout its growing season, the best time to harvest is in the late summer.This is when the plantâ€™s aroma and flavor are at their fullest. At this point, you should pick a large quantity and preserve some leaves for later use.Do not cut off the entire stock. Just remove the fresh lighter green leaves.
Be sure not to harvest more than one-third of the leaves from your plant. Harvesting too many leaves may weaken or kill it.
 After you have harvested the leaves, tie the tarragon into loose bundles and hang them out to dry in a warm, arid, airy place. There needs to be enough air circulation to ensure that the leaves properly dry. It is also important that the leaves dry quickly. Otherwise, they may mold and get discolored, which will ruin them.If stored in a cool, dark cupboard, your dried tarragon should last one to three years.
You can also dry tarragon in a vegetable dehydrator or in an oven on its lowest heat setting.
 Once you have harvested your tarragon, rinse the leaves and chop them up. Then, place the diced herbs on a tray in the freezer. Once they are completely frozen, place tarragon in freezer bags and seal. After they are thawed out, the herbs can be used as a seasoning.Once frozen, your tarragon should keep its flavor for several months.
Do not use thawed tarragon as a garnish. The frozen leaves will still hold their flavor, but the texture will be dry and crunchy.

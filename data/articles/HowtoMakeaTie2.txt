 This pattern is a simple and versatile style. You can find different variations of outlines that range in width and length. Simply print out the one you prefer and make sure that it is the classic tie pattern and has a diamond cut at the bottom.
 If you're using a fabric other than silk, you should preshrink it by washing and drying it before you iron. This will ensure the fabric doesn't shrink if you have the tie steamed or washed.









If the interfacing has not been preshrunk, preshrink it by soaking it in hot water for 10 minutes, then letting it dry and running an iron over it., Before you begin cutting, be sure to iron the back of the fabric on a low setting to remove any wrinkles, folds or ripples that will cause you to cut the fabric unevenly. To iron, lay the fabric flat on your work surface, "wrong" side up, and move the iron in small circles along the material.

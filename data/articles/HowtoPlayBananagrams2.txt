 There will be 144 lettered tiles to turn over. If you'd like to play a quicker game, take out a few of the tiles to shorten it up. But don't take out certain letters! You'll need a good combination to make the best words., Put the rest to the side (still faced down). If you are only playing with 2-3 people, feel free to increase the personal pile to 9. Each personal pile should be directly in front of the player to which they belong.

Some people get very picky about their letters, even if they're faced down. Let each player choose their tiles if need be.
 If each player would like to hide their tiles, they can, but it's unnecessary. This is more about working together and getting all the tiles used than anything.

If you'd like, each player can help the other out, too. Player A could say, "Hey, Juan! That "S" of yours could go on the end of "BANANA." If you add that, then I can add, "SUPERB." This will make the game go much more quickly. However, if you want to have each man on his own, that's fun (and competitive) too.
 If they can't go, they must skip a turn until they can. This encourages each player to tack on a letter or two to other already-formed words, making for a more exciting board.

To keep track of how often a player runs out, consider having them take fewer or more tiles each time. The second time they draw, they could take 8, the third time, 9. This way better, faster players are given a larger load to bare, helping out those who are just getting the hang of it.
 If you'd like, you can make it more competitive by keeping track of who had the longest words, who got rid of their tiles the fastest, or who helped out the board the most. Where do your strengths lie? How about your friends'? And remember -- have fun!

 Now that you have your rolls of wire, it’s time to start cutting and building a cage.

From the 1”x2” wire, use wire cutters to cut six pieces to the lengths you require. For example if you were building a cage that was 24”x48’ you would cut 4 pieces at 48” and 2 pieces at 24”.






Cut a piece of your tighter-meshed floor wire as well. Make sure it's the same length as the longer pieces you just cut.






Using C-rings, attach the two smaller pieces of wire you cut to one of the longer pieces in order to create the back and sides of the cage.
 Don’t get carried away and just start attaching everything at once. Remember that you still want to add a divider and leave room for a drop tray.

Take the section of floor wire, the one with the tighter mesh, and use C-rings to attach this to the cage, but not at the very bottom. Attach it about several inches from the very bottom to allow yourself space to add the drop tray.






Attach the front of the cage, again using C-rings






Punch holes in the edges of your divider and attach it with C-rings to the inside of the cage. Make sure your divider leaves enough room for your rabbit to move around freely from area to area.






Put the top on the cage and make sure to attach the divider to this as well.






You can now attach the final piece of wire on the very bottom of the cage, which can be used to hold the drop tray.






Use your wire cutters to cut an opening at the front of the cage so you can slide the drop trays in and out.
 Now you have a great cage, but unfortunately nothing can get in or out.

Cut an opening in the front of the cage and be sure to cover the exposed edges with plastic trim.






From the spare wire that you have left, cut a piece for your door that is slightly bigger than the hole you made in the cage.
 Take the piece of wire that you cut and attach it to the using C-rings so that it adequately covers the opening you created. Attach a latch to make sure that the door stays shut.

 At least one tab should be present to be able to reopen the accidentally closed tab.


If you close the last tab, the browser will also automatically close, clearing your tab history.;
, The closed tab will reopen in a new tab window for you to view once more.


Pressing the key combination will reopen the latest tab you closed; press it again and the tab you closed before that will open, and so on so forth.
If your Google Chrome is installed on a Mac OS, the key combination is CMD + SHIFT + T.

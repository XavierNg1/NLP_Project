 To remove rust and similar corrosion from most coins, try S100 Polishing Soap. You may be surprised at how well this removes rust from coin surfaces. It is also well suited to silver coins, and it is used by German silversmiths to clean silver jewelry. Silver cleaning wadding or batting products are sometimes helpful since these wool or cotton fibers help clean uneven surfaces on coins. Weiman metal polish should do the trick, along with many other brands.
 Try the automobile section of your local department store to find a variety of metal polishes and cleaners that can also be used to clean metal coins. You can use silver cleaner, copper cleaner, or other metal cleaner – but the results of any product will be most effective if you're using it on the type of metal for which it is advertised.
 Again, only if these coins aren't being cleaned for the purposes of coin collecting – such as in a collection of coins with any emphasis on building monetary value. Be sure to follow all of the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations whenever using ultrasonic cleaning devices.

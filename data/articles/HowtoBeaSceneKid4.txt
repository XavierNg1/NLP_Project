 "Scene" music includes Dot Dot Curve, Brokencyde, Owl City, Blood on the Dance Floor, Millionaires, Scene Kidz, Breathe Carolina, 3!OH3, Family Force 5, I Set My Friends on Fire and Jeffree Star.


Other than the likes of 3!OH3 or Breathe Carolina, try electronicore, too. Electronicore fuses electro-pop with melodic metalcore and stuff. Try stuff like Attack! Attack, I See Stars, Memphis May Fire, Enter Shikari, Woe is Me, Capture the Crown, Make Me Famous and Abandon All Ships. You can also try bands like Pierce the Veil if you want. Electropop and dance-pop is recommended, too. Even these artists and groups sometimes cite pop stars as influences or even appear on a compilation series called "Punk Goes Pop". Try Katy Perry, Carly Rae Jepsen or Nicki Minaj. You could also try dubstep and house/techno/dance/etc like Skrillex, Knife Party and deadmau5.
There are many bands or artists mislabeled as scene. Many people think deathcore, for example, is scene. It isn't. Deathcore is a hybrid of death metal (Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, Brain Drill, Dying Fetus) and metalcore (Hatebreed, Converge, While She Sleeps). Metalcore fuses metal music with beatdown hardcore (Death Before Dishonor, Madball, Comeback Kid). Metal, death metal and hardcore punk all have nothing to do with the scene style. Many think this because of the appearances of a few deathcore bands. However, a band that shows the typical image of a deathcore band would be Rose Funeral, Oceano, The Red Chord or Despised Icon. Also, here is some other music mislabeled as scene:
Hollywood Undead - Obviously rap rock
Asking Alexandria - Metalcore/synthcore
iwrestledabearonce - Experimental mathcore
Falling in Reverse - Glam metal/easycore
The Devil Wears Prada - Melodic metalcore
Suicide Silence - deathcore
Black Veil Brides - Glam rock
Of Mice & Men - Metalcore
All Time Low - Pop rock
Paramore - Emo pop

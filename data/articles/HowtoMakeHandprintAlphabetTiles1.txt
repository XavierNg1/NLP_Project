 Are you going to use them to tile your child’s bathroom or will you give them as a gift? Knowing how you will be using the tiles will dictate how you approach the project.;
, Once you know how you will use the tiles, you can determine the tile size. Of course you will need tiles that are large enough to hold your child’s handprint so measure your child’s hand before choosing tiles.
 Are you tracking your child’s growth and plan to add a new tile every few months or every year or do you want to simply capture a moment in time.


Tracking your child’s growth. If you plan to track your child’s growth, consider how often you want to add to your collection. If you start at birth and do one hand tile per year you may be asking your teenage to young adult child to add to your collection every year. Since kids grow quickly, you could add to it in the beginning every month and then as your child’s growth slows you can add yearly.
Capturing his/her small hand as a child. If you are capturing a moment in time, consider your child’s age and patience level. Although you may want that tiny handprint from when he’s six months old, it may not be practical to have a six month old sit for 26 tiles for a handprint.
Create as a keepsake for a grandparent or parent. If you are planning to give the tiles as a gift, think about how your recipient might use the tiles? Perhaps he/she mentioned something about wanting to tile a portion of the back patio or even consider using them to tile over a stone patio set. Take the recipient’s needs into consideration first before you start the project.

 You can do this by moisturizing your skin every morning and night, and washing your face and neck before and go to sleep. Be sure to drink plenty of water and eat healthy foods.;
, You should always try to shower once a day, but only use shampoo every two to three days or else your hair will become dry. However, if your hair is greasy, always shampoo twice every time you take a shower and massage it into your scalp. Use conditioner only on your roots to prevent damaging.
 No one wants to sit near someone who smells. Make sure you use deodorant or antiperspirant, and try to use mouthwash or breath mints for your breath.
 Walk with your head held high and remember to have nice posture. Write down a list of things that you like about yourself and put it on your bedroom wall or in your purse, so if you ever feel down you can feel confident again!

, A smile is the most attractive thing anyone can have. Go to the dentist every six months or so and brush your teeth twice a day. Flossing is always the most important thing you can do, so floss after every meal or at least three times a day.
 This doesn't mean that you need to buy the best, most expensive clothes every day, but try to look presentable while choosing a style that you like. If you like dressing casually, wear a T-shirt and some jeans or leggings. If you like to be sporty, wear some shorts and a loose-fitting shirt. Clothes are a big part of looking and feeling good, but never spend too much money on all your clothes, but sometimes you can treat yourself to some new sneakers or a nice purse.
 If you have good friends, they can help you feel confident and happy, and can make you laugh and have fun. Friends are always good, no matter what you are trying to do, and they will help you through anything you need them to do.

 Choose a design that you know will please your recipient. Vintage and antique handkerchiefs can be found in a variety of places, such as antique stores, online stores/auctions, thrift stores, and so forth. Even a family member might have some, if you don't already collect them.;
, The gift will need to be smaller than the handkerchief, hence this is ideal for pieces of jewelry in a small box, figurines, antique what-nots, etc. The gift must be placed inside a small box that the handkerchief will cover.
 Place the box in the center of the old handkerchief. Pull up the edges of the handkerchief around the box and gather together in the middle. A top-knot should form.
 Try to choose ribbon or lace fitting with the handkerchief's era and design.
 In the middle of the box, tie or clip on an antique/old embellishment. This could be an old brooch, an old artificial flower, something pulled off an antique piece of clothing, etc. Use your imagination for this.
 The gift is now ready for your vintage-loving recipient.

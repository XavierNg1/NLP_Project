 Buy a white baseball cap, with or without a pink bill. If you can only find a plain white one, you could always colour the bill pink using fabric paint or markers. Put a decal on the front, either iron on or paper. Finally, cut large ears out of felt and glue them onto the top of your cap.
 You can make the envelope out of felt, fabric, or paper, and then sew or glue it onto the front of them.,

 Once you have the required education and experience, you can market yourself as a CMS expert. Choose to market yourself in 1 of the following ways:


Become a freelance web developer or CMS expert. You will need to set up a corporation or sole proprietorship where you market your CMS services to small or large businesses. You should be able to evaluate all the CMS options and tell your customer what would work best. Keep in mind that you will need to be available to your customers, in case of problems with their CMS.
Seek a job at a CMS consulting firm. Although there are not many firms that specialize directly in CMS, there is a growing demand for people who can look at all the options and suggest what's best according to a company's needs.
Seek a job in CMS development. Either create your own CMS, if you think you have an idea on how to make and improve upon what is available now, or look for jobs with leading CMS programs. Any evaluated work on open source CMS development will help you to get a job in this industry.

 The gradient generalizes the derivative to functions of multiple variables. When you take a gradient, you must input a scalar function - calculating the gradient then outputs a vector function, where the vectors point in the direction of greatest increase. In the diagram above, the gradient is represented by the blue vector field.

The gradient is recognized by grad{\displaystyle \operatorname {grad} }, or the nabla symbol ∇{\displaystyle \nabla } called the del operator, which can be written out as ∇=(∂∂x,∂∂y,∂∂z).{\displaystyle \nabla =\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial x}},{\frac {\partial }{\partial y}},{\frac {\partial }{\partial z}}\right).} Gradients are most commonly taken in three dimensions.

The gradient is not defined for a vector field. It only takes in scalar functions.

In Cartesian coordinates, the gradient of a function f(x,y,z){\displaystyle f(x,y,z)} is ∇f=∂f∂xi+∂f∂yj+∂f∂zk,{\displaystyle \nabla f={\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}{\mathbf {i} }+{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}{\mathbf {j} }+{\frac {\partial f}{\partial z}}{\mathbf {k} },} where i,j,k{\displaystyle {\mathbf {i} },{\mathbf {j} },{\mathbf {k} }} are unit vectors pointing in the x, y, and z axes, respectively.
,


∂f∂x=5y2+6x2z2{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}=5y^{2}+6x^{2}z^{2}}


∂f∂y=10xy+6{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}=10xy+6}


∂f∂z=4x3z{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial z}}=4x^{3}z}


, 

Therefore, ∇f=(5y2+6x2z2)i+(10xy+6)j+(4x3z)k{\displaystyle \nabla f=(5y^{2}+6x^{2}z^{2}){\mathbf {i} }+(10xy+6){\mathbf {j} }+(4x^{3}z){\mathbf {k} }}

Note that we have mapped from a scalar field to a vector field.

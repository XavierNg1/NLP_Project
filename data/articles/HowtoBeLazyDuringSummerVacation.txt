 It's hard to be lazy if your pants itch and you get very sweaty in your shirt that doesn't fit right, so wear loose t-shirts and shorts. Don't even think about putting any shoes on. Bare feet are ideal for laziness, especially in the summer.;
, Lie on your back or on an inner tube and let yourself relax. This lets off steam and relaxes your entire body.
 If you're looking for a big project, consider buying or renting an entire television season.
 During the school year, you probably had to get up early for school and stay up late doing homework. On summer vacation, you don't have any commitments or things to do. It's the perfect time to catch up on your sleep.
 Talk at home, play video games, or go window shopping. Having a fun companion can keep you company if you're bored and help you relax.
 Waste time or live in the moment. Try to take a nap or just sit on the couch and think! If thinking is too tiring, just lay back and relax!

, If you have a birthday in the summer, this can be more relaxing since you don't have to go anywhere and it's cheaper! If possible, have your parents leave the house, go on a date, or something to keep you and your friends to your privacy. This is a great way to chill, especially if you have over-protective parents!

, Having a bath or shower is the perfect time to relax and think.
 Try knitting or coin collecting.

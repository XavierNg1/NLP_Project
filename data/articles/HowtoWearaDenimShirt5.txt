 If the shirt has a collar and the dress is low-cut enough, try wearing a long-sleeve denim shirt beneath a sleeveless dress. Otherwise, wear the shirt unbuttoned over the dress. Match the look with closed-toe heels or fashion boots and simple accessories.
 The infamous little black dress is another fashion staple. A simple black dress becomes day-friendly when paired with an open-button denim shirt and black fashion boots or flats. Stick with a more structured shirt, though, especially one that is shorter or cropped.
 For a fresh look fool of summer fun, try wearing an open-button denim shirt with a sundress. Light washes work best for this since the lightness creates a more spring- or summer-appropriate feeling. If you opt for a loose flowing maxi dress, match it with a loose denim shirt tied into a knot around your waist. For a shorter sundress, try a shorter cropped shirt left open and worn as a jacket.

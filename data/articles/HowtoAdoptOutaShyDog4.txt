 If you cannot find an adopter for your dog, your only other option may be surrendering it. Be choosy when looking at shelters and rescue groups. Many shelters and groups are understaffed and overcrowded with dogs waiting to get homes. Because of this, a large majority of the animals are put to sleep. There are “no-kill” shelters that will not kill your dog. However, they also tend to be overcrowded and are less likely to take your dog. Make sure that you find a place for your dog that will care for it.Avoid taking your dog to a pound. Most pounds will only hold the dog for a few days before putting it down.
 Once you have found shelters or rescue groups to contact, you should give them a call and find out more about their situation. Talk with the staff about how many animals are in their facility and the number of volunteers they have. Try to avoid locations that are overcrowded and understaffed. Generally, a shelter or group will let you know if they think they can take care of your animal.An overcrowded shelter may be a particularly stressful place for your already anxious dog.
Ask questions like “how many animals are in your facility?” and “how many staff do you have?”
You might also want to ask “what happens to dogs that are not adopted?” and “what is the living situation like for your dogs?’

, Once you have found a shelter or rescue group, arrange a time to surrender your dog. Most shelters and groups have their own policies, but your appointment should only last about an hour. You will bring your dog in, it will receive a quick medical evaluation and then you will sign a form surrendering it.Be sure that you understand the policies of the shelter or rescue group.
Most shelters or rescue groups will try to work with you to avoid having you surrender the dog. Volunteer staff may explore options for you to keep the dog or find someone else to take it.

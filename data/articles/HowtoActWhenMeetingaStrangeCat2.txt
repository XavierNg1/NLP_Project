 It is best to meet the cat in an open space, so they don’t feel cornered by you. Don’t move towards the cat, particularly not in a way that would make it feel trapped, for example if it is in an enclosed cat carrier. While it can be tempting to approach the cat, try to let the cat make the first move.You may notice that the more you ignore the cat, the more curious they are about you.
 Once the cat shows some interest by approaching you, get lower to the ground so you are not hovering over the cat. Try sitting cross-legged on the ground, so you are physically less intimidating. Cats are small creatures; the smaller you can make yourself, the better., If the cat approaches you, try to let the cat become acquainted with your smell. Extend your open palm so the cat can smell you and become familiar with you. If the cat shrinks at your hand, you can try extending something you’re wearing, such as your glasses., If the cat seems curious and receptive to your hand, attempt to scratch their chin or cheeks. These areas contain scent glands that release calming pheromones when rubbed. Most cats also enjoy being petted on these parts of the body.If the cat begins to purr or rub on your leg, that is a positive sign. Don’t try to pick up the cat or place them in your lap.
Avoid petting the cat at the base of the tail or on the belly right away.

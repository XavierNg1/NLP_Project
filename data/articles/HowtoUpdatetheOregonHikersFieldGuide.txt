 This is optional, but extremely helpful.;
, You can see a list of all the Columbia River Gorge hikes here. This is a very popular hiking area in the summer.
 An easy way to save it is to take screenshots of the guide.
, Intersections are where people get confused and lost.


Sometimes you come across an intersection that isn't noted in the guide. If this happens, do your best to describe the intersection and if you have GPS, record the coordinates.
If you can't find an intersection that is described in the guide, make note of that too. If you do end up finding it, record GPS coordinates for it, and try to think of ways you can describe it in a way that'll make the person reading the guide find it more easily.
Make note of any signs are present that aren't in the guide. Sometimes new signs are put up, but no one has updated the guide yet. This is important information to add. Take a picture of the sign and get GPS coordinates. If the guide says there is a sign, but it isn't actually there, make note of this too.
 Put the name of the hike in the title of the thread. In your post, describe what is incorrect in the field guide and what needs to be added. Be as specific as possible. Someone will follow up and update the guide.


If you recorded a GPS track, provide a link to it. One option for uploading your GPS track for public use is to Upload a GPS Trace to OpenStreetMap.
Include any pictures you took, with detailed descriptions. See How to Upload Images in BBCode.

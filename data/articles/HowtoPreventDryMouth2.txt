 There are over-the-counter and doctor-prescribed products that create artificial saliva and stimulate the production of natural saliva. Artificial saliva is not a complete substitute for natural saliva, since it does not contain the digestive and antibacterial enzymes that natural saliva contains. But it can be useful in relieving the discomfort of dry mouth. Artificial saliva products may be available in rinses, sprays, toothpastes or washes.


Many of these products do not require a prescription, but they are not often easy to find. Ask your pharmacist to help locate these products.Artificial saliva is rarely prescribed unless you are suffering from a severe syndrome, such as Sj√∂gren's syndrome.
 Antihistamines and decongestants dry up your mucus production, thus worsening dry mouth. If you have a cold or need to treat congestion for any reason, visit your doctor instead of taking a non-prescription decongestant.

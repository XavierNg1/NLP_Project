 Both ends of the cable must be firmly seated in their jacks to ensure optimal audio quality. Try to avoid pinching the cable at sharp angles to maintain the cable.
 If your player is frequently running out of battery while in use, you can get a car adapter to connect to the car charging port. Most modern adapters will have a USB port so that you can provide your own charging cable that is sure to fit your device.


Charging adapters connect to both the car and player separately from the aux cable, although some car adapters may also include an aux connection.
 The car stereo has its own equalizer settings that may conflict and reduce sound quality. On an iPod Touch or iPhone, go to “Settings > Music” and tap EQ under the “Playback” header, then tap “Off”.


Accessing the EQ settings will vary depending on the model of MP3 player you are using.

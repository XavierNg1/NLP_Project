 Each airline has a different seat design, but you should find a lever on the side of your seat in many cases. Pull it up to bring the seat back up. If you can't find the lever, ask a flight attendant for help., Most airlines still use seat belts that only go across your lap. Locate the buckle on one side and the latching device on the other. Straighten out each side, if necessary. Insert the buckle into the latching device. Make sure you hear a click. Pull the belt until it's snug across the tops of your thighs., Do this even if the captain turns off the “Fasten Seat Belts” sign. If you decide to recline, make sure the belt stays snug across your lap. If you're using a blanket, place it between the belt and your body.

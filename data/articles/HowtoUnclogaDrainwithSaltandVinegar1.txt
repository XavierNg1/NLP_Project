 In a small bowl, pour 1 cup of salt. Add 1 cup of vinegar. Stir well so the salt soaks up all the vinegar. Continue stirring until the mixture is smooth and even.


Add a 1/2 cup of lemon juice and mix thoroughly to give your paste some extra declogging-power thanks to the juiceâ€™s acidity.
If the clog is located deep within the pipe, or if you're leaving the lemon juice out, add more vinegar for a thinner mixture so it travels more easily.;
, First, remove the drain's stopper. Then pour the mixture directly down the drain. Coat the entire drain so the whole clog is sure to absorb the mixture. Allow it to sit for 15 minutes so the clog can absorb as much as possible. For especially stubborn clogs, let the clog soak for 30 minutes.


If you are unable to remove the stopper, add more vinegar to the mixture before pouring so it's thinner.
 Boil 2 cups of water with a kettle or pan. Then pour the water directly into the drain. Pour slowly to avoid splash-back, which may scald you. Also pour slowly so you can aim the water directly into the drain instead of splashing the basin, which may absorb the heat and cool the water on contact before it reaches the clog.


Use boiling water instead of running hot water from the tap, since it may take a while for the hot water to kick in.

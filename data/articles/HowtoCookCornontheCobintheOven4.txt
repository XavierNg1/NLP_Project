 Turn on the broiler portion of your oven and allow it to preheat for at least 5 minutes.


If your broiler has high and low settings, switch it onto high. Note that some broilers only have on and off settings; in this case, the general on setting is fine.
Make sure that the upper rack of the oven is about 6 inches (15 cm) away from the top heating element., Completely remove the husks and all visible threads from the ears of corn. Use a knife to chop each ear into four equal sections.


Depending on the thickness of the corn, it may be possible to break the ears apart by hand instead of using a knife. Doing so will give you less control over the size of the sections, though, making it harder to keep the sections even.
 Arrange the corn cob sections on a large baking sheet covered with aluminum foil. Lightly brush each section with oil or melted butter, and sprinkle the corn with salt and pepper (if desired).


Since olive oil has a higher smoking point than butter, it's usually the safer option for the broiler. Since the corn should cook quickly when sectioned, though, you should also be able to use butter without much trouble.
 Place the corn beneath the preheated broiler. Cook the cob sections for 3 to 5 minutes, or until some of the kernels begin to char, then flip them over to their other sides. Continue cooking until the other sides char, as well.


Consider brushing the other sides with additional oil and butter before returning them to the broiler. Note that doing so may result in more splatter inside your oven, though.
 Remove the corn cob sections from the oven and let them cool slightly. Sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley, if desired, and serve the corn hot.

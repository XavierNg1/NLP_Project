  Stretching not only feels good, it will help improve your flexibility, quicker than you think it could.  Stretch out all the muscles in your body, and get them ready for all the sports that you play.  Yoga is soothing and beneficial.
  In order to run fast, wear a good, high-quality pair of runners.  Make sure the shoelaces are tied if your shoes have them!  Tripping is extremely hazardous, even though you may have never tripped.  Always have your upper body in front of your lower body, and take big, fast steps with your feet.  Don't ball up your fists, instead let them loose and swing them back for better momentum, which will make you fast.
  It sounds ridiculous, but you are getting stronger everyday by running, jumping, climbing, and more on the playground!  Whenever you are making an effort to work your muscles, you are making them stronger.  So even if you may be weak, if you keep on running, jumping, and playing, you'll get strong.

 Shining a light along the edge of the wall helps you see all the ridges and dips. It's sort of like how a makeup mirror can highlight all the imperfections on your face. Some people hold a light with a cord and move it as they go, but you can also just use a lamp and direct the light along the area you're working on.You can also do all your light work first by moving around the room and shining it on different areas. You can mark points as "high," "fill," or "even" with a pencil. That way, you already know what you need to sand as you go around the room.You can also just feel for rough edges, but you're more likely to miss spots., You don't want to sand wet drywall. That's a little like trying to sand wet sand. You will get nowhere fast. Darker areas mean that it's still wet in places. If it looks even in color across the wall, you're probably good to go., You'll need to move from top to bottom. That way, the dust falls down on places you haven't done yet, rather than places you've already done. So you'll need to use a stepladder to get to the places you can't reach.

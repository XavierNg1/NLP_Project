 Make sure that you're painting in a place where water, paint, and salt won't do any damage to the table or floor.;
, Use a paintbrush and some water to moisten the surface, but avoid creating puddles of water. If puddles form, soak some water up again with paper towels.
 Use the brush, water, and paint to create a design on your page. Because of the water, your colors will bleed into each other, but that's just part of the effect. You can use several colors and create an abstract design, or you can try to create a scene like the ocean floor or sky and mountaintops.
 Be generous and random as you sprinkle, but don't use too much. You don't need mountains of salt around, but putting more in some areas and less in others will result in a more varied, interesting design.
 Because of all the water, this may take some time. Don't try to move it while it's wet, or the paper may tear.
 Take care not to spill the salt everywhere - you may want to shake it into a tray or container for easy disposal.
 Enjoy the interesting effect, and place your watercolor somewhere for the world to see!

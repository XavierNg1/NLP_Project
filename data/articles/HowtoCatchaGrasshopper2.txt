 To catch a grasshopper, try laying out a bucket or small container containing a 10:1 solution of water and molasses. To catch multiple grasshoppers, fill a pond or wading pool with the same solution.Avoid this method if you wish to catch a grasshopper alive; the insect will likely drown in the solution unless retrieved right away., Another option for catching grasshoppers on a larger scale is to set up a pane of glass and a vat of soapy water in a field. Position the pane of glass vertically, with the vat in front of it. The grasshoppers will leap at the pane of glass, fall back into the soapy water, and drown- the soap cuts the surface tension of the water, causing the grasshoppers to sink., To catch a live grasshopper, to observe or keep as a pet, lay out a fuzzy blanket in a field or other grasshopper-friendly area. To attract grasshoppers to it, spray the blanket with sugar water and sprinkle with breadcrumbs.Leave the trap overnight. Grasshoppers that move across the blanket will get their legs caught in the fuzzy fibers long enough to be picked up or collected in a container.To speed things up, agitate the grass around the blanket to drive grasshoppers to leap onto it.
 Cut off the top of an ordinary plastic bottle and reinsert it upside down, so that the opening sits inside the bottle. Tape it together and insert some grass, then leave the trap outside. Grasshoppers will get into the bottle easily by way of the funnel-like top, but they will be unable to get back out., Grasshoppers seem to be attracted by the color yellow, so setting a trap that uses this color is worth a shot to catch one.Insects see in the UV spectrum, and light colors reflect more UV light, making them more appealing.Set up a molasses trap in a yellow bucket, or a fuzzy blanket trap with a yellow blanket (or yellow accessories on the blanket) to catch a grasshopper.

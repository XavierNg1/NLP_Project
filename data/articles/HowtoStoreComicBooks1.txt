 Wrapping your collection in comic book bags will be more than enough to maintain its condition. Buy bags at your local comic or hobby shop or purchase them online, and when you do, keep these three main comic book sizes in mind:

Current (1980 to present) size: 6 7/8″ x 10 1/2″
Silver Age (1950 to 1980) size: 7 1/8″ x 10 1/2″
Golden Age (pre-1950) size: 7 3/4” x 10 1/2”;
, Cardboard backing can also be bought at most comic and hobby shops. Be sure to verify the backing you buy is acid free. Cardboard that has acid won’t likely give your comics superpowers – expect damage instead., Hard shell cases are going to cost you a couple dollars apiece, if not more. Because of this, it’s only really worth it to store rare or valuable comics in containers like these. Buy these cases from comic and hobby shops.

Hard shell cases will be easier and safer to display. You may be able to attach an adhesive hook to the case so you can display the comic on a wall.
 To have this done, you’ll need to send your comic in to a recognized authority in rare and vintage comics, like Certified Guarantee Company. Your comic will be returned to you safely encased in plastic with its condition certified by an expert.

Each certified, slabbed comic should have a protective hologram and barcode. Should these be tampered with or damaged, the certification is invalidated.

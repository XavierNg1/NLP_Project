 Minor wounds, like surface scrapes or shallow cuts, usually stop bleeding on their own after a few minutes. If necessary, cover the area with a clean cloth or bandage and apply gentle pressure. Elevate the wound if possible, so the area is held higher than the heart.For example, if you have an arm or leg injury, elevate the limb to hold the wound at a higher point than your heart.
 Run warm water over a scrape or cut to remove debris and germs. Clean around the wound with a wash cloth and mild soap or saline solution. Start cleaning the wound as soon as possible to prevent infection.Soak a puncture wound for 15 minutes in a warm saline solution to flush debris.
If necessary, dip a pair of tweezers in alcohol to sanitize them, and use them to remove particles of debris from a scrape or cut that you can’t flush with water. Consult a doctor if you can’t remove any debris from a puncture wound or deep cut.
 Use a cotton swab to cover the wound with a thin coating of antibiotic ointment. Dress the wound with a sterile bandage. If necessary, use a clean cloth to dry the area around the wound so the bandage can adhere.Be sure to change the dressing at least once a day or whenever it comes damp or dirty.
If the wound doesn’t become infected, just clean it with saline solution at least once daily or whenever you change the dressing.
 As you care for your wound, make sure to check it often for signs of an infection and call your doctor if you notice any of these signs. These signs may include:

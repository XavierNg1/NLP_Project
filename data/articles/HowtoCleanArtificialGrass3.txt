 Artificial grass is a lot less likely to collect bacterial spores than natural grass; however it’s still possible, especially if you have pets. If you only need to spray a specific spot, just use a spray bottle. If you suspect the bacteria is more widespread, attach a hose-end sprayer to a garden hose and hose down the whole turf.A hose-end sprayer looks like a plastic bottle with a spray bottle nozzle. It screws into a garden hose and is usually used to spray fertilizer., Use a garden hose to spray water on your grass. This will keep it looking fresh as well as ridding it of small spills and odors.After hosing, use a broom or a rake to brush the grass. This will keep the grass blades pointing upwards, helping your lawn look fresh.
 Snow and ice won’t damage the grass by themselves, but walking on the grass too much can cause snow to turn into a layer of ice. If this does happen, avoid the temptation to remove the ice, as this could damage the grass blades. Instead, you should wait until the snow and ice melt naturally.


Avoid using salt to melt snow or ice. The residue can damage the grass’ carpet backing and prevent the lawn from draining properly.

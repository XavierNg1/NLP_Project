 Many states require all employers to have a written employee handbook with information about company policies.Your handbook should include strong statements against discrimination in the workplace, and provide specific examples of discriminatory acts that are prohibited.Written handbooks should be given to each employee as soon as possible after the date of hire. Make sure each employee understands that the information in the handbook supersedes any statements made by supervisors or other employees.Make sure you provide a copy of your employee handbook to your attorney so he or she can evaluate its use in defending against your ethnic discrimination lawsuit., Requiring continuing education for employees and supervisors can be a strong defense against an ethnic discrimination claim.


Contact the local offices of federal or state agencies to arrange for speakers to come to your business for training sessions.For example, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which enforces a number of federal anti-discrimination laws, will provide a representative at no cost to you to explain to your employees the protections provided by federal law and the process of filing a claim.Include a uniform anti-discrimination orientation program that must be completed by all employees. This program can ensure that each employee has the same information and understands your standards of conduct.Keep in mind that prevention of claims often is the best defense. If you can prove you had strong anti-discrimination policies in place and properly educated employees, you stand a greater chance of defeating a discrimination lawsuit., If you are covered by federal law, you must display certain posters detailing your employees' rights to a discrimination-free workplace.Keep in mind that employees often report discrimination to state or federal agencies because they feel they have nowhere else to turn.Maintain an open environment and make sure employees know how to report ethnic discrimination in the workplace.
Because you are liable for discriminatory conduct by any employee, not just supervisors, it is imperative that everyone who works for you understands that harassment or intimidation of co-workers on the basis of ethnicity or other protected traits is prohibited., Your anti-discrimination policy will have little value – either to your employees or as a defense to a discrimination lawsuit – if it isn't enforced the same in all circumstances.Designate more than one employee or supervisor to handle complaints, and make sure all reports are investigated promptly.Handle all complaints the same and discipline all employees appropriately if you find evidence they are engaging in discriminatory behavior.Maintain written records of all complaints of discrimination and any ensuing investigation.When defending against an ethnic discrimination lawsuit, these records will prove that you handled the complaint promptly and investigated it thoroughly.

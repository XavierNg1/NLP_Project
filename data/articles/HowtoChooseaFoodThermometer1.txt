 Non-digital "dial" thermometers—sometimes called bi-metallic stem thermometers—are no longer your best option. Over time, the metal on these instruments expands and contracts, causing the inner workings to shift and show an incorrect temperature.Instead, digital thermometers are easily the best choice. They are easy to read, remarkably accurate, and available in a wide variety of styles.There are many types of digital thermometers, ranging in price from as little as $5 to well over $100.
Instant read thermometers, infrared thermometers, and thermocouple readers are all available in digital models.;

A less expensive, but still great, option is the Super-Fast Pocket Thermometer (RT600C) for $19 (from ThermoWorks or Amazon).
 If you’d like something a little more high-end, you may prefer to use a thermocouple reader and probes. Thermocouple readers offer flexibility and accuracy by recording temperatures at multiple locations on the food, by way of thermocouple probes.A good choice for a reader is the Therma Differential Thermocouple Meter for $129 (from ThermoWorks).
The probes are sold separately. A good choice for these is the Stainless Steel K-Type Thermocouple Insertion Probe (set of 2) for $11.99 (on Amazon).
 An infrared thermometer can provide an accurate temperature reading without ever touching the food. Simply point the infrared gun at various points on your food to get temperature readings. This is a great option is you’d like to keep the look of your food intact.A good option is the Food Safety Infrared (IRFS) for $69 (from ThermoWorks or Amazon).

 It will be made of metal or plastic and should lay flat against her sternum. Most women wear bras that fasten in the back, so check her back before you try to unclasp the front of her bra.


Though it's probably obvious what you're doing, make sure she's okay with what you are about to do. It doesn't have to be a big deal and can even be kind of sexy. Just pause and whisper "Is this okay?" If she tells you yes then you can proceed.
If she says no, don't try to force anything. Just remove your hand and enjoy kissing her.
 This relieves some of the tension in the bra. If it is not an eyelet closure, there may just be two metal or plastic pieces that snap together and lock when flat against her chest. If this appears to be the case, spread your fingers so they are on either side of the clasp.
 If the bra is fastened with a hook and eyelet, then you will make the same snapping, squeezing movement as you would with a back-fastening bra. If not, you will need to push one side of the clasp up so that it unfastens from the other side. Pinch one side of the clasp between your thumb and index finger and pull up while your middle finger pulls down on the opposite side of the clasp.


The hook is not always on the same side, so if this doesn't work, try pressing your thumb against your middle finger and pulling up while your index finger pulls down.

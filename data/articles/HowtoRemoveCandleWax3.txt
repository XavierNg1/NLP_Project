 Unlike the above methods, this method involves cooling rather than heating dried wax to make it easier to chip or scrape off of a surface. This method is a great choice if the wax is on a hard surface, such as a table or counter top, especially if the wax is too soft and gel-like to easily remove, but not liquid enough to wipe away or soak up. This also works well on non-washable fabrics like rayon and silk.


Canned air is available at most office supply stores. It's also commonly kept in any place where computers are used, like office buildings and schools, as it's often used to clean computers.
 Spray the wax with compressed air. The cool, rapidly-moving air should gradually cause the wax to cool and stiffen, becoming more brittle.
 Once the wax has hardened, use the edge of a credit card (or another similar stiff plastic item) to scrape it off. The wax should easily separate from the surface it's attached to, chipping off in brittle chunks. Repeat the blowing and scraping processes as needed.


It can be tempting to do so, but don't use a metal object (like a knife) to scrape. Metal can gouge or scratch the surface you're trying to remove the wax from, permanently marring its surface.
 When you've scraped as much wax away as you possibly can, you may notice a thin film or residue remaining. Use a little all-purpose cleaner and a wet rag to quickly soak this up and leave your surface like new.
 Using ice to freeze some stubborn wax can create minor puddles, but it's quicker and even more effective than canned air. Grab an ice cube with a rag and rub the wax, touching the ice directly to it. The colder wax gets, the more brittle it becomes, so you should have even greater success when scraping it away.

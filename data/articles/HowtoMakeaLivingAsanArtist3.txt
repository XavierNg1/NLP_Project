 While you try to land a book deal, or sell your paintings, get a part-time job. Working part-time will allow you to dedicate time and energy to your art. Try for a service job or a job with flexible hours, such as online content editing for a website.
 There are many grants available for up and coming artists. If you look up "grants for artists" or "emerging artists," you'll find many options. Besides national grants, check out foundations in your area that support local artists.
 Residencies offer you a space to live (and a studio, if you need one). The good ones cover travel expenses as well as food and offer a stipend. Doing frequent residencies is not a sustainable way to make a living, but it can be a temporary boon. Search for "artist residencies," or check out http://www.resartis.org/en/residencies/list_of_residencies/

, If you are interested in teaching, or if you just want to spend 3-6 years working on your art, taking classes, and not worrying about money, apply for a fully funded graduate program. As these programs tend to be competitive, apply to several.If you are applying somewhere and can't tell whether or not a program is fully funded, don't be embarrassed about calling the department in which it is housed and querying.
Some programs are not fully funded for all students, but do offer fellowships to some.
Some funded MFAs and PhDs require you to teach or work as a TA or RA.

 If you have access to the physical machine from which the account holder works, they may store their commonly-used passwords in a document somewhere.


Most computers allow for a cursory search of documents from within a search bar (PCs) or the Finder app (Macs). Try typing in keywords like "password", "account", and "user name" (or "username").Be sure to search for hidden files as well.
 This can be information ranging from their date of birth to their favorite pet's name. The goal here is to figure out possible answers to their security questions as well as candidates for their password itself.


For example, their favorite pet's name followed by a number might be a password.
 If you can't figure out their password based on general guesses and they don't have an explicitly labeled password file on their computer, try using everything you know about them to guess the password. Some helpful information may include the following:Personal information (e.g., their favorite pet's name) - This can help you guess their security questions, which often allow you to bypass a password if you enter them correctly.

Social media details - If you're friends with them on social media (or you know someone who is), their likes and interests listed there may be reflective of the answers to their security questions as well.
 Especially if you are a parent attempting to view a child's account or an employer investigating fraud, you probably have the authority to speak with people who may know something about your target password.

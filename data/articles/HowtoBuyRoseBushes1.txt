 Rose bushes come in mini, small, medium and large sizes. They can be shrubs or climbers and some can even be trained to grow either way.


Take a close look at the space the rose bush will occupy to determine what size bush to buy.;
, Measure the space between the plants that will be on either side or, if the rose will be next to a building, measure the area from the building to the edge of the garden or next plant.
 If the area measures only 2 feet wide by 2 feet deep, buy a miniature rose like “Live Wire” (Rosa “Savawire” “Live Wire”) that grows to only 6 to 12 inches tall and wide.“White Meidiland” (Rosa “Meicoublan” “White Meidiland”) is a popular ground-cover type rose for larger landscapes that grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and width of 4 to 6 feet. It would require a 7-foot wide area in the garden.
“Peace” roses (Rosa “Peace”) is a very popular hybrid tea rose that takes up a little less space than “White Meidiland.” With a mature height of 3 to 4 feet and width of 2 to 3 feet, it needs about 4 feet of garden space.
 Roses are commonly susceptible to fungal and bacterial diseases that flourish if air circulation is restricted.


Leaving at least 6 to 8 inches of empty space around the rose bush will reduce the frequency and severity of these common diseases.

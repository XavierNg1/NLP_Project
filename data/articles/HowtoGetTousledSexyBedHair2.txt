 Wash your hair in warm water. Apply shampoo to the roots, but try to keep the product away from the tips. Rinse.


Condition the lengths. If you're trying a new hairstyle, it's important to keep your hair healthy.
 Even a wide-tooth comb will break down the tousled appearance. If you have a shortish fringe/bangs that you'd prefer to stay straight, comb and blow dry them etc. But leave the rest of the hair unbrushed.], Towel dry your hair a little. Spray heat protection in, but don't brush or comb it in. Then, put your hair up in a "towel turban." Use a clean towel or a specialized turban cloth made for hair. If you combed out your fringe/bangs, leave those parts of your hair out of the towel wrap.
 In the morning, undo your hair from the wrap. Your hair should be dry, unless you have very thick hair or a particularly nonabsorbent towel. If your hair isn't dry in the morning, blow dry it at the roots or wherever the dampness is located.
 If your hair isn't as wavy as you want it, set your curling irons to a low heat, and wind a few random chunks around. However, only hold it for a few seconds.


Do not brush. Back-brush any bits that look too flat. Consider straightening bits of your fringe/bangs if they need it.
 You can just sleep on it. It isn't good to wash hair every day! Just sort your fringe/bangs out in the morning, and this tousled style will usually hold for a few days.

 Hypnosis is a state of deep relaxation and concentration. When someone is in a hypnotic trance, they are especially receptive to ideas and suggestions. However, it’s not possible to make a hypnotized person do anything they don’t want to do. People remain aware of their surroundings and actions during hypnosis, and they can come out of the trance whenever they want to., Hypnotherapy is used in two ways. The first is to help the client uncover repressed memories and feelings that are causing depression or other problems. The second is to use the power of suggestion to help the client build healthier thought patterns and coping strategies.Many people repress their traumatic thoughts and memories, making it harder to identify and treat them. Hypnotherapy is helpful for overcoming this because it gives therapists and clients a window into the client’s subconscious mind.
 Hypnosis is a useful tool, but by itself, it can’t treat depression or any other mental health problem. Hypnotherapy should be used as a complement to other psychotherapy techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy, which can address the problems that hypnotherapy brings to the surface., If you’re interested in adding hypnotherapy to your practice, look for a training program to be sure you understand how to do it in a safe and effective way. There are many hypnosis training courses available in person and online, but not all of them are run by qualified individuals. Look for a course that has been approved by the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis.

 If you know exactly what you want, it can help to bring in a picture, especially for a trend that not every piercer is familiar with. That way, there will be no confusion about what you want.
 Keep in mind that the "heart" part of the piercing is usually created by the piercer. That is, they take a standard hoop for cartilage, and they bend it into shape. They must take out the bead to make the shape. Once again, a picture is helpful here.Keep in mind that some piercers will prefer that you start with other jewelry while you're healing and then have this piece put in later.
 When the piercer is getting ready to pierce you, you need to stay as still as possible. That includes when the piercer is marking where the piercings will go. This step is especially important in an orbital piercing, as it takes more precision. Take slow, deep breaths, and try to hold as still as possible. Don't worry, though, the piercer will talk you through it., In general, a cartilage piercing will bleed more than a tissue piercing (like the ear lobe). Therefore, be ready for a bit of bleeding when you get a heart cartilage piercing. The body produces more blood for cartilage because it doesn't have it's own blood supply; the nearby tissue increases blood flow to the area.

 Whether you're male or female, long hair is the norm. This is mainly because you're not going to bother getting it cut! It should be clean (you still bathe!), but it doesn't have to be anything beyond that.


"Artfully disheveled" is a definite look you could pull off as a hippie. Whatever comes natural to your follicles is how you should rock your mop.
Men -- grow out your facial hair, too.
 Wear your headband horizontally over your forehead, not vertically over your hair, and accessorize it with a flower (a daisy is classic).


If you want a feather in your hair more permanently — or just don't like the idea of killing a flower in order to festoon your hair — look for a flower clip that you can put in your hair along with your headband.
If you can't find a headband, make your own with string. Try to find a stretchy fabric for your string; cotton or other, inelastic string will begin to hurt and may leave a mark on your forehead if worn for a long time.
 Leave your hair long, loose, and low-maintenance. Don't put any chemicals in it. The less you style it, the better. If you’re a man, leave your facial hair scruffy and unkempt.


If you do need to tie your hair up, put it in a low ponytail, two low ponytails, or a braid.
 Getting dreadlocks is notoriously difficult, but they're definitely worth it if you think that you can pull them off. They're a labor of love.


They're a semi-permanent labor of love, so make sure you're committed before you take the leap.
 For women, go practically bare. A bit of black kohl outlining your eyes is okay, but not much more than that.Stay away from lipstick and any outrageous, obvious coloring. You're a child of the earth, after all.

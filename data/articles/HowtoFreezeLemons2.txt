 Cutting your lemon into pieces before you freeze them will circumvent the soft consistency of the lemon so that you can use it in things like cocktails and garnishes. Cut the lemon on a cutting board width-wise about a 1/4 of an inch (6.35 millimeters) to create lemon slices. To cut the lemon in wedges, make one cut lengthwise and one cut width wise. This will create four same-sized lemon wedges.You can also cut lemon slices in half to create crescent-shaped lemon slices.
 Ensure that the lemon slices have free space in between them. Putting your lemon slices on a cookie sheet will allow them to freeze individually. If you skip this step, your lemon slices or wedges will freeze together in one block. Keep the slices of lemon the freezer for 2-3 hours, or until the lemons are frozen completely.


You will know when your lemons are frozen when they are hard, and the pulp no longer creates juice when you press down on it.
 After your lemons are completely frozen, you can transfer them to a ziplock bag to free up space in your freezer. Place the zip lock bag back into the freezer and take out slices as you need them.

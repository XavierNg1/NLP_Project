 The simple, old-fashioned pole is used by most crappie fishermen, and it's quite effective. You can use an inexpensive cane pole or a fiber or graphite pole. Lightweight poles are usually best when you're fishing for crappie. If you'd rather use a rod and reel, that's fine, too.
 Jigs by far the most popular lures used to catch crappie. Don't rely on just one, though; the elusive crappie is picky, so you'll need an array of jigs to try on any given fishing expedition. They come in different weights, shapes, and sizes. Crappie generally bite on smaller jigs.


Jigs are covered with synthetic soft bodies that are made with many different types of materials and come in all kinds of colors and textures.
Some soft bodies are made to look like a particular type of bait.
 If you'd prefer not to use a synthetic soft body, use minnows as bait. Crappie are attracted to minnows, so this is the most popular type of real bait used to fish them.

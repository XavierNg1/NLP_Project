 Model yourself in the mirror of the stores try-on section and look at how beautiful you are and good you look in the articles of clothing. Hot clothes will make any woman/girl feel attractive on the inside and out.
 Go to stores like Bobbi Brown Cosmetics; Nordstrom; M*A*C Cosmetics; Neutrogena. These are some great cosmetics brands/stores that will beautify your face. Apply two swipes of peach, pink, a golden bronze and yellow rouge to your cheekbones, some mascara and a dark shade of red and pink. These colors are so well for pale complexions.
 Go to a health spa and get treated like a queen; go to a nail department and get a mani-pedi; go to a hair stylist and have your hair done. Getting prettied up will make you feel like you are a celebrity and all people will be at service for you and you only.
 For example, for Christmas, wear a crisp white teddy with long sleeved gloves for a virtuous kind of aura and for Halloween, wear a dark petticoat of black, purple or bottle green for a look of darkness. This will indicate that you still got what it takes to be sexy.

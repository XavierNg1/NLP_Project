 Push yourself off the ground with enough force to be able to clap while in mid-air. This can be done as a plyometric exercise.
 In the plank position, instead your hands together beneath you in the shape of a diamond. Now do the push up with your hands in this form. This requires significantly more strength in your arms. To add more pressure to the chest try squeezing your hands together on the floor. The point isn't too move them it so you can get activation of the chest.
 Begin to do a standard push up or a basic variation of the push up. When you finish lowering yourself, raise one leg off the floor bend your knee towards your back and to the side. Do individual sets for each leg, or alternate between legs.
 Do a standard push up or a basic variation of push up. When you finish lowering yourself, lift one leg off the floor and pull your knee to the side up to your shoulder. Do individual sets for each leg, or alternate between legs. If done properly, this should engage the core in addition to the upper-body.
 Spread your legs further than normal (for balance), put one of your arms on your back, and proceed with the push up using one arm.
 Instead of using the palms of your hands, put your weight on your fists, using the first two knuckles of each hand. These require more strength in the arms and wrists, and are a good way to condition your knuckles for boxing or martial arts.
 If you are very strong, you can try doing push ups using only your fingers, instead of your palms.
 You can increase the difficulty of your push ups by putting your feet up slightly higher.

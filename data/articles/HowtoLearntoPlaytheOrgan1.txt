 Before you can learn to play the organ, you must have some experience on the piano. In fact, many organ teachers will not accept you without at least one year of piano training. Begin your journey by learning about the keyboard on the piano. You must first understand what the various keys do, and which notes they can produce.


The keyboard of a piano repeats its notes from top to bottom across several octaves. This means that the notes change from low (left side) to high (right side), but don't vary in pitch.
There are twelve notes a piano can produce: seven white key notes (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) and five black key notes (C-sharp, D-sharp, F-sharp, A-flat, and B-flat).;
, Playing scales (a series of notes) is the cornerstone of mastering piano technique. Learn some basic piano scales, starting with simple two-finger scales and then advancing to three-finger scales. Practice your piano scales every day.
 As organ is considered an advanced instrument, most teachers will expect you to be able to read sheet music before you begin organ study. Learning to read music can be challenging at first, but it is a crucial skill for mastering any musical instrument, including piano and organ.


Learn about the treble clef.
Move on to the bass clef.
Learn about the parts of the note (the note head, the stem, the flag).
Learn about meter and rhythm.
 Once you have become comfortable with piano scales, and perhaps started playing some simple compositions, you must learn to use each of your hands independently. Eventually, you must be able to play two different movements (one with each hand) at the same time. This simultaneous playing must be mastered before you can advance to organ play.

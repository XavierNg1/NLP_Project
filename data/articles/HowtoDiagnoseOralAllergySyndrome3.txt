 The diagnosis of oral allergy syndrome will be made primarily on the basis of your medical history and symptoms. However, your doctor may wish to confirm a diagnosis using a variety of allergy tests.Ask your doctor: "Do you think we should test to confirm oral allergy syndrome?"

, If you think you may have oral allergy syndrome, you could ask your doctor for a skin prick test. The methods used for testing conventional food allergies do not work well for testing oral allergy syndrome. However, your doctor could do a prick-plus-prick test, which involves using fresh fruit extracts and pricking your skin to determine a reaction. If the test comes back positive, your doctor should be able to confirm the diagnosis., In addition to a skin prick test, your doctor may also conduct an oral food challenge test by having you try eating different raw fruits, vegetables or nuts and recording your reactions.If your doctor uses the oral food challenge test, you will be asked to eat small but increasing amounts of specific foods.

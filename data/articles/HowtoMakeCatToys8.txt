 Make it a decent length, at least from your outstretched hand to the floor when standing.
 Attach these at different intervals along the length of string or fishing line. Use non-toxic glue; staples risk getting caught in your cat's mouth.
 The length of this will depend on how long the feather length is.
 Dangle it in front of your cat; the cat can jump at it or chase it in circles.

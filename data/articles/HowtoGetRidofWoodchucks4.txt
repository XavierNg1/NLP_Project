 In some states, it is illegal to release trapped wildlife in an area other than where it was caught. In other states, you need a permit to trap wildlife. Check with your local fish and wildlife department or your local animal control officer to find out what the laws are in your area.


Use wire cage traps and place them at the entrance of the groundhogs burrow, or in areas where you know they travel.
Choose fresh carrots, apples or lettuce as bait.
Check the traps at least once a day. Release or euthanize trapped animals within 24 hours of capture, following local laws.

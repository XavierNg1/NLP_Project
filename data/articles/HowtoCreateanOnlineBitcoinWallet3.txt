 For those who are overly secure and protective of their finances, a hardware wallet could be for you. Hardware wallets are physical devices that hold private keys electronically and facilitate payments.These wallets can be carried on your person and don’t rely on you keeping funds in a third-party's storage.


These wallets are immune to viruses and types of Trojans that infect software wallets.
 There are many different hardware wallets that range in price range and quality. Take a look at some of the premier hardware wallets:


Pi Wallet uses cold storage and does not have wireless capabilities. It uses Armory’s client which makes it secure while not requiring you to set everything up by yourself. This is a safe and easy hardware device.
Trezor is similar to Pi, but uses a small screen to interact with. The private keys are generated by the device and can’t leave it, making it immune to malware.
USB wallets are pretty popular and more affordable devices. These devices protect your data and use similar micro-processor chips that credit cards use. These typically allow you to go between a variety of computers and your device will establish a secure connection., Most devices require an encryption code or password upon initializing. If your device doesn’t, you can always add an encryption to secure your wallet. Each hardware wallet has a different protocol for establishing a secure encryption.

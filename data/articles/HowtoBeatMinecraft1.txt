For this tutorial you will need to have at least basic knowledge of the ins and outs of Minecraft.;
, You will need to find at least 5 diamonds, 64 iron, and several stacks of coal. You will need seven diamonds if you want a sword, pickaxe and an enchantment table, and even more if you want armor.


This step could take a very long time.
 You will need at least 1 diamond sword, 1 diamond pick, 1 full set of iron armor, a bow, arrows, and several stacks of torches.

Only diamond picks can mine obsidian.
You can also use obsidian in the crafting of an enchantment table, which can help a lot when fighting the dragon or simply playing the game in general.
 Enderpearls can be gathered by killing endermen. Enderpearls have several uses so gather at least 20 of them. Some of their uses are:


Teleportation. Right click with an enderpearl selected to throw the enderpearl, and be teleported to its landing site. This can be quite useful in areas such as ravines, large caves and the Nether.
Eye of Ender ingredient. You use enderpearls to craft ender eyes.
 These are crucial in helping you locate and unlock the endgame. You can craft an Eye of Ender, by combining blaze powder and an enderpearl in the crafting grid.


This is a shapeless recipe, and the ingredients can be placed anywhere in the crafting grid.
Blaze powder is crafted by dropping a blaze rod anywhere in the crafting grid.

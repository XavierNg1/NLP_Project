 Check for software updates that are available to you in the Settings>General menu. Although not every new version of Apple's iOS software is available to all versions of the iPod Touch, this step may help you more easily follow along with the directions and keep your device running as smoothly as possible.
 This method involves deleting your browser history only and doing it directly through the Safari browser app.
 On most versions this will be in the bottom right hand corner - it resembles an open book. Continue clicking on the open book icon or on a button labeled "History" until you see a list of the websites you have recently visited., From here you have the option to delete your browser history either site by site (swipe left on a particular site address then click "Delete") or to erase your entire browser history by choosing "Clear" at the bottom of the screen., If you're choosing to erase your entire browser history, more recent version of iOS may prompt you to choose how far back you'd like to go (e.g. the last hour, Today, Today and Yesterday, All Time).


Safari may warn that you while all associated website data and cookies will be cleared from only this device, your specific browser history will be cleared across all connected iCloud devices.

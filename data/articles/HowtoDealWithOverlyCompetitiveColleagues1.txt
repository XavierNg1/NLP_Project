Avoid responding to competitive outbreaks at work with arrogance or jealousy;
As best you can, show competitive people some compassion.
 Accept that you're exceptional and wonderful just as you are. You don't need external validation to prove this, nor do you need more things to show that you're better than anyone else. Ask your co-workers exactly what it is they're wanting more of, and how they feel this is improving their personal lives.

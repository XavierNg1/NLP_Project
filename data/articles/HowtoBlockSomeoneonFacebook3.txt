 When you block someone on Facebook, they will no longer be able to see your profile or communicate with you in any way. If all you're trying to do is hide some posts from someone, you may be better off taking a less drastic method, as it will lead to less hurt feelings.


To hide posts from someone, click the âˆ¨ button at the top-right corner of the post and select "Unfollow Name". This will hide all future posts from that person but keep them as a friend. They will not be notified that you have hidden their posts.
 By default, when you post something everyone on your Friends list can see it. You can change this so that certain people are excluded.


Click the "Friends" menu at the bottom of the post you are making.
Select "More Options" and then "Custom".
In the "Don't share this with" field, enter the names of the people you want to exclude.
 You'll still be able to receive messages from them, but they won't appear in a chat window.


Click the Gear button at the bottom of the Chat window.
Select "Turn Off Chat".
Select "Turn off chat for only some friends..." and then enter in the names of the people you don't want to chat with.

Dip the toothbrush in the paste and massage the soles of your shoes. Wipe clean with a wet cloth when finished., If your canvas shoes have any stains on them, place a small amount of stain remover on the stained area of the shoe. Allow the stain remover to sit on the shoe for the time recommended on the stain remover packaging.Make sure you test the stain remover on an inconspicuous part of the shoe first. This way you can make sure the product isn’t going to fade or stain your shoes.
 Add a gentle laundry detergent to the machine, choose cold as the water temperature, and begin running the gentle or delicate cycle. When the machine is about three-quarters of the way filled with water, add the shoes and close the lid., Once the washing machine has completely finished its cycle, it’s time to remove the shoes from the machine. Place them in an area that is away from direct sun, heat, or air vents. Allow to dry overnight.

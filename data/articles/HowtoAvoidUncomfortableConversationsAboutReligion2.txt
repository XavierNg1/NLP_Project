 A little white lie is just fine if you're trying to get out of an awkward conversation about religion. Tell the person you've had fun talking to them, but you've actually got to go now.Make up an excuse where the person can't reasonably follow you.
For instance, if you say you're going to refill your drink, they might try to follow you.
Instead, say you've got to go call home and check on things.
 If someone makes an awkward or offensive remark about religion, you don't have to respond in any way at all. Simply turn and walk away. This might be considered rude, but it's reasonable if it's really not the place or time to talk religion., If someone makes a religious comment, even one that annoys you, no one says you have to respond. This is especially true if it seems like an awkward time to pick up the topic. If thereâ€™s not a question directed specifically at you, just let the comment go. Leave as soon as you can.

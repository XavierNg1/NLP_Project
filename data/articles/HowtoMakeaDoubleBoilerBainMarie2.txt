 Choose a large roasting dish or other oven-safe container with high sides. This should be large enough to hold your smaller dish (or dishes) with about 1–2 inch (2.5–5 cm) of space around the edge, to allow for water circulation.Place this dish in the oven now, as it will be difficult to transport once filled with water.


Preheat your oven according to your recipe before you begin this process.
 Ramekins and other small containers may slide against the surface of the baking dish when you pour in water. A folded towel or a silicone baking mat will help prevent this. This will also provide more insulation, but that is not typically necessary., Place the pan or ramekins that contain your dish into the large container. If you are using multiple containers, nestle them together in the center to prevent them sliding around.This method is great for custards, flans, cheesecakes and other baked desserts that contain eggs.
To prevent a skin forming on smooth custards, cover the small containers with foil., Heat water to boiling and pour it carefully into the larger pan, until it reaches ⅓ to ½ of the way up the sides of the smaller containers.Pour slowly to avoid splashing water into your food. If available, pour from a kettle or measuring cup spout.
 Follow the baking instructions for your recipe, but check on the bain marie frequently. The water should be barely simmering. If it starts to boil, reduce the oven temperature.If the water level gets low during cooking, pour in hot tap water to replenish it.
 Tongs coated in silicone or rubber make it easy to remove the hot ramekins. You can improve a pair by wrapping wide rubber bands around metal tongs, or just remove the containers carefully with pot holders.Open the oven and leave the larger container there until it's cooled enough to touch.

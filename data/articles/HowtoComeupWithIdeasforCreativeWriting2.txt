For example, if you talked your mother out of going to the grocery store after noticing ominous clouds on your way home from school, imagine how your life would have been different if your mother had gone to the store and it was demolished by the tornado.
 Go somewhere public where you can observe people coming and going, such as a shopping mall, nightclub, or auditorium. As you watch them, ask journalist questions to yourself about them. Where are they going? What are they doing? Where did they come from? Do they have a family? What do they enjoy doing? What do they hate?, Whether you call it a log, journal, or diary, recording your daily experiences with other people, places, and events gives you a written resource to draw from whenever you need story ideas.The more detail you put in your journal when writing down your experiences, the more detail you can take from them and put into your story, enhancing its believability.
 Another person's perspective may be enough to encourage you to accept the idea that's been kicking around in your head and run with it, or you can trade story ideas you can't develop for ideas your fellow writers can't develop but that you can.

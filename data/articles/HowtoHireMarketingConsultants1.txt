 Establish what you hope to achieve with the help of a marketing consultant. Some companies simply want to reach more clients, others hire a consultant to plan and execute a detailed marketing strategy.;

Talk to your professional network about marketing consultants they have used, or if they know marketing experts who might be looking for work. Word of mouth is powerful in the marketing field.
 If you have a marketing director or a team of marketing staff members, ask for their input.


Remind them that they are not being replaced. Staff might feel threatened by the use of consultants, but if they are involved in choosing and working with the consultants from the beginning, the relationship will be far more harmonious and productive.
 You can get the names of local marketing consultants by searching for them online.


Use the Internet to explore the online reputations of different consultants as well. Spend some time on their websites and reading testimonials and reviews before you select a few of them to interview.

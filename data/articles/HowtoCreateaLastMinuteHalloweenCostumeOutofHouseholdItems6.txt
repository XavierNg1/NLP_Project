 You'll need:


A black and/or purple dress
A black cardigan or cape
Broomstick/floor brush (optional)
Stick to act as a wand (optional)
Black face painting crayon or other face make-up (optional)

, If you can find a cape or shawl to go with it, that'll add to the look. Assuming you don't have a witch's hat available, you're going more for the classic "hag" look than a glamorous, decked-out witch. Layers can help you look like that wicked witch in the woods.
 Using the black face painting crayon, draw a spider on one cheek. This could just be a big circle next to a small one with four curved lines on either side of the circles.


Consider adding some warts or other blemishes, too.
 You can keep it simple with a stick from the back yard, or decorate it more in the style of a Harry Potter type wand, if you prefer.

 Plain, unsweetened yogurt is best for this. You can use any type of yogurt you want, but make sure that it is smooth, with no chunky bits of fruit in it.








You can use more yogurt to make more slime. Plan on using 1 part yogurt and 3 parts cornstarch.
 You don't have to do this, but it could make your slime look more interesting. Add in a drop or two of food coloring, then stir it in with a spoon.
 The cornstarch will cause the yogurt to thicken up and turn to slime!If you used more yogurt, you will need to use 3 times the amount of cornstarch.









If you can't find cornstarch, use cornflour instead.
 Once the ingredients start to leave the sides of the bowl, you can start kneading it by hand. Keep stirring and kneading until the ingredients come together and form a glob of slime.
 Poke it, stretch it, let it run through your fingers. Even though both ingredients are edible, it is not recommended that you gobble this up! When you are done playing with it, put it into an airtight container and store it in the fridge. Keep in mind that this slime will eventually go bad. Once it starts to smell or look funny, throw it out!

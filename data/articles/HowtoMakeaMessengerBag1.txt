 You will need three ~16” square pillowcases. These should be made of heavy upholstery fabric, in the same or matching prints or colors, and include a zipper opening.


One pillowcase will form the outside of the bag, one will form the inner lining, and the other will form the strap.;
, Cut one of the pillowcases to form the straps by cutting the edge with the zipper, as well as the edge on the opposite side. Now cut the remainder to form six 5” by 15” strips.
 From four of the six pieces, stitch their ends together so they form one long 5” wide strip.
 With right (patterned) sides facing each other, stitch the long sides together to form a tube. Use your preferred method to turn the tube right side out.
 Stitch a rectangle over the seams where you joined the pieces. Flip in the ends about 3” on each side and then edge stitch all along the entire strap.
 Pin the ends of the straps to the pillowcase you are using as the main section of the bag such that the zipper is open and at the top and the side seams align with the center of strap. The straps should be placed far enough down so that the folded in 3” section is entirely on the bag.
 Iron flat and then edge stitch a rectangle at the end of the strap to join it to the bag (this rectangle should follow the 3” folded section). Make an “x” across the rectangle to reinforce. Do this for both sides.
 Fold in and iron the edges of one of the remaining strap pieces, so that the edge looks clean when viewing the facing side. Pin it to the facing side of the lining pillowcase, in the upper half section towards the zipper. Sew along the bottom edge and sides with one seam in the middle to form two pockets.
 Trim off the zipper and iron the edges down, so that the edge is clean. Flip the pillowcase inside out and place it inside the main bag. Pin together and then sew, one side and then the other, remembering to backstitch at each of the four ends. You’re done!

 If you smoke and/or drink a lot of alcohol you are more susceptible to peptic ulcers.Alcohol reduces the mucous lining in your stomach which will increase stomach acid, while smoking increase the risk of ulcers for those with bacteria already in their stomach. Peptic ulcers were once thought to be caused by spicy food, however this is not the case.


You may also be vulnerable if you have a family history of ulcers, take aspirin regularly, or are over the age of 50., The mild symptoms of peptic ulcers include a burning pain in the stomach between meals or at night, bloating, heartburn and nausea. In extreme cases you may experience black stool, loss of weight, severe pain or vomiting blood., Peptic ulcers are caused by a bacteria in the stomach called H. pylori. If you experience any of the severe symptoms, you should visit an emergency room immediately. If your symptoms are mild and persistent you schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor. Your doctor will most likely prescribe antibiotics and/or acid reducers to treat the ulcers.

  Your friend should be a pretty good judge of character and know if he's already dating someone. From there you can ask them to set up a hangout for all of you. This way your attempt to meet him won't be obvious or creepy.
 If you feel daring, send him a message along with a friend request saying "Hey, just thought I'd say hi as I notice we have a lot of mutual friends.", Or send him a message a week later asking if he'd like to hang out or join in on some gathering with your friends. Throw tons of eye contact or look at him when he seems unaware of you doing that. That should tickle his interest., If you're at a hangout with lots of friends, sit next to him and try to have a one-on-one conversation. Otherwise, show your interest by asking if you can buy him a drink or make him one if you're at a house party. Ask him how you know your friends to ease him into conversation about what he does and things he likes., Send him a two-liner saying it was great to see him and ask if he would like to get coffee or lunch sometime. Keep it casual. If rapport between the two of you is already flirtatious, you can set the tone by saying "Great! It's a date ;)"

, If he's a mature and caring person, he would directly tell you he's not interested. If he doesn't ever respond, assume it's a "no". It's inconsiderate of someone to avoid responding to questions they are afraid to answer, and you shouldn't waste any time waiting on his interest. Commend yourself yourself for taking the leap!

On the other hand, if he says he's "busy" or "maybe" without an explanation, take it as a cue that he's letting you off nicely. The ball is in his court, after all. He'll reach out if he wants to hang out some other time. Remember, a rejection would be much better than an insincere date!

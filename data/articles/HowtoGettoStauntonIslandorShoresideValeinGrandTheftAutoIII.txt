 Next, you need to find a fast car.


If you want to hijack a police without getting caught, walk up to the passenger side, and attempt to enter the vehicle (or just take one f the cars outside of police station). Wait for the cop to get out and close his door, then you can get in and drive away. Other vehicles that are fast enough include the Banshee, Ambulance,mafia sentinel, Fire Truck.






Go to Callaghan Bridge. If you have not yet unlocked Staunton Island, slowly drive through one of the gaps in the barrier, then drive across the bridge as fast as you can - you'll barely make it to the other side if your car is fast enough. If you have unlocked Staunton Island, drive across normally.






Now to get to Shoreside Vale. Go to the northernmost docks, on the East side of Staunton Island, and hijack the speedboat. Head north towards Rockford.






When you reach the barrier, keep heading North for a while, then turn around. There's a nearly unnoticeable slope in the inside corner between the military base and the rest of Staunton Island. Head for it as fast as you can. If done properly, the boat will fly onto land.






Unlike other vehicles, boats do not blow up when flipped upside down, so don't worry if the boat flipped. What you need to do now is hijack a really big vehicle like a Bus or a Yankee. Do not go far from the boat or it will disappear.






Drive towards the boat in your large vehicle. You may want to kill the previous occupant so he or she doesn't get in your way. Slowly push the boat around the West side of the military base.






When the boat is close to the water, exit your vehicle. Push the boat on foot by sprinting at it. Be careful, you don't want it to fall in yet.






When the boat is about to fall into the water, enter it. If done properly, the boat will slide into the water with you in it.






Take the boat to somewhere on Shoreside Vale that you can get onto from the boat.

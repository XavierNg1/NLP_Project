 Castile soap is an olive oil-based soap. There are both liquid body washes as well as hard soap bars. Some are even scented with essential oils. Pour or rub the soap on a damp wash cloth. Lather it over your body, and rinse completely., Salt granules are larger than sugar, and they are better suited for tougher parts of your body. Use a coarse sea salt or Himalayan pink salt. Combine one cup of salt with half a cup of almond, grapeseed, or avocado oil. With clean fingers, massage the scrub over damp skin. You can add a few drops of essential oil to give it a fragrance.
You should exfoliate your body one to three times a week.
 If you do not want to use a scrub, you can exfoliate your body with gloves. Lather the gloves up with a natural body wash, such as castile soap, and work the soap over your body. Rinse off completely afterwards. Do not use the gloves on your face.


Rinse the gloves and hang them to dry afterwards. You can use the gloves repeatedly.
 Add half a cup of baking soda to a warm bath. Baking soda is a natural deodorant, and it can help exfoliate your skin.Do not do this more than once a month.

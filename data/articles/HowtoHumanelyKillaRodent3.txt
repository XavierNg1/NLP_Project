 Spring (or snap) traps are still considered to be the more humane of the various traps you can get. Much more so than a glue trap, for example. Spring traps still cause pain to rodents caught in them, but they should kill the rodent very quickly. When designed and set-up when these traps make a quick death more likely., To set-up a trap like this, place bait within the specified area, ensuring that the rest of the trap is clean. Doing this will make it more likely that, when tripped, the trap will close fully and the rodent will be killed rather than injured. Then, place the trap at right angles to a wall with the bait nearest the wall.The rodent should have a clear path to the trap.
The bait should be changed regularly.
 You should check the traps every morning, and be prepared to dispose of any dead rodents straight-away. Carefully remove them from the trap, place in a plastic bag, and then place that bag in a second bag, and throw it away into a secured bin. Always use gloves when you are doing this, and you can use a household disinfectant to clean the trap.If you find a rodent, injured but alive, you should kill it as quickly and humanely as possible.

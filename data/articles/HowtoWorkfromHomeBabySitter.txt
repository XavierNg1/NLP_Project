 You can post these at an elementary school, YMCA or even a church in your area. Make sure you write your phone number and address on your poster and to make several copies.;

This works better if you have a child of your own. This will help because if neighbors know that you have a child they will be more comfortable leaving their kid with you as well.
 By then people will have seen your poster and will start calling. (Once they call tell them what time you start babysitting, when pick-up time is and ask if their child has any food allergies or medical problems.)

,, Take this time to set-up and eat breakfast in case you don't have time after. Once the children arrive greet them and their parents. (If you want to give the kids a name tag that they can write their name on so you remember) Once parents leave you can offer the child breakfast if they have not eaten already; keep the food allergies in mind, buy snacks and food that are peanut free.
 You can even offer to play or teach them a game.
 Then give them a choice for lunch, e.g. pizza or a tuna sandwich (It helps if they can all agree on one food). Remember to keep their food allergies in mind before you ask.
 If you want let the children continue playing or take them to the park or on a walk so they can run around. Once home again you can let them have nap time or do something else until their parents come to pick-up.
 By now the children should be picked up. If the parent has to work late offer to walk their child home or keep then with you until parents arrive. (It helps to ask in the morning if the parents will be late to pick up the child at the end of the day).
 Now you can clean up, enjoy your night and get ready for the next day.

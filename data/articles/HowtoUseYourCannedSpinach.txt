 Warmed-up canned spinach has a wonderfully simple, refreshing taste that is complemented well with one to two tablespoons of lemon juice or red wine vinegar per can and a sprinkling of bacon (or bacon bits, for the less culinarily-inclined). Top with a little melted butter if you would like.;
, Canned spinach on its own is quite yummy, but can easily be enhanced using basic spices and toppings. Popular toppings include garlic powder, dry mustard, chopped tomatoes, olives, feta cheese, crushed red pepper, and bacon bits.
 Canned spinach can very easily be blended into tomato sauce, or spread across lasagna sheets as a filling. Well complemented with tomatoes, basil, and ricotta, canned spinach can pretty much be incorporated into any tomato-and-pasta recipe.
 Although it is little more decadent than your standard heart-healthy dish, it is still highly nutritious. Sauté a chopped onion with two tablespoons of butter until browned, then add spinach and cook through.
 Add ½-1 can of canned spinach per pound of meat and mix with bread crumbs, veggies, and whatever other ingredients you usually add. This makes for a fantastically easy way to get the children to eat their leafy greens.
 Use one can to every four to five eggs and add some garlic or parmesan cheese if preferred. Season simply with salt and pepper and your eggs are now much more vitamin-rich!

, Mix a can of spinach with three beaten eggs, some chopped onion, a cup of milk, some chopped bacon, and a few slices of provolone cheese and pour into pie shell and bake at 400 °F (204 °C) for 30-40 minutes.

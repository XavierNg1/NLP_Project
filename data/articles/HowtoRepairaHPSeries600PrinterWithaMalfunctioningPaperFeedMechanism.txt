 One way that you can do this is to take all the covers off the printer. Then take apart the print head assembly and associated parts until you are down to the top hold down rail that holds down the paper pick-up assembly and where the clutch actuator is located. Once that is done, take the broken part and using EXTRA STRENGTH Krazy Glue glue the broken pieces back together.
 You then place the clutch actuator back into it's area and reassembled the rest of the printer.

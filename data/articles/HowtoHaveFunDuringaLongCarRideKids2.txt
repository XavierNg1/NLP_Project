 Share stories, remember funny events or memories, or discuss what you're going to do when you arrive at your destination. It will be nice to chat to family on phone so you can catch up what you missed.
 Some great ones are I Spy, naming things you see that starts with each letter of the alphabet, making acronyms for license plates, playing hangman if you have some paper and a pencil or pen. Or anything else you can think of!

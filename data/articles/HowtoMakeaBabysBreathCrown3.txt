 In order to make a baby’s breath crown using the stem of the flowers as the base, you need to choose a bunch of baby’s breath that has a long stem. The stem should be long enough to wrap around your head and fit like a crown., Cut off all of the smaller bunches of baby’s breath that shoot off of the main stem. You can either cut them with scissors or just twist them off using your hands. Set these small bunches aside because they will eventually be attached to the crown., Directly under the small bunch of baby’s breath at the end of the stalk, tape another small bunch of baby’s breath to the stalk. Continue to tape small bunches of baby’s breath to the stalk until it is long enough to fit as a crown.Be sure to tuck in the stems with tape, so that you do not have any stems sticking out of the crown.
 Once you have reached the end of the stalk, carefully bend it into a circle to create the shape of the crown. Use floral tape to attach the two ends together.You can then fill in any gaps with more baby’s breath. Simply attach small bunches using the floral tape.
You can also wrap a ribbon around the crown in order to make the base more stable.

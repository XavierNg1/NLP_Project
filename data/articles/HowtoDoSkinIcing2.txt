 Clean the sink thoroughly first. Then stop up the sink drain. Fill the sink basin with tap water and add several ice cubes. There should be more water than ice in the sink or bowl.If you prefer, you can use a large bowl such as a punch bowl wherein you can fully submerge your face.
Add some slices of and cucumber or chunks of watermelon if desired., Hold your breath and dip your face into the ice water for ten to thirty seconds.Do this several times, with a few seconds to a few minutes in between.The feeling of this process is intense, and has a temporary side effect of discomfort or pain due to the sudden temperature change. If it doesn’t feel at all intense, you may want to add a bit more ice.
Other than temporary discomfort, icing your face shouldn’t cause any negative side effects, as some skin products can.Don’t do this for longer than fifteen minutes.
 After facial skin icing, apply skin products if desired. For instance, moisturizer, toner or acne treatment (if needed).If your skin tends to get dry, go with a moisturizer. If your skin is on the oily side, use toner, an astringent which removes the film of oil leftover from cleansers.Saturate cotton pads with skin product and apply it to your face and neck.

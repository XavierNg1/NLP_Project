 A cell phone will always include a SIM tray to house the SIM card. It is where your cell data is stored, and it enables people to contact you through your selected network provider.


Locate the SIM tray. If you’re having difficulty identifying it, see your phone’s manual. It should look like a slot exactly the size of your SIM card and features golden terminals where the SIM data is read.
Insert your SIM card carefully.;
, Hold the Power button to boot up the phone.


Newly bought cell phones will typically be somewhere around the 50% battery charge, so you don’t have to worry about charging your phone yet.
 Enter the contacts manager on your phone and add new contacts that you will be communicating with on your phone.
 If your phone is Wi-Fi capable, you will be able to receive and send e-mails through your phone. Set your e-mail up with your phone’s e-mail app.
 Personalizing settings, like wallpaper, ringtones, alarms, and that sort of thing, can be done last. This usually takes the most time as you will be figuring out which sounds and wallpapers work for you.

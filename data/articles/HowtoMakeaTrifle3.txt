 Your ice bath is meant to instantly stop the custard from cooking, removing the heat much faster than if you just let the pot sit and cool., Separate the egg yolks from the egg whites and then rough them up with a fork, as if you were scrambling them., Use a tall, heavy-bottomed saucepot to prevent burning. Keep stirring until you've completely dissolved the sugar and cornstarch.If you want to use a fresh vanilla bean, cut the pod lengthwise and scoop out the seeds, adding them to the mixture now along with the vanilla husk.
 Stir occasionally, letting the milk scald. You'll see bubbles around the edges of the pot. Once it happens, keep stirring for another 20-30 seconds before removing from the heat., This "tempers" the eggs, which is the process of getting them slowly up to heat so that they don't accidentally cook., This should only take 2-3 minutes, and the custard should coat the back of your stirring spoon, not drip right off, when it is ready.

If you want to use a flavored extract, like vanilla, add it in now!, Make sure, of course, that water cannot get into the custard. Then simply cover it with a towel or cheesecloth and let it cool down to room temperature.

For an even smoother custard, run it through a fine-mesh strainer before pouring into the chilling bowl., If you want something a bit more flavorful for your trifle, consider mixing in the following ingredients to mix things up:


Chocolate syrup or cocoa powder.
4-5 tablespoons of lemon curd
Orange zest and orange extract
1-2 teaspoons instant coffee
Flavored liquor, such as raspberry or chocolate

, This allows the custard to set and cool off, which is far more preferable in a trifle. It will keep for about a week in the fridge..

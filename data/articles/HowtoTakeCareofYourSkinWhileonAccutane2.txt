 Wax epilations (waxing) should be avoided for at least six months after completing your Isotretinoin treatment.
 During the treatment period, your skin is thinner than usual and leaves you more vulnerable to scarring.
 If you must remove facial or leg hair, use a safety razor and a mild shaving cream. If your skin is especially cracked or dry, use the suds of a mild soap or non-soap cleanser instead of shaving cream. Wet the area of the skin you wish to shave, then apply the lather or suds to it. Move your razor slowly across the surface of the area you wish to shave. Wash your razor and rinse your shaved body part when finished.


Take care when shaving. Do not use straight edge razors.
Using an electric shaver is the least damaging way to remove leg and facial hair.

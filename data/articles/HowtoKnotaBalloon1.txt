Your grip should be firm, but not so firm as to burst the balloon.
The neck of the balloon, which is the end of the balloon adjacent to the mouth through which you blow air, should be facing away from you.
 Use your dominant hand, with the palm facing to the floor, to grip the neck of the balloon between your first and second fingers and your thumb.
 Use the first 2 fingers of your other hand to carefully stretch out the neck of the balloon.
 Pull the neck of the balloon up and around the fingers of your non-dominant hand until it meets the body of the balloon again.


While you do this, rotate your non-dominant hand counter-clockwise until the palm faces upwards. The neck of the balloon should now form a loop around the first two fingers of your non-dominant hand.
 With your dominant hand, push the neck of the balloon gently through the center of the loop you just created.
 Withdraw the first 2 fingers of your non-dominant hand from the loop when the neck is passed all the way through. Pull the end of the neck tight so the knot doesn't come loose. plus ask a parent to tie a balloon.

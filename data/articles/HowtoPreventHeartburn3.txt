 Milk of Magnesia can combat acidity in your stomach because it has a very basic pH. Magnesium is a mineral that helps with the function of your body’s muscles and nerves. It can also help to increase the amount of water or basic fluid in your stomach, thereby diluting your gastric acid.


Try taking 5 to 15 milliliters (0.17 to 0.51  fl oz) of Milk of Magnesia. You can take this supplemental medication one to four times a day, depending on the intensity of your gastric acid.You can also take Milk of Magnesia in tablet form.

 Most items in the game should prevent you from ever having to put mana in. Also, if you have the expansion, collect +mana charms.;
, This varies hugely amongst different players, depending on their current equipment and their requirements of str to wear the gear they saved for their character.
 Dexterity is also VERY important for your blocking with shields. Go to your character screen and check your chance to block, to ensure you're not lacking in dexterity.
 Don't waste your time trying to get 75%(max) blocking on a shield that only has 30 percent chance to block. Be careful on that.
 Once you're happy with your other stats, ALWAYS dump the rest into vitality. The difference between progress and failure is a huge factor with vitality. The more you have, the more you can take. Don't even try Hell Mode unless you have at least 1000 life.
 Always look for items that gives you resistances, save every small charm that gives more than +5 of any resistance.
, Most skills in your skill tree have synergies. Synergies are other skills that compliment and improve the other skill. For example. i want to be an ice sorcerer. So If i put 20 points in ice bolt, my damage for blizzard is 20x15+ damage on level 1! Study your skill tree for your character. And plan what synergies are important for the main skills you want to use later.

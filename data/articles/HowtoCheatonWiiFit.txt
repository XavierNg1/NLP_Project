 Whether you are doing the island lap or the multi-player run this will sure come in handy.


When it tells you to run, move your left foot side to side. This will make you go faster.
Or instead of running just shake the Wii remote up and down repeatedly.;
, This will show you an easier way to win on the tightrope walking game on the Wii.


Instead of walking normally like it instructs, swing your feet out to the side, this will make your trip across the tightrope a little smoother.
 One exercise where you have to lean your body left and right with your hands above your head. This will tell you how to stay in the circle without actually moving.
 Keep it like that the whole time and stay still.

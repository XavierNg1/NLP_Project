This will be the baby’s torso.
Make sure that you are using a pencil for the draft sketch so you can erase it afterwards to make it neat.;
,


Draw an elongated oval that overlaps a bit on the top side of the square
This will be the baby’s head

,


Add two long ovals at each side of the square, it should touch the bigger oval as well. This would be the baby’s shoulder and arms.
(Optional) Draw a vertical line starting from the top of the big oval down to the lower tip of the oval.



Add another oval at each set of limb.
This will be your baby’s arm (elbow to wrist).
Make it round since baby’s arms and legs are very chubby and round.



to add the hands, place two circles at the end of the wrist. It doesn’t need to be perfect circles just as long as you can recognize it as hands.
Draw a long horizontal rectangle across the head. At the end of each side, draw a half circle for the ears.



For the eyes, draw 2 half circles right above the upper side of the rectangle.
Just below the eyes (in the middle of the rectangle), draw a short squiggly line for the nose.
For the mouth, add a semi-heart shaped upside down triangle at the bottom end side of the rectangle.



Put in mind the overlapping lines and parts that should be hidden.
The line art might not look perfect and crisp but it should look neat when the pencil is erased.



You can add details like the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, hair and the lines around the body to show off the baby’s fats.



You may want to add some pink tints on the baby’s cheeks for added bloom.

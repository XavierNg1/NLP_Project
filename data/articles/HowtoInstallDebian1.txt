 Installing Debian on your machine will clear your entire hard drive and reformat it, erasing all data in the process. Store your important information on a removable drive before beginning the installation.;
, Debian is distributed through www.debian.org, and the necessary files can be found on the "Getting Debian" page.
 From the Debian website, choose the installation image that is suited for your processor architecture. If you don't know what type of processor your machine has, choose the "32-bit PC netinst iso" image, as this one is compatible with common 32-bit Intel or AMD processors.
 Once you have downloaded the image file (it will have a ".iso" extension), burn it to a disc using disk imaging software. There are several free applications available that can perform this task, though your computer must have a CD-R or DVD-R drive. Alternatively, you could burn the image to a USB drive if your computer supports booting from a USB drive.
 Once you mount the .iso file onto a disc, leave the disc in your optical drive and restart the computer. The computer will boot from the disc and take you directly to the Debian installation wizard.
 Debian includes an option that lets you run the operating system completely from the CD or DVD, without overwriting any information on your hard drive (this option is called Debian Live). Choose this option from the installation wizard if you want to test Debian before installing it completely. Note that performance will be quite slow with this option.
 When you are ready to proceed with the full installation, follow the prompts in the installation wizard to set up the operating system as desired. You will be given the option to partition your hard drive in case you want to run Debian alongside another operating system such as Microsoft Windows.

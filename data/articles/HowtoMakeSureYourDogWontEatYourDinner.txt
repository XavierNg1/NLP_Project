 If you haven't established your control, you will have a lot more problems than just losing your dinner.;
, Even scraps. And do not allow friends, other family members, or guests to feed the dog from or under the table. This will begin a negative habit, one which the dog will not understand why he is not entitled to your food and also leads to begging.
 If you crate your dog, before serving your food, put the dog into his crate. If you don't crate your dog, place the dog into a tie down position. If you don't use a tie down, place the dog outside, on their dog bed, or in another room.
 If the dog begins to release himself from the down position, use a steady voice to remind him he is in a down. Do not allow the dog release himself from your last command.
 In other words if you are consistent with your dog, and work with them daily, they will be responsive. Don't think just because your dog is trained, your work is done. In the wild, the Alpha dog is constantly being challenged so you need to work with your dog maintaining your dominance. Also a dog who is working is a dog who is not bored. A bored dog tends to engage in negative behavior, in part because you pay attention to the dog during that time period

 You can get these pretty much anywhere, eBay do them for 50p, Amazon do them for 99p with free P&P. Micro-fibre cloths can be found pretty much anywhere that has anything to do with technology.;
, You can do this using your finger, so dust can just be swept off using your finger, grub (texting while eating chocolate perhaps?) can also be removed with some LIGHT scratching on the area it's in.
 Just run it under a cold tap for literally a couple of seconds. You might find the water runs off, just wet it a little more and wring out as much as you can. Make sure the cloth is only very slightly wet as you could damage your precious Apple device.
 Do this for about 20-30 seconds. When you remove the cloth, you'll realise that there may be water marks on the screen, this is where the next step comes in.
 Rub the screen in the same way as you did previously.
 Now, you'll have a screen that looks as good as new! This technique works just as well for the back of your iPhone, iPad or iPod.

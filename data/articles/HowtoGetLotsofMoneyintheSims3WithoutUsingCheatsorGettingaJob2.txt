 If you can, buy an expensive one so that it is less likely to break.
 You will likely get to choose which genre you write. Choose whatever genre you want, but try to select a genre that will open up a new writing genre. For example, if you write a few Trashy genre books, and you are a Hopeless Romantic Sim, then you will get to write the Romance genre.
 If it is good enough to be published, you may see it on the library or bookstore's bookshelves!

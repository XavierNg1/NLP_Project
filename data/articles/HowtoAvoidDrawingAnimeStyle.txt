 If so, try telling the person that what you draw isn't always anime, then show them an anime drawing and a non-anime drawing and point out the differences.;
, Is your work any of these things?

, They're expressive, which is useful in all cartoons.
 Just watch people reacting with their natural habitat. Make notes of how their face is shaped and how their hair has grown. Draw quick sketches if it helps.
 The person you looked at had a square chin? Draw that. Were they ageing and wrinkly? Draw that. If you are drawing a cartoon then make it less lifelike.
 You can take two paths: (in my opinion)look at your subjects nose and just draw it simplified or just get rid of the nose all together. Some cartoonists draw eyes without pupils, some have no ears!

, If you just want cartoon-like clothes, try to stop drawing so many creases and folds. If you want realism, add more.

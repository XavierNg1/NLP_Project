 Teachers do not always give you the questions or clues to what is on the test. Pay attention in class and review your notes. Most likely, a test will be over recently covered information. The teacher will most likely give you some info but if not then just read your current text chapters, notes, and correct homework. Look at any mistakes you made and correct them now.;

If not, then try anyway, it's normal for beginning French students to struggle with this, but an advanced student should be able to do this with little difficulty. It' also okay if you don't understand every little word. As long as you understand the "meat" of the question, you should know what it's asking and how to appropriately answer the question.

 If you just memorize the notes, you will tend to forget it because of stress and nerves on the day of the test. This is normal... but if you understand the question and answer there is a better chance of success when you are under stress. Making flashcards is a GREAT way of remembering information as well! Try an online website like Quizlet where the word is not only presented but also spoken. Listening to the words and having to spell them out makes remembering a lot easier!

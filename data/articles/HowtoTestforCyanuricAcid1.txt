 Every state has different laws and different levels they allow, from 30 ppm as the maximum to 100 ppm as the maximum. It’s essential you know what you are testing for, depending on your location.;
, In the right amounts, cyanuric acid protects the chlorine in a pool from ultraviolet sunlight, thereby reducing the amount of chlorine lost over time. As a result, the pool stays disinfected longer and more effectively. In high amounts, however, cyanuric acid can reduce the effectiveness of chlorine as a disinfectant. Bacteria can build up in the water when this happens and create a health risk., Many pool owners unknowingly add cyanuric acid to their pools because of the kind of chlorine they are adding. When buying chlorine for your pool, choose sodium dichloro-s-triazinetrione (“dichlor”) or trichloro-s-triazinetrione (“trichlor”).
 Once a week, set a time that you check for cyanuric acid levels. If you have concerns that your cyanuric acid levels aren’t under control, test more often.

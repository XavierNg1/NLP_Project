 This method can cool a red wine to serving temperature in two minutes, and even a light-bodied, low-alcohol white wine can be properly chilled in five to ten minutes.
 If you are using a wine bucket, fill it about ⅔ full of ice. For a larger bucket, fill it to approximately ⅔ the height of the wine bottle.
 Pour the coldest water you have access to into the bucket, until it is level with the ice.
 Salt lowers the freezing temperature of water, allowing the ice to cool the water a lower temperature than it would normally be able to. This in turn chills the wine bottle more quickly.


Smaller grains of salt tend to be more effective. Rock salt will work, but may have a less noticeable effect.
 Lower the wine bottle upright into the water. This should cause the ice water to rise above the shoulder of the wine bottle.
 Spin the neck of the bottle with your hands while waiting for the wine to chill. The movement will cause the wine inside to move around in the bottle, so more of the warm wine comes into contact with the chilled bottle, speeding up the process slightly.
 Remove the bottle when it reaches your preferred temperature, or after approximately 2 minutes for red and 7 minutes for white wine. Remove the bottle and dry it with a cloth or paper towel. Serve immediately.

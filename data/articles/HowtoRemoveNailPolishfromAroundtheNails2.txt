 Using the nail polish of your choice, apply your basecoat, color, and topcoat. Two layers of your color typically works best. Check the bottle to see how many coats are recommended.
 You must let them completely dry before trying to remove any nail polish that happened to get onto your fingers. If you don’t you’ll smudge the color on your nails.
 Fill a sink with warm, soapy water. Use a moisturizing soap for an added bonus for your hands. Once you’ve let your nails completely dry, dip your fingers into the sink. Let your nails soak for 2-3 minutes. Feel free to swish them around or simply leave them still.If you polish is water based, letting them soak for 5 or more minutes will peel the color off of your nails.
If you don’t have time to soak your nails, this can easily be done in your shower.
 Use a facecloth or your other hand to gently scrub the polish off of your skin. If it’s not coming off easily, try soaking your fingers for another minute and try again. Once you’ve successfully removed all of the polish from around your nails, dry your hands properly. Add another layer of top coat for some extra shine if desired.

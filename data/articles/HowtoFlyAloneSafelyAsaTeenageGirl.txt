 When you are a young girl traveling alone in a big airport, you may seem vulnerable, which makes you an easy target. Walk with intention, and don't act timid or afraid. Figure out how to carry all your bags, read signs in the airport and make sure you know where you're going, and ask for help directly when you need it.;
, A pair of jeans (nothing really form fitting), converse or sneakers, a nice tee shirt, and a sweater or sweatshirt is great. Avoid high heels, short skirts and shorts, really form fitting pants, and don't show any cleavage. Keep your hair neat. The objective is to avoid drawing any unnecessary attention to yourself.
 You should still let the flight attendant on your plane know that you are under 18 and flying alone. They will check up on you and make sure everything's going okay.
 However, this is often not possible. Try to avoid conversations with the people next to you. Put your headphones in as soon as it's permitted and don't take them out. It's okay to exchange a hello and a few words of casual conversation, but if the person next to you starts revealing or asking about personal information, be assertive. Excuse yourself from any conversation politely by reading a book or watching a movie from in-flight entertainment.
 Don't ever let any stranger carry your bags, or anything like that. When your flight is over, get your bags efficiently and locate whoever is going to pick you up.

 This will impact how often you need to stop, as well as how much space you need to make for the dog. Make sure that the dog is comfortable during the ride and has sufficient opportunities to relax outside of the car during the journey.


Keep your dog on a leash when outside of the car. Since driving involves being on or near the road when taking the dog on a walk during a stop, it is important to keep a leash on to avoid the dog being injured by any motorists. This will also prevent your dog from bolting off if something unfamiliar scares him suddenly.
 Whenever driving with your dog, it is important that the dog has proper identification in case it gets lost. Unlike your neighborhood, your dog won't know how to find his way home and you won't have neighbors who know the dog.

 In the lotus pose, your legs are crossed with both of your feet resting on top of your legs. This is a difficult position, so you may need to build up to it over the course of days, weeks, or months. Once you can do this, you can do this, try it without using your hands., Use your hands to bring your right foot, then your left foot, up to your chest. Practice until you can do it without feeling anything., Bring your feet higher and higher each day until you can bring them behind your head. You may need to put one leg behind your head, to start.

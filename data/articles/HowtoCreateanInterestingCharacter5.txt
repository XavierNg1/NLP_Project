 Pick two or three everyday objects and merge the names. EX: Line and Jacket = Lincet

, Pick any random object that you can think of and mess the letters around to create a last name.


Book = Kobo
Student = Tentdus

, The last resort is to use a last name generator. But, don't use it too often because they reuse a lot of the names over and over again and you don't want to seem like a copier.


When creating a backstory for your character, it is best to make it realistic. Don't go too far-fetched because that would be silly.

 If you can't or don't want to buy a new scooter, don't worry, India has one of the largest used scooter markets in the world. Talk to used scooter dealers, mechanics, and other reputable resellers, and avoid local or sketchy sellers who might try to scam you. Also check out online dealers or advertisements on sites such as OLX and quicker, but always be extra careful about buying online.
 Do not buy a scooter that is more than 5 years old or has run for more than 15,000 kilometers (9,300Â mi) per year. Also do not buy a scooter that is highly modified. Choose one that has easy availability of spare parts in the market, so that you will be prepared if anything goes wrong. Check the service records for any accidents and periodical services, and make sure you've examined any potential problems. Have a mechanic you trust check out the scooter to make sure everything looks good.


If you're buying a scooter online or from an ad, make sure you have a chance to examine the scooter in person before finalizing the purchase.
 Buy your used scooter without any loan, since the interest rates for a used scooter will be high. Make sure the previous owner has cleared the scooter of all debts and financing, otherwise it might get you into trouble.
 Pay with a cheque rather than cash if possible, since this way you'll have the record of payment. Get a receipt from the previous owner for the payment made, and have the previous owner sign it. Immediately begin the process of changing the scooter to your name by contacting your Road Transport Officer.

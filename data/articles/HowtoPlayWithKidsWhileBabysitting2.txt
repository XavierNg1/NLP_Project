 Maybe together you can find something fun to do.;
, This might speed up the process of finding the right toy to play with and even if it doesn't, it will at least kill a bit of time and keep the child from being bored for a little while. You might find that the child will want you to play too, but don't be offended or surprised if they find the toy they need and forget you're there entirely.
 No parent likes to come home to a mess, and if you don't clean up, they will probably think that you aren't responsible. To make the process of cleaning up more fun, make a game out of picking up the toys.

 Dump the rice from its container into a saucepan. Any size pan is fine, though it should comfortably hold the rice without you needing to press it down for it to all fit.
 The amount of water will depend on the amount of rice, though a couple tablespoons should be enough for a single serving. Since the pan is on the stovetop rather than inside the microwave or oven, you can also add small amounts of water throughout the heating process if it's still looking too dry., Pour a splash of olive oil or drop a small amount of butter (less than a tablespoon) into the pan on top of the rice. This will restore more of the moisture and flavor that was lost in the fridge, and it will keep the rice from sticking to your pan., Use a fork to press down on the larger chunks of rice that may not heat as evenly when they’re stuck together. This will also help to stir and combine the rice with the water and oil., If you have the lid that came with the pan, place that on top to create a good seal to lock in the steam. If you don’t have a perfect match, use a larger lid to place on top of the pan so that all edges are still covered.
 The amount of time will vary depending on the amount of rice in the pan, but about 3-5 minutes should be enough for a single serving. Stir often to keep the rice from burning. You will know it's done when all the water has evaporated and the rice is steaming and fluffy again.

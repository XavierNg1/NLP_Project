 For mine, the NAPA auto part filter number was #4816 (approx $20.50). It's a rectangular filter, not unlike the standard air filters you replace regularly. The difference is that this one is a bit thinner/smaller, and has plastic "posts" or "stand offs" molded into it.
 In plain English, this is the plastic piece just below where your window wipers sit when they are at rest. There are two "cowls" One on the driver side, one on the passenger side. You will be removing the passenger side only., Face your front windshield and look for a series of small, round, plastic caps just beneath where the wipers are at rest. You will remove the first four only - counting from the passenger side toward the center., Remove each of the four screws with a medium sized Phillips screwdriver., Locate the "under hood" portion of the cowl you are working with. Facing the engine from the front of the car, it will be all the way in the back, on the left side., They are set in what appear to be plastic washers of the same color. These plastic washers have squeezable bottoms so they are able to be popped in and out quite easily., This may require you to push on the bottom of the screw to make it lift., As the bottom portion is squeezed together, you will be able to push the entire washer, and screw, up through the hole. Keep the washer/screw sets in a safe place., It may be a little sticky. Note: It will still be on the car. You are just moving it out of your way., This is a water guard that covers the cabin air filter. Pull the handle and it will give way., Install it "posts" side up. (The plastic stand offs point upward)., Each of the three hooks will line up the same way they did before.,,,,,

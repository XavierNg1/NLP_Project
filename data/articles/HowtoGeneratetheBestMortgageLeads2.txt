 Join PTA, clubs, committees, church groups, etc. When you’re in an organization you are more likely to meet new leads.
 Locate real estate agents in your area. Check realtor ads, websites, and the phone book. Call these realtors or go directly to their office. Let them know what you have to offer their customers. Getting a relationship with a realtor can be difficult, but a good relationship can lead to a constant stream of mortgage leads. Be persistent.
 Go to open houses in the area. The people at these open houses are interested in purchasing a home. Hand them your card, and offer your services. This is a great way to develop leads. If you have a relationship with a realtor, going to open houses could be beneficial for both of you. They talk the person into buying the home, and you’re there to close the deal immediately.
 People who are selling their homes on their own, could also benefit from knowing a mortgage professional. Let them know that you’d love to help them get their house sold. When they find someone who is interested ask that they refer them to you. Some owners who are trying to sell, might even let you put a sign in their yard.

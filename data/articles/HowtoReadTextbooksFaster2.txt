 You can do this by asking yourself pre-reading questions such as, “What is the author’s main idea?” “What does my teacher want me to focus on in this chapter?” “What have I already learned or not learned about this topic?”These questions will help you focus on important and relevant content that will enhance your leaning while excluding information that is irrelevant or that you already understand.
 In addition to highlighting, write questions and comments in the margins of your textbook or on a sheet of paper if the book does not belong to you. This will help you engage with the material and retain the information better, and thus prevent you from having to read the section over again.Make diagrams, flow charts, and outlines of the material when you can.
Make sure to focus on and define terms that you are unfamiliar with.
 Write down the main points on a sheet of paper. Use examples to clarify the main points. If you are not able to summarize key information, then you may need to go over relevant sections once more.Limit your summary to one page.
 Pick a quiet space in your house, for example your room, or the library to read. Put away other sources of distraction like your phone, computer, and the Internet. Instead, read the chapter and write your notes by hand, and silence your phone or turn it off.Additionally, make sure the the space you choose is well-lit and comfortable, but not too comfortable.
If you choose to study at home, let your family (or roommates) know that you will be studying quietly in your room and that you would appreciate it if they kept the noise level down.

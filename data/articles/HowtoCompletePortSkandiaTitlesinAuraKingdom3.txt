 Roy is a delivery man found near the Helonia Coast portal. Offer him your help to start the quest. Roy will give you a Wine Cask.
 You can't find the Merchant's name in the auto-navigation using the Map. You can find him near the Traveling Priest, or simply enter the town through it's entrance then look to your right.


After giving the Wine Cask to Vincent, he will ask you to deliver the wine to Captain Brook.
 Captain Brook's location is not available in the auto-navigation. To find him, just go to Skandia portâ€”he will be standing near the stairs, a few steps away from the Anglers Anonymous Merchant.
 Give him the wine, and you will be rewarded with a title Wine Keeper, which gives you +2 Evasion bonus.

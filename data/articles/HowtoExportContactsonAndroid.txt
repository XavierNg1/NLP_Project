 On Androids with the default (Google) contacts app, the app has a blue icon with a white outline of a person. Other Contacts apps may look different, but they should all be called “Contacts.”;
, Look for a ⁝ or ⋯ at the top-right corner of the contacts list.On older devices, you may need to tap the multitask button near the home key to bring up the menu.
 If you don’t see this option, skip to the next step.
, You can either export your contacts to your SIM card or to the storage on your device. Choose the option that works best for you.


If your contacts are stored in multiple places (such as in a Google account and a SIM card), you may be prompted to select a contact source. Tap the source from which you want to export contacts, or select All Contacts.
If you’d prefer to your contacts file with a specific person, select Share name card via or Share visible contacts instead, then select the app with which you want to share the file.
 Your contacts will now export to the location or app you selected. This process may take several minutes if you have a lot of contacts.

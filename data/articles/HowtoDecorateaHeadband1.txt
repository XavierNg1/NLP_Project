 Take a six inch length of ribbon and overlap the two ends by about half an inch so the ribbon forms a loop.;
, Press down on the center of the ribbon to flatten the loop, then take a threaded needle and run it through the center of the ribbon, from the back to the front.
 Fold the center of the ribbon accordion-style, then wrap the thread around the center of the bow several times to tighten. Knot the thread and cut off any extra.
 Take a new piece of ribbon and tie a simple, loose knot. Place this knot over the center of the bow to cover up the stitches, then secure the two ends at the back of the bow using a little hot glue.
 Use the hot glue gun to attach the bow to the headband.

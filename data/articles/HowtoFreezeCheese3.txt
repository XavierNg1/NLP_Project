 These types will grate easily and freeze well in shredded form.
 This can either be done by hand using a stand-up shredder/grater or in a food processor that has a cheese shredding blade.
 Leave about a half an inch/1⁄5 centimeter (0.1 in) from the top of the bag.
 Press the bag flat as gently as you can to expel excess air before sealing. Label and date the bags.



If you have a lot of bags, arrange across a baking sheet first. Flatten the cheese inside as much as possible without damaging it. Then freeze. Once the bags are frozen, they can be stacked neatly one on top of the other.
 Break off or shake out the amount of shredded or grated cheese needed for cooking.


Shredded cheese can be placed on top of hot food to melt (such as pasta sauce) but it will also introduce a little moisture, so take this into account.

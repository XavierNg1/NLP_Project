 Cut a loop of white wire approximately 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3Â cm) in length. Hold this in your right hand with the ends pointing towards your fingertips, so that no one can see it.;
,, Walk up to your friend and tell them about a new iPod feature: it can now regenerate! You can skip the story if you just want to surprise them, but a good magician always has a mystical story to back up the trick.
 Assure your friend that no harm will come to their iPod, because you know what you're doing.
 Simultaneously stuff the ends of your secret loop into your left hand, which is now holding your victim's real cord. Make the fake loop stick out, and tuck the real loop into your hand, so that it looks like you're holding their cord, but you're really holding the secret cord.
 Hold up the "fake" loop and, using the scissors, cut it quickly. If you move too slowly, your friend will likely go to great lengths to protect their precious iPod. Show them the cut cord and take a moment to revel in their complete loss of hope for the future. Keep both the cut cord and the real cord tight in your fist.
 Sneak the broken cord back into your right hand as you pretend to "fix" the cord. Make a show of it, so that they don't notice you make any kind of transfer. Explain to them that Apple has now developed self-sealing electromagnetic particles, that react and fuse from the pressure and heat of being held tightly in your fists.
 Pull your hands apart, holding their unharmed cord taut, and show them that it has mysteriously put itself back together.
 The secret cord (now cut) should be tucked away in your right hand again. Stick it into your pocket or another hiding place as soon as you're able.

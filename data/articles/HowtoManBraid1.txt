 This is where your hair is longer at top and shaved down the sides. You will need this to get the right look., Place your thumbs to either side of your temples, right where your hair starts to get long. Push them back through your hair, angling them until they touch. Separate this section of hair from the rest. It should only be 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) deep., Hold the left section in you left hand and the right section in your right., Cross the left section over the middle one, then cross the right section over the middle one., Gather some hair from the left side of your part. Add it to the left strand. Cross the now-thicker left strand over the right one.

If you are having trouble with this, try crossing the left strand over first, then adding the strand to it (now in the middle)., Gather some hair from the right side of your part. Add it to the right section, then cross it over the middle one., This style of braiding is also known as "French braiding." When you have no more hair to gather into your "French" braid, stop.

Work in small sections and keep the braid nice and tight.
 If you want a regular bun, tie your hair off into a ponytail now with a clear hair elastic. If you want a braided bun, braid the rest of your hair like normal, then tie it off with a clear hair elastic.

To do a regular braid, simply cross the left and right strands over the middle one.
 If you left your hair as a ponytail, twist it into a rope first, then coil it into a bun. If you did a braid, simply coil it into a bun., Use your fingers to tuck the tail end of your ponytail/braid under the bun. Slide two or three bobby pins through the bun to help keep it together., Again, you don't really have to do this, but your braid will last a lot longer if you do, especially if your fade/undercut was not that long to begin with.

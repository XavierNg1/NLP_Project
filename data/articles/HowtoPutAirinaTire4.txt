 Automobile tire pressure gauges will not accurately reflect the much higher psi levels of bicycle tires.
 Follow the other steps outlined, including checking the pressure when the tire's cold, and following the bicycle manual's guidelines.









You can use an air compressor to fill bicycle tires. Make sure you pay close attention to what you are doing. Fill the tire in short bursts and check the pressure often until you reach the desired pressure.
 Because of their size and dimensions, bicycle tires react more quickly to changes in ambient air temperature, and psi will drop in cooler weather. For every 10° drop in temperature, tire pressure will drop about 2%.


For example, if you head out during the day riding on 100psi and the temp is 90, when you head home that night, and it's now 60°, your tire pressure will be about 94 psi—enough change to be a noticeable difference.
 A tire that rolls great at 100 psi on a smooth road will deliver a harder ride on rough road. To help with traction on wet days, drop your psi by about 10.

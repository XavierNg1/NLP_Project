 Laugh. Let people know that you're happy. Let your feelings shine through. It's perfectly normal.;
, When you see a girl you don't know, just go right up and greet her with something like, "Hi! I'm__________. I haven't talked to you before. What class are you in? What period do you have lunch?

, Be chatty. Have conversations with people around you. If you can't think of anything to say, admit it. Say something like,"I want to start a conversation with you, but I'm running outta things to say. You don't mind if I blab about the weather for a half hour, do you?"

, Some people actually say bad things about themselves purposely in hope of popularity. However, I suggest you say something positive about yourself. You don't have to brag, just BE POSITIVE! Example: If the teacher asks you to critique your own artwork, say, I think it's not that bad." If you think it isn't bad.
 Always use your best manners when speaking to others. When you did something wrong, apologize. If it's something big and it's your fault, express the way you feel about it.
 Give when you can. Forgive people if you can.
 When you are against something, show it. Let everyone know that you exist and that you have your own viewpoint on things.
 You wouldn't want anyone to think of you as a mean, nasty, or bossy person.
 It's not a good thing to do. Contrary to what many kids believe, it does not show maturity. More to the opposite, it displays immaturity.

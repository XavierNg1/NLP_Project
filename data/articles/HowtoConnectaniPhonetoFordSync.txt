 Put your key in the ignition and start your car. Once the car is running, press the car radio button on the center console of the dashboard to switch on the entertainment system.
 Tap the Settings icon from your iPhone’s home screen to go to its Settings. Scroll down the screen and tap “General” to access the General settings of your iPhone.
 Scroll down the General settings screen and tap “Bluetooth” to open your iPhone’s Bluetooth settings. Tap the toggle switch at the top of the screen to enable your iPhone’s Bluetooth connectivity.
 Once your iPhone’s Bluetooth and your Ford’s radio unit are both switched on, press the “Seek” button on your car’s steering wheel until the “Add Bluetooth Device” is displayed on the car radio screen.


Press the “OK” button on the steering wheel (just below the “Seek” button) and a six-digit pairing PIN will be displayed on the radio screen.
 Once the Bluetooth is enabled, your iPhone will start looking for other nearby Bluetooth devices it can connect to. To connect to your car’s Ford Sync, tap “SYNC” from the list of devices found by your iPhone displayed on the screen and you’ll be prompted to enter a PIN.

Type in the pairing PIN you got from the car radio and press the “Done” button on your iPhone’s screen. A notification will appear on the iPhone’s screen telling you that the pairing is successful if you entered the correct PIN.
There you have it! You've just connected your iPhone to your car’s Ford Sync.

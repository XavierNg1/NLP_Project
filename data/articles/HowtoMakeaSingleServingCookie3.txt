 First, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Then let your butter soften to room temperature, or microwave 2 tablespoons until it is only partially melted. In a small mixing bowl, stir the 2 tablespoons of butter with 3 tablespoons of sugar until they form a cream.Heating your butter too much may cause the egg to start cooking before you bake your cookie., First, crack your egg in a separate dish and whisk it until the white and the yolk combine evenly. Add 2 tablespoons of that to your butter and sugar, plus ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract. Stir until they are evenly mixed.


If desired, either use the leftover egg for other baking or cooking. If not using it immediately, seal it in an airtight container and use within the next 24 hours., Add 6 tablespoons of all-purpose sugar, ¼ teaspoon of baking soda, ⅛ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar. If desired, include 2 tablespoons of sprinkles. Stir them into your wet ingredients until your dough is evenly combined.Sugar cookies are soft to begin with, so don’t overdo the mixing. This will make your dough weaker and your cookies more likely to fall apart.
 Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll your dough into a ball about 3 inches thick (7.6 cm). Set the ball on the paper and place your sheet in the oven once it reaches the desired temperature. Set a timer for 14 to 16 minutes. Remove the cookie once the edges have begun to brown.The center will be soft at first, so set it on a cooling rack so it has time to grow firm.

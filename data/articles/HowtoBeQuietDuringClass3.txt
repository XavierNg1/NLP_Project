 You are going to have a much easier time refraining from making noise in class if you are paying attention, and if you understand what you are learning. One way to help ensure this is to come to class fully prepared. This means doing any assigned reading or other homework, bringing the proper books or other materials, and just making sure that you understand the unit you are covering. If you are not sure about what you’re learning, take some time to speak to your teacher and get caught up.Part of being prepared also means arriving on time.
Get to class a few minutes early, so that you can get out any books, notebooks, or other materials, and avoid rummaging through your bag during class. (This is another way to stay quiet.)

, If you talk because you are bored, you are missing out on your education. Even a slow lecture can be filled with interesting information. By keeping your mind on the class, you’’ll be reducing the temptation to talk just to pass the time., One tactic to help you stay engaged during class is to take notes. Write down what your teacher says in a way that will make sense to you later. Also, write down any questions you may have. Even doodling on a piece of scrap paper will occupy you enough to help keep you from talking or making noise, while still leaving you with enough focus to understand the teacher.
 Aside from just listening to what your teacher says, you can stay engaged and prevent yourself from making too much noise by actually participating in class. Whenever you think of a question or comment, raise your hand and state it. In addition to preventing you from talking, this is sure to improve your grade., Any class is going to be more interesting to you if you can find a way to engage with the material and apply it to your life. If you can stay engaged and interested, you are far less likely to talk or make noise during class. Maybe you can use some of the algebra you’ve been learning to calculate how much gas money you’ll need for an upcoming road trip; perhaps you can use some of the communication theories you’ve learned in sociology to help some friends solve an argument; or maybe a book you are reading in English class can be an analogy for your life. Even if it feels like a stretch, search for some way to make the material you are learning more personal.

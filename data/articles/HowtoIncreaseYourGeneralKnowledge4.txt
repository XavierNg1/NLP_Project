 Nearly all universities and colleges offer a general education program or classes outside of an area of expertise that cover a broad range of topics and approaches. The material taught in general education courses focuses on interdisciplinary information so that you can gain knowledge and apply it to real life situations.


If you decide to attend university, make sure you take classes in a variety of subjects to broaden your general knowledge.
Taking a diversity of classes has shown to make an impact in job interviews, collaborating with colleagues, and contributing to a community. , College campuses offer many opportunities to join one or several different clubs in whatever you are interested in. Surrounding yourself with people of different backgrounds, ethnicities, and interests will only help you to gain more general knowledge. Extracurricular activities enhance and refresh your mind and body which, in turn, will increase your ability to immerse yourself with new knowledge.
Search for other ways to expand your general knowledge by looking out for service projects, event planning, or writing a newsletter. These activities will help you to stay up to date on relevant information.
 Faculty knows how people learn, or at least they know more than most. It is not uncommon to find students in faculty offices during meeting hours to discuss lecture, assignments, or just about anything else. Make yourself one of those students who visit faculty during office hours. You will learn more than you ever imagined. Check your syllabus. That is where professors post their office hours for that semester. Or, you can usually find a schedule posted to their door or at the department assistantâ€™s office.
If you cannot meet during the assigned hours, call or email your professor to make an appointment during a different time.

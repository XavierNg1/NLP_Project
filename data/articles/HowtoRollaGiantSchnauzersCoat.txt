 All the bits that you never remove but just shape.;
, Concentrate on the feet first. When it comes to the head which is done last (on a mini it is done first) only blow from the top of the eyebrows down in the direction of which the hair sits. The dog must be fully dry.
 You can't overdo it, it will automatically make the coat harder. This cleans the coat and makes the hair easier to pull. For starters take up your 'Mars Coat King Original 16 Blade' and while your dog is standing/lying down taunt the skin via the neck and pull the mars through all the way. Remove the hair from it and repeat. Go 2-3 times in one spot then move to another. When it comes to the side and the legs, put the dog on its side. It makes it easier.
 Repeat what you did with the Mars coat king.
 On the same angle used for the stripping knife run it over the coat. If it becomes rounded run it on some concrete to create a flat edge. It works better this way. Go all over the coat. For the ears, take the stone and rub with the hair until it sits flat against the ear. Don't bother about the back of the ear.
 If the tail is docked don't strip out a lot. It should still remain fully covered in hair. Don't worry about the tip yet.
 Do this until the hair sits flat on the head.
 Pull out any hair that is randomly sticking out of the jacket with your fingers (you can also use a 'Greyhound Metal Stripping Stone either 8mm or 13mm). If you are satisfied with the coat, take the blow dryer and blow the rest of the grooming powder out and let your dog out for a bit of a run. He deserves it. Just don't let him get too dirty.

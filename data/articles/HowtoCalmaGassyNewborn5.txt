 If your baby is burping on their own, this means that there is air trapped inside of their body and you may need to take action to help relieve any potential discomfort. Try burping your baby or massing their belly.


Farting is also a tell-tale sign of gassiness in babies.
 Babies usually cry for a reason – it is one of the ways they communicate with you. A crying baby needs attention to figure out what they need and trapped air/gas might be the reason your baby is acting fussy, especially if your baby doesn’t usually act fussy very often.


If your baby is crying and you can determine the reason – you have fed them, changed them, and given them a nap – then your baby might have gas.
 If your baby seems bloated, with a slightly distended belly, this is probably due to excess gas in their abdomen. You don’t need to worry about this unless your baby is acting like he is uncomfortable.A gassy baby might also have a hard tummy. However, if the bloating or hardness get worse or don't go away, talk to your doctor.

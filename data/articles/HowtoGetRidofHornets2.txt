 A hornet's nest is a paper or mud-like construction often shaped like a pine cone, upside down beehive, or just a mass lump. Hornets will look for a sheltered location to make their nest, and such nests can be found under leaves, in tree branches, on windows, in attics, under rafters, inside abandoned buildings or vehicles, etc. Any space that is protected from the weather and undisturbed can attract hornets to nest.;

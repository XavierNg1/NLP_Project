 BUD/S candidates who have successfully completed “Hell Week,” in which they are awake for virtually five days, say that it is difficult to fall asleep when you are moving around. During Hell Week, BUD/S candidates are subjected to running, calisthenics, and exercises with logs and rubber boats.The soldiers are almost constantly in motion. Try some of the same techniques:


Run sprints or jog around the room.
Create an exercise circuit for yourself. Try doing 10 pushups, 10 sit-ups, 10 jumping jacks, and 10 air squats. Repeat this until you feel more awake.
Play a game of tag with a friend who is also trying to stay awake.
Throw a football or baseball with a friend.;
, Conversation can help you stay awake. Stories can capture your attention; laughing can help wake you up.


Tell your funniest story.
Discuss your most embarrassing moment.
Tell a suspense story.
Chat about what you will do when your period of extended wakefulness is over.
 Try games that make you use your brain, such as trivia or 20 Questions. Try games that force you to stand up and move around.


Play a game of chess, Monopoly, Trivial Pursuit, Risk, or other board game.
Shoot pool or play a game of darts.

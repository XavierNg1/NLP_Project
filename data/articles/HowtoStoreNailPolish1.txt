 Sticking labels painted with nail polish on the tops of your nail polish bottles is an easy way to organize them. By placing a painted label on top of each polish bottle, you will be able to quickly locate the color you want. Find some blank white sticky labels and a hole punch to get started.You can also use a hole punch that is in the shape of something, such as a heart or butterfly.
If you donâ€™t have sticky labels, then just use some plain white paper and secure it to the tops of your nail polish bottles with a piece of tape.;
, Start painting the labels with each of your nail polish colors. As you do so, make sure that you keep the bottles organized. Place them in rows that coincide with the way you have painted the labels.You may need to apply two coats of some nail polishes to ensure that the label accurately shows the color in the bottle.
Let the nail polish dry after you finish painting them.
 After the nail polish has dried, punch out a hole or shape over the painted area of the label. Then, stick the label pieces on their matching nail polish bottle tops.








If you are using tape and paper, then punch or cut out small pieces of painted paper and stick them onto the bottle tops with a small piece of tape.
 Now finding the nail polish color that you want will be much easier! Store your nail polish bottles any way you like, such as by using:Clear plastic totes
Shoeboxes
Drawers

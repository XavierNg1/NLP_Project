 Windows creates a disabled Administrator account automatically in all versions of Windows after XP. This account is disabled for security reasons, as the first personal account you create is an administrator by default. The following method will detail enabling the disabled Administrator account and then setting a password for it.


If you want to change your personal administrator account's password, open the Control Panel and select the "User Accounts" option. Select your personal administrator account and then click "Create a password" or "Change your password".;
, You should see "Command Prompt" appear in the list of search results.
, This will enable the Administrator account on the computer. The most common reason for activating the Administrator account is to perform automation work without having to deal with the User Access Control message appearing every time a system setting is changed., This will allow you to change the Administrator password.
 Characters will not appear as you type. Press â†µ Enter after typing the password.
 If the passwords do not match, you'll have to try again.
 This will disable the Administrator account. It is not recommended to keep the Administrator account active when you're not using it. Once you've set your password and performed any actions you need to as the Administrator, disable it through the Command Prompt.

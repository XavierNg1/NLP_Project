 Gossip, rumors and backstabbing conversations have no place when you're aiming to speak nicely. Complaining is also out. Find positive and constructive ways to explain yourself and the things that happen to you. Concentrate on what you want rather on how you wish other people would behave. Remember that you can't change other people but you can make it clear what you want to happen for yourself.


Beware sarcasm. It may feel witty and clever but it is barbed wit and it can hurt people who either don't get it or who realize that you are being damning about something they genuinely care about. That said, there are occasions where sarcasm can relieve tension, so use your best judgment knowing the people you're with. The best advice is to not make a habit of it.
Avoid being saccharin sweet. The "everything's great" attitude when things are clearly not great is annoying and people see through it quickly. It is better to acknowledge what isn't working at the same time as being upbeat rather than sugarcoating bad things.
 Even in times of hardship and difficulty, it is possible to relay information in a way that helps people rather than leaves them feeling sad, angry or at a loss. Look for ways to bring positive things to everyone's attention, all while acknowledging the hardship. This is as much a habit as always complaining is a habit, and with practice, you can turn it around.


For example, consider a situation of a power outage. Everyone is sitting around feeling miserable, complaining how cold and boring it is. You might say something like: "I know it's dark and cold in here but we can get the blankets out of the cupboard and wrap ourselves up in them, Johnny can cook us a cup of hot cocoa using the camping stove on the porch and we can play cards by candlelight." Finding the "nice" in difficult situations can help boost people's spirits immensely.

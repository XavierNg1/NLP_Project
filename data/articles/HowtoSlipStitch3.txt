 Slip stitches are generally used to sew hems such that there is not a line of visible stitches on the outside (or inside) of the garment. Pin your hem first to ensure that you'll sew in a straight line. Your hem should have a "fold" inside of it; i.e., it should look something like you folded the bottom of the fabric up an inch or so, then folded that another inch (or whatever hem width you're using).,,, Don't put the needle all the way through the fabric and then bring it back, as you would in traditional sewing. Instead, guide the tip of the needle under three or four of the textile's threads. Weaving the stitch this way will prevent obvious bunching or pulling on the outside of the garment.
 Close to where you drew the needle out of the fold, point it back in, keeping the needle parallel to the fold. You'll be moving lengthwise along the fold as you continue.
 Again, grab a few threads of the fabric just above the point where the needle exited.
, When you're finished sewing the hem, tie off such that the knot is located inside the fold.

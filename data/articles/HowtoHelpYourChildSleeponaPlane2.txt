 These means doing the activities that your child’s usual bedtime routine would involve, including brushing her teeth, reading bedtime stories, and getting into her pajamas. Tell your child its time to get ready for bed; take her to the washroom to brush her teeth, help her change into her pajamas, and read her a bedtime story when you both get back to your seat.


Make sure to turn off the reading light, and get rid of any other gadgets or seat back movies that might be on.
 Milk is a good source of tryptophan, a sleep-inducing substance that can help your child get a restful sleep, even on a plane.While giving your child her milk, make sure to avoid giving her a snack that contains sugar along with her milk, as sugar can give your child a boost of energy.
 Consider giving your child a sugar-free oatmeal cookie, because oatmeal is a slow release carbohydrate that will be less likely to disturb your child’s tummy.
 If your child absolutely has no desire to sleep during a plane ride, then there’s also absolutely nothing that the other passengers and flight crew can do about it – so you shouldn’t be pressured to do anything about it either. Instead, give your child quiet activities to do while on the flight. This could be:


Playing with a tablet.
Reading a book.
Walking up and down the aisles (with you of course).
Watching an inflight movie.
 If your child was not sleepy when you got on the flight, and she has now played games for awhile, watch her for signs of sleepiness. If she begins rubbing her eyes or yawning, take this moment to give her some milk and let her listen to her favorite lullabies on your Ipod.


Once she has been asleep for awhile, you can ever so cautiously play a blanket over her. Lower the window if you can to keep the light out if you are on a daytime flight.

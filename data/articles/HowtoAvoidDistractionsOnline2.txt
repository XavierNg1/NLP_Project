 Tell yourself that your work phone or computer should only be used for work-related business. This will help you separate your work and leisure technologies and make it easier to stay on task when you’re working. For example, if you want to take a five-minute break to scroll through the news, do so on your personal phone or tablet and switch back to your work computer when you’re done.
 Knowing beforehand what you want to accomplish online will keep you more focused while browsing the Internet. Before you open your browser, for example, set a goal of completing research for a paper within one hour., Before resorting to technological tools, try setting self-imposed limits for yourself. For example, set a timer for ten minutes before allowing yourself to check a news site., Have a friend message you every few hours to keep you on task. If you receive and read the message, that probably means you’re not focused!

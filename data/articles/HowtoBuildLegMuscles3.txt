 To get bigger muscles, you need extra fuel. The calories you consume, however, should not come from fast food and junk food - eating too much of those will just slow you down. Eat plenty of calories from healthy, whole foods to keep your body feeling powerful.


Eat lean meats, fish, eggs, and dairy.
Nuts, avocados, and whole grains are also great.
Eat tons of fruits and vegetables.
Choose healthy fats provided by seed and nut oils, coconut oil, and olive oil. Minimize the trans fats and animal fats found in processed and fried foods.
 The body uses protein to build muscles, so you'll need extra during this time. Eat beef, pork, chicken, fish, eggs, and cheese. Eat beans, legumes, and tofu for non-animal protein sources. If you are struggling to get enough protein in your diet, try protein shakes or drink more milk.


You can try supplements such as creatine. Studies show that creatine supplements can safely help build up the muscles when taken with daily meals.
 Your body will need more water than usual to stay hydrated when you're training heavily. Water also helps flush toxins from the body and is essential for healthy digestion. Aim to drink at least 10 8-ounce glasses of water every day while you're training.

 If you have a well-trained and obedient dog, you could try to make him/her sit and then hide some treats around in the room where you are. Then when you say "Go"! The dog will run around, trying to find all the treats! Remember to hide the treat a place your dog can reach.;
, Remember the game you used to play when you was a kid? Maybe your kids play it, but it's not just for humans! Like the previous step, this requires an obedient and well-trained dog. Make the dog wait sitting down somewhere, facing a wall or better yet, a corner. Then you hide! Be careful, sometimes the dog peeks! And don't make too much noise hiding. Then call the dogs name and wait for the dog to find you! Note that this play works the best if you are alone with your dog at home, because other people can distract the dog.
 This requires a garden and an old sheet. Find an old sheet that you don't use, and go out to your garden with your dog. Now, run around with the sheet behind you and watch your dog go crazy, trying to catch it!

, This requires a laser pointer. Use the laser pointer to make your dog (or cat) go mad! Point it around on the floor, and at the walls and watch your pet trying to get a hold of it! Don't point the laser at your pet's eye though, it can harm.

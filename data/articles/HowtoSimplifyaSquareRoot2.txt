 Squaring a number, or multiplying it by itself, creates a perfect square. For example, 25 is a perfect square because 5 x 5, or 52, equals 25. Memorizing at least the first ten perfect squares can help you recognize and quickly simplify perfect square roots. Here are the first ten perfect squares:


12 = 1
22 = 4
32 = 9
42 = 16
52 = 25
62 = 36
72 = 49
82 = 64
92 = 81
102 = 100

, If you recognize a perfect square under a square root symbol, you can immediately turn it into its square root and get rid of the radical sign (√). For example, if you see the number 25 under the square root sign, you know that the answer is 5 because 25 is a perfect square. Here's the same list as above, going from the square root to the answer:


√1 = 1
√4 = 2
√9 = 3
√16 = 4
√25 = 5
√36 = 6
√49 = 7
√64 = 8
√81 = 9
√100 = 10

, Use the perfect squares to your advantage when following the factor method of simplifying square roots. If you notice a way to factor out a perfect square, it can save you time and effort. Here are some tips:


√50 = √(25 x 2) = 5√2. If the last two digits of a number end in 25, 50, or 75, you can always factor out 25.
√1700 = √(100 x 17) = 10√17. If the last two digits end in 00, you can always factor out 100.
√72 = √(9 x 8) = 3√8. Recognizing multiples of nine is often helpful. There's a trick to it: if all digits in a number add up to nine, then nine is always a factor.
√12 = √(4 x 3) = 2√3. There's no special trick here, but it's usually easy to check whether a small number is divisible by 4. Keep this in mind when looking for factors.
 If the number's factors contain more than one perfect square, move them all outside the radical symbol. If you found multiple perfect squares during your simplification process, move all of their square roots to the outside of the √ symbol and multiply them together. For example, let's simplify √72:


√72 = √(9 x 8)
√72 = √(9 x 4 x 2)
√72 = √(9) x √(4) x √(2)
√72 = 3 x 2 x √2
√72 = 6√2

 It's important to understand that all children learn differently. Your child will also learn at a speed that might be different from others. However, you can use general guidelines to know when your child is ready to start learning certain new skills.Getting dressed is one of the first steps a child takes towards independence. At about two years old, your child might be ready to start taking off her own coat and shoes.
She might also be ready to start helping pull her pants up, and find the armholes in shirts.
Talk to your doctor about your child's individual development. He can help you make sure your child is progressing at an appropriate rate.
 Your child will learn best by watching you. Take care to patiently demonstrate many parts of your daily routine. For example, when you brush your teeth, bend down to your child's eye level so that she can see what you are doing.Try to focus on what your child does well, not what she does wrong. Say, "Great job putting the toothpaste on the brush! You did it just like I did!"

, Good communication is key to helping your child learn. Make sure to speak calmly, but enthusiastically. Make eye contact with your child, and make sure that she is paying attention when you speak.Smiling is a great way to reinforce what you are saying.
Offer hugs as a way to provide affection when you are teaching a new skill.
Allow your child to ask lots of questions when you are teaching a new skill.

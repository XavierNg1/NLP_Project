 Evaporative coolers work best with very low relative humidity and hot temperatures. If the average humidity in your area is 40-50%, an evaporative cooler will not work properly.;
, Your swamp cooler will need a lot of waterâ€”as the name implies, it works by evaporation, so make sure you have plenty to go.
 Swamp coolers will increase the humidity in your home significantly, so you need to have very good ventilation. Homes built for evaporative coolers will have the ductwork in place, but for most retrofit installations, you'll want windows opened. I know, you grew up with your dad telling you "close the windows, we aren't cooling the neighborhood," but with swamp coolers that's exactly what you want to do!

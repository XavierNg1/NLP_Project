 MediaMonkey is a popular music player and management program for Windows, and you can use it to sync your music to your iPhone if you tweak a few settings.


You'll still need to install a few iTunes services in order to sync your iPhone with MediaMonkey, but you won't need to use the iTunes program at all.
MediaMonkey can only sync your music files. It won't be able to sync videos and pictures. If you need to be able to sync these, you'll want to consider setting up MusicMonkey to just handle the music syncing, and leave the rest to iTunes.
 If you don't want to use iTunes at all, this step will help you just install the necessary services the iPhone needs to connect to MediaMonkey. If you want to use iTunes to manage your videos, images, and backups, install iTunes like normal.Download the iTunes installer from apple.com/itunes/download/.
Rename the iTunesSetup.exe (or iTunes64Setup.exe) to iTunesSetup.zip (or iTunes64Setup.zip).
Double-click the .zip file to open it and find AppleMobileDeviceSupport.msi (or AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi). Drag this onto your desktop.
Double-click the file on your desktop to install the connection service.
Download and install QuickTime for Windows. You can get it from apple.com/quicktime/download/.
 If you plan to use iTunes to handle your pictures, videos, and backups, you'll want to disable music syncing so that nothing gets overwritten when you connect your iPhone to your computer. If you're not using iTunes at all and only installed the necessary services, you can skip this step.


Click the "Edit" menu and select "Preferences". If you don't see the "Edit" menu, press Alt.
Click the "Devices" tab and check "Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically".
Click the "Store" tab and uncheck "Automatically download album artwork".
Connect your iPhone and select it from the row of buttons at the top of the iTunes window. In the window that opens, scroll down and uncheck "Automatically sync when this iPhone is connected".
Click the "Music" tab in the left frame and uncheck "Sync Music" if it's checked. Repeat for the "Podcasts" tab if you want MediaMonkey to handle your podcasts.
 You can close iTunes if you have it, as it will no longer be necessary. You will still need the iTunes services installed, however.
 This will open the iPhone's Summary page.
 This will allow you to choose if you want songs that aren't selected for syncing to be deleted from the iPhone or kept, as well as if the iPhone should sync automatically as soon as it is connected.
 You can use these options to set how your music will be imported, how album art will be handled, and other importing options.
 You can import and manage all of your music using MediaMonkey's library tools. You can tell MediaMonkey to monitor folders to keep your library automatically updated, and you can also drag and drop files and folders into the MediaMonkey window to add them to your library.
 Once you've added your music and configured your settings, you can start syncing your music collection to your iPhone. There are a couple of different ways that you can do this:


Right-click on a song or selection of songs and select "Send To" â†’ "Your iPhone". The selected songs will be immediately synced to your iPhone.
Select your device and click the "Auto-Sync" tab. You can then select artists, albums, genres, and playlists that you want to keep automatically synced. Click the "Apply" button to save your changes and start the sync process.

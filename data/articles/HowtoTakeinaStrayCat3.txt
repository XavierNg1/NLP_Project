 Strays tend to get attached to one person, not everybody. Most likely, that will be you because you're feeding it and caring for it directly. Don't be surprised if the cat runs off when introduced to new people, including household members. Give the cat plenty of time to get used to everyone. In some cases, the cat will never be happy with anyone but you, but may tolerate others from a distance. It depends on the cat's prior experiences and how other people react around it.

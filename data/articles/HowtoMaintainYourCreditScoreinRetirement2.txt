 You are entitled to a free copy of your credit report each year from each of the three major credit reporting agencies. You should make a practice of requesting this report each year. Review it carefully and compare it with the report from the year before. If you notice that the score has decreased, you should try to identify the reason and make any necessary corrections.You can reach the three reporting agencies to request your score and free report as follows:

TransUnion - www.transunion.com, or 877-322-8228Experian - www.experian.com, or 888-397-3742Equifax - www.equifax.com, or 800-685-1111


Alternatively, new companies like Creditkarma.com offer free checks of your credit score.
 When you review your credit report, you should look for any suspicious activity. If you see any reported accounts or purchases that you think are inaccurate, you should contact the reporting agency right away. Their websites contain multiple options for you to contact customer service, either by phone, mail or email.When you call, you should have your copy of the credit report with you. Circle or highlight the questionable items you want to discuss. Keep a pad of paper with you and take notes of the phone call. Get the name and contact number of the person you speak with. Take careful notes of any recommendations or suggestions.
Find out what the agency says it will do to investigate your concern. Ask how long it will take. Follow up again, by phone or in writing, if that time passes and you have not heard anything back from them.
 Each time you apply for credit, the lender must check your credit report. Each check like that registers as a mark against your credit score. Obviously, if you need the credit and know what you are doing, then go ahead. But do not apply haphazardly for credit accounts, as too many inquiries can damage your overall credit score.When you monitor your annual credit report, you should see a report of all credit inquiries. If you see inquiries that you do not recognize as requests that you initiated, you should ask the credit agency to investigate. If the inquiry cannot be verified as one that you initiated, you can have it removed to improve your credit score.

, You should hit your target, because even if your M-4 doesn't have a powerful scope, your aim was already set if you haven't moved.
 This is harder to learn, but easier to use. Basically you want to find out where is the point on your binocular display, that corresponds to your M-4 shouldered aiming point. When you know it, it will be the same as with any scoped weapon (see above), but because the binoculars don't have it marked as cross hairs, you'd have to find it and memorize it's location somehow.

 While some people dog-proof their offices to keep pets out, others want to make their canine co-workers feel welcome. Putting a special bed or crate in your office will give the dog a sense of space that is all their own. This can also help keep your pet away from parts of the room you’d prefer they don’t pant around in., If your co-workers are canines, they’ll need special projects to work on, too. Set aside a basket, box, or other container and fill it with chew toys and other attention grabbing toys. You can then rest assured that your pup will be preoccupied when you take that conference call., For those who want to work beside their pets, having an ample supply of food, treats, and water can keep your pet preoccupied. Your dog will be less likely to go after your lunch or afternoon snack if she has a meal of her own waiting by the bookshelf.


Keep food and water messes at bay by placing your dog’s food and water bowl on a rug or plastic mat made specifically for dog bowls.

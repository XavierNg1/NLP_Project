 Make sure they are big enough so that you may have the stocking size you desire. The color of the felt can be whatever shade you want.;
, Get the other piece of felt and repeat this step. Be sure that you are certain about the stocking size, as once you start on it, there is no turning back!

, Cut it in half to where it makes a long rectangle - long enough to go around the stocking.
 Thread the needle. Sew the two halves of the stockings together from the sides.
 Sew them up if you discover any.
 Wrap it around the top of your stocking and sew it on.
 If there isn't any and you sewed it a little too low for that to happen, it's fine!

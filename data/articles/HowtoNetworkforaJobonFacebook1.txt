 When you network with potential employers and organizations, they will review your Facebook profile before considering you for a position in their company.


Enter your professional information into the "About Me," "Work and Education," and "Contact Information" fields. For example, enter your professional email address into the contact field, instead of your personal email address.;
, Hiring companies and recruiters will often determine whether you are a good fit for a position based on your relevant, past experience. For example, when looking for a new job in computer programming, list your last 2 or 3 programming positions instead of positions related to your previous experience at a fast food restaurant.
 The users you network with will use your photo to form a first impression of you. For example, upload a photo of yourself wearing business casual attire, instead of a photo of yourself on summer vacation at the beach.
 The keywords you include in your profile will appear in search results when hiring companies and recruiters search for new job candidates. For example, when looking for a new position as a hairstylist, include keywords such as "haircut" or "hair styling" in the "About Me" or "Interests" sections of your profile.

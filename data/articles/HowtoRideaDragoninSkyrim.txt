 Roam around the open world of Skyrim. Keep an eye out on the sky for any signs of a dragon flying. Once you find one, go towards the direction where you see the dragon.;
, Once you’re near the dragon, open your in-game menu and select “Magic.” Choose “Shouts” from the menu panel on the right-hand side of the game screen and select “Bend Will.”


Aim at the dragon and press the “Action” button to use the shout against the monster. The dragon will land on the ground without attacking you.
If you don’t have the Bend Will shout, you can get it by completing the “Garden of Men” quest—the sixth mission in Skyrim’s main storyline.
 Approach the dragon and press the “Ride” button prompted on the game screen to mount the beast. Once you’re on its back, the dragon will automatically take flight.
 You can steer the beast by pressing the direction keys on your controller. You can go either left or right, upward or downward.
 While you’re riding a dragon, you can order it to attack targets using it fire breath. Once you find a target, press and hold the “Lock” button on your game controller to fix your camera focus on the mark.


Once you’ve locked on your prey, press and hold the “Attack” button to make your dragon breath fire at your target. You can incinerate and kill your mark in one attack, depending on its character level.
 Once you’ve arrived at your location or you’re ready to get off, press the “Land” button on your controller and the dragon will slowly descend to land. Once it touches the ground, your character will automatically dismount the dragon and go back to walking.


After dismounting the dragon, you can either leave it alone or kill it.

 Another great way to convey new information to someone is to compare it to something he or she is familiar with. Find out what your client does or is interested in, and compare SEO to that.For example:


If your client is the manager of a lakeside hotel resort, then compare SEO to the hotel business. In this case, you could compare good reviews to good links (authority), and the things the hotel has to offer, such as a sauna and a lakeside view, to a website's content and keywords.
 Some people are visual learners, and may require some sort of illustration (such as a chart or diagram) to help understand things. For example, if you are explaining the different aspects of SEO, consider drawing a circle on a piece of paper, and labeling it with that aspect. Then, move your pen, pencil, or finger over each bubble as you talk about it.


You could also consider drawing a comic where Person A asks Person B questions about how SEO works, and Person A answers them., If you are meeting your client in person, open up a search engine and type in the terms one would use to find his or her website. For example, if your client is a residential architect, specializing in exterior design, type the words "residential architect exterior design" followed by the city name. If your client's website does not show up on the first page, but his or her competitor's does, he or she might then realize the importance of SEO.

 You will be placing food on this wood so you want to make sure no debris or rough edges are on the moldings. If sanding is required, sand first and then clean with warm water and mild dish detergent.

Paint, gloss or stain moldings if you did not purchase pre-painted wood. Consider adding a final gloss coat at the end to seal the wood and protect it from food spills.






Allow ample dry time before securing it to the box.
 Secure the sides together with wood glue and possibly following up with small nails.


Stain or paint the box. Be sure you allow plenty of time for it to dry before completing the final step.
 Turn the box upside down so the open top is on the surface and the back is facing upward.


Add a copious amount of glue to the top of the box and then gently set the crown molding in place.

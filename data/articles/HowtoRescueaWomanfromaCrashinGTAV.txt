 Since this is a timed event, driving a fast vehicle is beneficial, such as Franklinâ€™s Bravado Buffalo S, The Comet, or The Infernus (both of which can be found on the streets of downtown and affluent neighborhoods).;
, The car crash took place northeast of Mount Chiliad, near Braddock Pass. You will find Taliana next to the road, beside the crashed car.
 Get back into your vehicle and wait for her to enter it too. She will explain the situation and tell you where she wants to be driven: 7184 Cholla Springs Ave, Sandy Shores., Follow the navigation on your minimap. You will only have 2 minutes and 50 seconds to reach the location. If you take her to the location within the time limit, you will unlock her as a crew member for heists.The time limit is in real time, not game time.
If you fail to reach the location within the time frame, she will die.
If she dies, you can obtain the money she drops. She has the same amount of money as most NPCs (Non-Playable Characters).
You can attempt this event again, as it will re-occur at a random time much later in the game.

 Sites such as GameFly.com, Amazon.com, and BestBuy.com sell used games.
 You can either enter it into the site's search bar or manually browse the site's catalog by console and genre to find it.
 This will take you to a standard Internet checkout procedure, where the site will ask for your name, shipping and billing address, credit card information, email, and phone number.


Some online retailers send you a confirmation email with the details of your order. Save this email for your records. You can use it as proof of your purchase in case your game is defective.

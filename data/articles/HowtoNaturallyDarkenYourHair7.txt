 Add enough water for roughly 3 cups of coffee. Add at least double the amount of ground coffee that you would normally use for drinking.
 Be careful not to burn yourself. You can allow the coffee to cool down at room temperature, or you can place it in the refrigerator to cool it quicker.
 Place your head in the sink or stand in the shower, then rinse your hair at least three times with the coffee.


Another method would be to pour the coffee into a large bowl and then dip your hair into it and hold it there for several seconds.
 Remove the coffee from your hair using lukewarm water.
 You should find that your hair becomes a couple of shades darker each time you follow this method.
 Mix 2 cups (480 ml) of leave-in conditioner with 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) of organic coffee grounds and 1 cup (240 ml) of brewed coffee (ensure that the coffee is cold first!). Add this to your hair and leave it in for about an hour before rinsing it out.

When working with bleach, it is best to avoid using other chemicals or cleaners, since many will have a chemical reaction with the bleach that may produce a toxic gas.
It is also wise to keep the room well-ventilated by opening windows and doors. Do not work with bleach in a closed room.
 Dip a scrubbing brush into the bleach and use it to wash kitchen floors, counters, car tires, decks, or other contaminated hard surfaces.









Do not use this solution on carpets, upholstery, or other fabrics since bleach is likely to stain fabrics.
Avoid using this solution on clothes. You can add bleach to whites, according to label directions, but darker colors should not be bleached.
If you do not have a scrubbing brush, you could also use a clean rag or abrasive sponge.
To protect your hands, you may want to wear rubber cleaning gloves as you work with the bleach solution.
 Wash off the bleach with warm water. Repeat the process as necessary in order to remove the smell.









Wipe bleached surfaces with a clean water-soaked rag or mop.
Dry with a clean, dry cloth after finishing.

 Take the fruit out and eat it if you like, just make sure you keep the skin.;
, Using the inner lining of the banana skin, begin to rub it all over your shoes, just as you would if you were using polish. It may feel strange to be doing this (and it is) but don't worry, it does work.
 Once you have wiped the banana skin over the whole of both shoes, buff them up with a soft cloth.
 They'll come up shiny and almost like new again: perfectly polished shoes, organic style.

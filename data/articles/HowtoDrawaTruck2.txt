 This shape will be the side view of the vehicle. The rectangle will serve as the entire length of the truck. This is only the foundation of the truck drawing. The lines will be modified and erased as the picture progresses.



One is drawn near the front and one near the back.
The two circles should be the same size. Because this is the side view, only two tires are seen.
Erase the lines inside the circles that were created when the rectangle was drawn.



Draw a smaller rectangle on top and near the front of the longer rectangle.
Make the side of the rectangle that is nearest the front of the truck have a slanted side. The slant will serve as the windshield.



Draw a circle inside each of the wheels.
Draw a third, smaller, circle inside each of the previously drawn circles.
Add upside down "u" shapes above each tire. Each side of the "u" should meet the bottom of the long rectangle. Erase any rectangle lines that are seen in the middle of the "u" shape.
 The ends of the "u" should touch the front of the truck. Erase any lines from the initial rectangle that are visible inside of the "u" shape.
, The shape will look like a trapezoid on the half nearest the front of the truck (have a slanted side). The back half of the shape should be a rectangle (have a straight side).



The flat part of the semi-circle should face the back of the truck and the rounded part face the front of the truck.
, This line will separate the cab section from the bed of the truck.
 This will form the door.
 A gas tank cover, stripes, decals and other details are optional.

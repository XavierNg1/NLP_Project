 Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic skin disorder that presents itself as a red, scaly and itchy rash which is sensitive to the touch and can involve some swelling. People with eczema lack certain proteins in their skin and certain conditions can worsen their condition.Learn to recognize the triggers of eczema and avoid them, such as:


Skin infections
Allergens such as pollen, mold, dust mites, animals, or foods
Cold and dry air in the winter, getting too hot or too cold, or sudden changes of temperature
Chemical irritants or rough materials, such as wool
Emotional stress
Perfumes or dyes added to skin lotions or soaps

, You may not be able to avoid all of your triggers, especially if you're allergic to things like pollen. Talk to your doctor about possible allergy treatments to help reduce your symptoms., Taking too many baths or showers can strip the skin of its natural oils, which can cause excess dryness.Limit your baths and showers to maximum of 10 to 15 minutes.
When taking baths, use warm water instead of hot
After the shower, use a soft towel to gently pat dry your skin.
Use only mild and gentle shower cleansers or soaps. Mild, hypoallergenic soaps and shower oils are gentle and do not strip the skin out of its protective natural oils.Avoid using anti-bacterial or alcohol-based cleansers, which can easily dry your skin.
Choose shower cleansers with added moisturizers.
 Moisturizers help seal in the skinâ€™s natural moisture and thus keep it protected and hydrated.Moisturized skin is tougher against irritation, such as against harsh fabrics rubbing or scratching against the skin, and help prevent eczema flare ups.
Also apply moisturizer right after you pat dry after a bath or shower.

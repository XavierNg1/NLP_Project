 Pour the cake mix into a lined 9 x 13" baking dish. Place in the oven and bake according to the package instructions.;
, Leave to cool for 15 minutes in the baking dish. After 15 minutes, turn the cake out into a cake serving platter and leave to cool completely.


Once cooled, place the cake in the freezer.
 Beat together the cream cheese, whipped topping and powdered sugar. Once smooth, the frosting is ready and it is time to remove the cake from the freezer to add the frosting.
 At this stage, assess whether or not the berries will stay on the frosting, or are at risk of sliding off. If the frosting seems too runny, remove any berries already added, and place the cake back in the freezer for another 15-45 minutes.
 Wash the blueberries and set them aside to dry on a cooling rack or on paper towel. Gently wash the raspberries or strawberries. If using strawberries, hull them after washing. Again, leave to dry - you don't want to add too much moisture to the top of the cake.
 The aim is to make the cake appear like the American flag:


Make the corner "stars" from blueberries. Do this by marking the outside of the square first, then infilling with the remaining blueberries. Try to keep this neat and uniform for the best appearance, with even white spaces showing through.
Add the "stripes". You can draw a toothpick across the frosting at even intervals to create the rows before adding the berries; the indentation will give the berries something to sit in. If you are using raspberries, simply make 7 rows across the cake, leaving 6 white stripes in between. If you are using strawberries, either cut them in halves, or slice them, depending on what look you are trying to achieve.
If you're short of time and patience, use whipped cream in place of frosting. Fresh cream should only be an at-home option, however, as it needs to stay refrigerated prior to serving, and won't be the best option for picnicking.

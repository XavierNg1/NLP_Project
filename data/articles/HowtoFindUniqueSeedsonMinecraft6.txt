 This is a fairly standard survival island map, with one twist â€” there's only one tree near the spawn, and it isn't on your starting island! The swim to the nearby island will cost you precious time and hunger points, putting you at a disadvantage in survival mode. An entertaining map for players looking for a challenge.
 This seed gives a large, lush world full of various features. One of the most noticeable features, however, are the large floating islands near some of the map's mountains. Making a journey up to these isn't easy, but it's a rewarding experience (not to mention the fact that floating islands make great fortresses in survival mode.)

, Strangely, you can get an amazing world in the Xbox One version of the game by using the name of the console as your seed. This world has almost everything you could ask for: many different biomes, a varied landscape, and plenty of resources, making it a memorable map for basically any game mode.

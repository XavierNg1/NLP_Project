 In order to use your prepaid credit card for online purchases, you'll need to register it with the card issuer. This will allow you to set a billing address for the card, which Amazon requires.You can either call the number printed on the back of the card to register it over the phone, or you can visit the issuer's website and register it online. Make sure to enter in your valid address when registering the card., Once your card is registered, you'll be able to use it for online purchases. Log into Amazon so that you can add it to your account as a payment method.
 This will open your Amazon account page.
 You'll find this in the "Payment Methods" column of the "Amazon Wallet" section.
 Make sure to enter your name the same way you did when you registered your card, or the same way that it's printed on the card itself. Not all prepaid cards will have your name printed on them.
 Enter the billing address you used when you registered your card. The address will need to match exactly, or your card will be declined.
 You can now complete a purchase and select your prepaid card as the payment method. Make sure that your card has a balance to cover the purchase cost as well as the shipping fee.
 If your prepaid card is declined when you try to complete your purchase, your billing information likely does not match the address you registered with. Check the billing address entered in Amazon and register your prepaid card if you haven't yet.

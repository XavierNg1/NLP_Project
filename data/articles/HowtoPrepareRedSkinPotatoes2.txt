, If desired, peel potatoes, although peeling is not necessary. Many prefer the color and texture of the skin in the final dish.
 The smaller the cut, the quicker the potatoes will cook.


Use a glass baking dish if possible. A glass baking dish will allow the potatoes to cook more evenly, as glass is an excellent conductor of heat.
, Perhaps try:


3-4 cloves of garlic, whole or chopped.
1 teaspoon (1 g) dried rosemary
1 teaspoon (1 g) dried thyme
1 teaspoon (1 g) dried oregano
1 teaspoon (1 g) crushed red pepper flakes

, A quarter-teaspoon should be sufficient.
 Stir about every 10 minutes. Thicker-cut potatoes will take about an hour to cook, while smaller-cut potatoes closer to 50 minutes.

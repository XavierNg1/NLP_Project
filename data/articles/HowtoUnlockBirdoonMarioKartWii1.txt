 From here you will see several options including "Grand Prix, "Time Trial," "Vs," and "Battle." Birdo can be unlocked right off the bat, since you start the game with 16 courses, and you need to race a time trial on 16 different courses to unlock her. As such, Birdo is often one of the first characters you unlock.;
, The driver and kart you use does not matter. You will need to actually race, as you need to post a time in order to count the track towards your 16, but luckily enough posting times is not incredibly difficult. You just need to finish the race. To keep track of things just race the courses in order, doing all 4 tracks in the first 4 cups. Some tips for good time trial times include:


Use heavy riders (Bowser, Wario, Donkey Kong), as they have the best top speeds and there are no items or other riders to slow you down. This minimizes the impact of their slow accelerations
Perfect the start boost -- hit the A button right when the "GO" pops up to speed up fast and shave precious seconds off your time.
Learn all the shortcuts on the track. While you won't need them to unlock Birdo, you will need them to unlock other characters from time trials., Hit the "B" button to back all the way out of the time trial screen back to the main menu. Log back in using the same profile you raced the time trials in and you should get a notification that you've unlocked Birdo.


Remember, you need to do a time trial on 16 different courses, not just 16 trials.
If you are sure you raced 16 courses, but can't get Birdo unlocked, race a full Grand Prix. You should unlock Birdo when you are done., This will likely take longer than racing the time trials, but if you love playing online it may be the best use of your time.You can also race 1,350 unique races (any race, any time) in any mode to unlock the pink dino through sheer time spent playing.

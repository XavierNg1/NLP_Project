 Some appliance labels do not list watts. In this situation, look for an amp or "A" measurement instead.


Laptop and phone chargers may list two amp values. Use the one labeled input., In the United States and a few other countries, the standard household voltage is 120V. In the EU and most of the rest of the world, the voltage is between 220 and 240V.In the US, some large appliances such as washing machines may be plugged into special 240V circuits. Check the appliance label's voltage rating to find out. (The label only tells you the recommended voltage, but you can assume a professionally installed appliance matches this recommendation.)

, Multiplying amps and volts gives you an answer in watts, or electrical power.



Example: A microwave label lists 6.5 amps and is plugged into a 120V outlet. It consumes 6.5 amps x 120 volts = 780 watts.
 The wattage tells you the rate energy is consumed while the appliance is active. Multiply the wattage by the number of hours the device runs during an average day.



Example: If the microwave runs for half an hour each day, multiply 780 watts x 0.5 hours / day = 390 watt hours per day.
 This converts from watt hours to kilowatt hours.



Example: 390 watt hours / day รท 1000 watts / kilowatt = 0.39 kilowatt hours per day.
 For example, if you want to find out how many kilowatt hours you'll be charged for during a 31-day billing cycle, multiply your answer by 31 days.



Example: 0.39 kilowatt hours / day x 31 days = 12.09 kilowatt hours.

 Glass is a tricky material, so some types of paint will work better than others. For best results use “glass paint” - also known as acrylic enamel paint.This type of paint will stick more strongly to glass than others and will also dry with a glossy sheen that resists scratching and peeling. Other paints will work fine, but multiple coats are advised to ensure that they stick and provide ample coverage.


Fully painted jars work best when you do not want or care to see the contents. When using a jar as a terrarium or flower pot, for example, you could paint over the dirt and make it so only the plants themselves are visible.
It is not recommended to paint jars that you intend to use with food. Most paints are harmful when consumed, though a few select brands are considered food-safe., If you want to decorate your jar but still see the contents, the lid is still fully customizable. If the lid is also made of glass, then use specifically designed glass paint. If the lid is made from metal, spray paint would stick to it best., Bows can be tied around the neck of the jar and glued in place so they do not move. You can also glue ribbon and twine all the way around a jar, spiraling up from the bottom to the top and cover the entire jar. This can be layered on top of an already painted jar to give a dimensional and decorative look.
 Depending on what you store inside of the jar, you could glue a sample piece to the lid as a visual representation of its contents. If the jar is purely for decoration, then you can attach whatever you think looks nice instead. Dried leaves, flowers, or glass beads can all be positioned and fixed in place with an adhesive like hot glue or super glue.


Some glues, like wood glue and Elmer’s glue, do not work on glass. For best results use hot glue, super glue, or epoxy.

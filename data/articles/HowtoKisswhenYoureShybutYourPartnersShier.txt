 If the two of you are shy it is very unlikely for both of you to want to kiss in public; after all, kissing in front of others is not always a good idea. Find a place where you are both feeling very comfortable because it might also allow you to kiss contentedly. As long as it is calm and comfy, the place does not have to be one where candles are lit or flowers are scattered. That would be the first step in which both of your bashfulness would start wearing away.;
, When both of you are in a relaxed atmosphere you shouldn't stay silent. It is true that kissing does not require conversations but in your case it does. You should get your partner to become in deep need of that kiss and one way is by making a short conversation that describes to him/her how much you like and want him/her.
 Since both of you are shy, sitting would be a better idea than standing. Once you're seated, make eye contact. Eye contact is very difficult for those who are shy, but in this situation, it is very necessary. When you are both looking at each other's eyes you will notice how your partner's eyes will slowly look down and focus on your lips instead. Your partner will then get closer to you while you should remain where you were.
 Holding hands will make the need for the kiss increase and will encourage your partner to kiss you. None of you should feel shy holding hands since even three year olds can do it.
 Yes, you will both succeed on putting your timidity aside for awhile..but only for awhile. Your partner will get his face closer to yours and you should do the same. Your lips will obviously meet and by then you will start kissing, however, make the kiss only last for a short time and include only half of your feelings in it. After the kiss is over, your partner and you will be more excited to do it again which will make both of your timidity disappear making the kiss more passionate.

 Prior to its first use, a new badger shaving brush should be washed gently but thoroughly, using warm soapy water.


Be prepared for some hairs to come loose. When you get a new brush, it is quite natural for a few loose hairs to come away from the brush in the first few weeksâ€“these are shorter hairs that did not quite reach the glue base and this should not be a cause for concern.
 Place the shaving brush in its holder with the bristles facing down. Before storing, it is always important to allow the shaving brush to dry thoroughly, as leaving it wet and damp can damage the bristles. As shown in the image, run your clean thumb across the brush to check that it is dry.

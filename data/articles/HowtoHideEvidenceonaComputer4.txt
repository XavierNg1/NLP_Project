This means that your computer will erase all the free space and overwrite the date by adding 0's seven or 35 times making deleted files unrecoverable. 7 times is considered DOD (5220.22-M) sufficient and 35 times is considered impossible whatsoever. (Gutmann method). If the government seized your computer, and you used the Gutmann method before it was seized, given the time and proper equipment(which costs thousands of dollars), they would only be able to recover bits and pieces of the data but not the whole data itself. This includes CIA, FBI, National Security and other government agency that cannot fully restore the data.

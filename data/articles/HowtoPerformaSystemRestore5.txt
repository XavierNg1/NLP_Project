 Press ⊞ Win+S to open the search box and type control panel in the text field. When you see Control Panel come up in the search results, select it.
 Click “System and Maintenance,” then choose “Backup and Restore.”


If your computer picks up a really nasty virus or has another problem so you can’t use the automatic restore points, booting from a pre-made system repair disk can still save you. You must create the disk while your computer is stable and working for this method to be effective.
 You will need one or more writable CDs or DVDs for this process.
 When the discs have finished burning, eject them and put them somewhere safe. It may benefit you to create new system repair disks periodically, so you can be sure you have the most recent safe configuration to load.

 You know a lot about the point, plane and space, and they're not even defined in the study of geometry, but they are described as they are used.


What is a circle? The following information needs to form part of your (basic) understanding of things about circles, but one can learn a lot more as you go along.

equidistant - is short for "of equal distance"

circle - all the points equidistant, from the center (center point).
The following facts relate to but are not part of the circle:


center - the point equidistant from any point of the circle,

radius - the segment (names the length) between one endpoint at the center and the other end on the circle (it's that "equal distance" mentioned),

diameter - the segment (names the length) through the center and between its two endpoints on the circle,

segment, area, sector, and included or inscribed shapes within, but not part of, the circle, and

circumference - the distance one time around the circle.

Yeah, that word is long and odd; so, think of "the distance around circular-fence."

Ask for 2 or 3 thick steaks from your local meat counter. The salmon should be at least 3/4-inch (1.9 cm) thick in order to be properly stuffed. The length should be about the size of your hand. If you purchase 1 large steak, you can cut it in half to produce 2 proportional serving sizes.;

Dump your crab meat into a large bowl.
Sauté a small onion and half of a bell pepper in butter on the stove until the vegetables are tender. Place these into the bowl.
Whisk 1 egg in a separate bowl. Add mustard and whip to combine it with the egg. Add this to the crab meat bowl.
Grate approximately 4 tbsp (56.7 g) of frozen Brie into the bowl.
Toss in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (14.3 g) of pine nuts.
Set the stuffing mixture into the refrigerator until the salmon is ready.



Place the steaks on a cutting board. Insert a sharp knife into one side of the salmon steak. Stop when you are about two-thirds of the way inside.
Cut away a small square of salmon by gently running the knife along the interior. The size of the square you should cut depends on the amount of crab you want in each steak.



Spread extra virgin olive oil over both the flesh and skin sides of the salmon.
Rub salt and pepper onto the flesh side.



Spoon the stuffing into the pocket of the salmon. Use as much or as little as you prefer.



Preheat the oven to 435 degrees Fahrenheit (218.3 degrees Celsius) and grease a baking sheet with extra virgin olive.
Set each steak onto the baking sheet with the skin side facing upward.
Bake the salmon for 8 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the steaks. The meat is done when the steaks have turned an opaque pink hue.
Flip the salmon and grate the rest of the Brie on top. Place in the broiler until the cheese browns, about 4 minutes.

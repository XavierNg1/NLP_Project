 When you mark an email for deletion, it is typically sent to your Trash folder for a few days before it is permanently deleted. Different email services keep messages in the Trash for differing amounts of time, but emails may sit there for up to 30 days.


If you are using Outlook.com, click the Deleted option in the left menu, and then click the "recover deleted messages" link at the bottom of the page. Outlook will attempt to retrieve as many deleted emails as possible.;
, If your inbox is crowded, There's a good chance that the email you are looking for has simply been lost in the shuffle. You can use your email service's Search function to look for the email you want, or sort your inbox by date received and then browse for the day that you received the email.


You can try searching by the subject of the email, the sender's address, or keywords in the message itself.
 Many services allow you to reorganize your mail by placing them in folders or filing them under custom labels. It is not uncommon for people to forget that certain messages have been filed away, so go through your folders to ensure that you didn't accidentally file it somewhere it shouldn't be.
 Gmail archives messages instead of deleting them (unless you specifically choose "Delete"). This means that the message is removed from your inbox but kept on your account to be retrieved later. You can access archived messages by searching for them or by clicking the "All Mail" option in the left menu.
 If you have deleted a message from your web-based email account and it is no longer in your Trash, it is usually no longer retrievable. You can try contacting your email service provider, but chances are that the message is gone for good.

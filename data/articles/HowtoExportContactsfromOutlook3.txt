 Select "Import and Export". This will launch the Import and Export wizard.
 In the list of options, Select “Export to a file” to save your contacts in a file that you can open with another program.
 If you are exporting to another version of Outlook, select Outlook Data File. If you are exporting to a different program, select Comma Separated Values. Click the Next button to continue.
 Outlook lets you export any folder to a file, so you’ll need to select the Contacts folder, and then click Next.
 Click the Browse button to specify where you want to save your exported file. Provide a descriptive name and click the Next button a final time.
 Your contacts are now in a file ready to be imported.

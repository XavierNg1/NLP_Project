 Open the Books tab menu from the top of your Kindle Carousel. Find the book and hold your finger onto the book on the screen until the book where you add and remove the book from the device opens up. Tab the Remove button, and tab From Device. Wait for the book's checkmark to come off of the book you'd like to re-add to the Carousel.
 Tap without holding on the book. You'll see the scrollbar fill with a color - sometimes it's orange, sometimes it's green (color doesn't matter).
, The little icon that looks like a house at the bottom of the screen will take you directly back to your home screen.
 You're book should now be waiting for you on your Kindle Carousel.

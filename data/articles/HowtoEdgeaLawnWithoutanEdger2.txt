 You can edge the turf of your lawn using a square-edged spade. It’s best to apply pressure using your foot, so make sure you are wearing solid-sole shoes or boots when doing this.


You should only attempt to edge turf when the ground is fairly moist as it will be easier to cut through than dry earth.
Avoid edging your beds in winter when the ground is likely to be frozen hard and difficult to work.
 Before you begin, mark out where you want to make the new edge of the lawn. Stick the square spade in the ground to a depth of about 2 inches (5.1 cm).


Put the blade into the ground and put your foot on it, holding the handle firmly. Push down with your foot to cut through the soil. Try rocking gently to cut through the turf.
Push the handle forward and back slightly to loosen the cut edge away from the rest of the turf. It’s helpful to prise the cut area open slightly so you can see where you’ve worked.
Now move the spade’s blade a few inches to the side and cut the next piece away. Continue until you have edged the entire bed.
 You can also use a round-edged or pointed shovel – or even a hoe. This will make it easier to cut through the earth but the effect won’t be as neat. A spade with a flat square blade is better than a curved or pointed tool or hoe.

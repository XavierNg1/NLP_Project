, Visualize yourself in a place that brings up feelings of calmness and serenity.
 Inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Do this slowly, taking at least a second for both inhaling and exhaling. Do this multiple times at a constant tempo until you feel relatively calm.
 On the exhale, look down and open your eyes slowly (all of this is at the same tempo that you have been breathing at).
 You are now in Alpha state, a highly focused state in which your brain is willing to focus on whatever you choose to do. The real implications of this are that whatever you choose to do next will be much easier to focus on, and you won't be distracted as easily.


Keep in mind that the Alpha state is very close to the Theta and Delta states (the brain states that you have when you sleep), so you must do this while you are awake and sitting up so that you don't fall asleep.
If you want to go back into beta state (the default state of the brain when you are awake), just try to shake it out, walk around and you will revert back.

 Staying warm and cozy means burning more calories. You can stay happy and healthy during the winter by eating hearty stews and warm chilis. If your belly is nice and full of good warm stuff, you are less likely to be affected by cabin fever., Add some vitamin D to your diet by eating fish, mushroom, fortified milk, or taking supplements. Also, look for the sun anywhere you can! Sit in front of a window or bundle up and head out onto your porch for a few minutes. If you live in a region with very little natural sunlight, consider investing in a sunlamp., Lack of sunlight can cause us to crave high-sugar foods. Give yourself a sweet sugar boost in a healthy way to help keep cabin fever away. Try dark chocolate covered cherries, dried mangoes, or carrots roasted with a little honey to satisfy your sugar cravings and boost your mood., Watching a movie or a few episodes of a TV show can be a great way to pass the time indoors. But spending the whole day (or night) binge watching, is likely to contribute to feelings of listlessness and depression, inviting cabin fever in to stay. Limit yourself to an hour or two of TV time each day, or less., When there is nothing much to do, people have a tendency to stuff themselves full of high-carb, high-calorie foods. While snacking can be fun and uplifting, overdoing it will make you feel heavy, and put you in a bad mood. Exercise some portion control when snacking. Endlessly eating in front of the TV actually encourages feelings of cabin fever., Doing anything that stimulates your cognitive capacities is wonderful for banishing cabin fever. Try doing a crossword puzzle, Sudoku, or just reading a book. If you can do this activity while sitting in front of a window, even better!

 Use warm water and work up a good lather.


This facial works best with a lathering facial cleanser because the lather helps hold the sugar on your skin.;
, You can use whichever sugar you like. Some people recommend using brown sugar as it’s softer and gentler to your skin.You can also use coarser, granulated sugar if you prefer. It’s really a matter of personal preference.
 Using gentle circular motions with your fingers, work the sugar into the lather. Go over your entire face, but avoid your lips and eyes.


Don’t use a washcloth to rub the sugar into your skin, as this will be too harsh of an exfoliant and may irritate your skin.
 The sugar will do its work even with gentle pressure, so resist the urge to press down hard as you spread it over your skin.


It’s important to be gentle so that you don’t cause any microscopic tears on your skin’s surface, which could lead to breakouts or just generally less healthy-looking skin.
 If the lather dies down, add a bit of water. Just don’t add too much, or the sugar will dissolve.
 Once your face is covered and the sugar is firmly set in the lather, let the mixture sink into your skin for 15 to 20 minutes.


Try not to move around too much during this time, as the sugar will be more likely to fall off and you’ll reduce the benefits of the mask. It’ll also make your house messy, with little crumbs of sugar everywhere.
 After 15 to 20 minutes, rinse the mask off with cool water. The cool water will help close your pores and seal in moisture.
 Be gentle as you pat your face dry. If you scrub your face with the towel, you may cause skin irritation, including breakouts.
 Give your skin a final treat by massaging your favorite moisturizer into your face and neck.

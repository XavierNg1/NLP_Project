 If you do not already own one, you will likely need an acetylene torch for this method as it requires the application of constant, high heat., Crank down the vice so that the tube cannot move; however, do not apply so much pressure that you crush the tube.


Some vices have specific slots for rounded pipe or tube. This is preferable but not necessary.
 With the acetylene torch, you will need to apply constant, even heat to the area around where you need to bend. Make sure that apply the heat to the entire cylinder (or square) of the tube and not just the side where you need to bend it.The additional malleability will help the tube bend evenly instead of just buckling in one spot.
 Do not yank at the tubing. Instead apply a slow, firm force that increases gradually.You can apply the force with a wrench, a larger piece of tube over one end used as a pry bar, or by hand. However, the tube will be extremely hot, so use thick gloves rated for heat.
This step may require assistance so that one person can apply force to the tube while the other continues heating.
Packing the tubing with a non-combustible material such as sand before applying heat will help the tube bend without buckling or kinking.
 One of the easier ways of measuring your bend with this method is to make a template of the bend and cut it from another material, such as a scrap piece of plywood. As the angle increases, remove heat long enough to hold the template against the bend and increase incrementally and accordingly.

Draw a bean-shaped elongated oval for the body.
Make sure that you are using a pencil for the draft sketch so you can erase it afterwards to make it neat.



One oval should be bigger and longer and should point slanted upward. This is the wolf’s neck and head.
The other oval should be drawn on the other end of the body. A long, thinner, vertical oval will be added for the tail.



Just beside the tail and at the base of the slanted oval, add two circles for the leg joint.
For the muzzle, add a smaller oval pointing in the same direction as the neck/head oval.
Add a tear-shaped figure below the muzzle this would be the jaw.



Because of the angle, only one ear is visible. And to draw this, just draw a small rounded triangle pointing the opposite direction as the muzzle.
Add the legs by drawing lines below the leg joints. The hind leg should bend towards the tail.



Add similar lines to define the width of the wolf legs. The bottom part of the legs should look flat into the ground.
Add another pair of legs behind the ones you drew before. Because they are only slightly visible from the view, just draw a small part of them, peeking behind the legs

,


Add 2 pairs of circles at the end of the flat base of the legs.
You should have the basic drawing skeleton now.



Put in mind the overlapping lines and parts that should be hidden.
Remember to use fuzzy-looking crooked lines to get the wolf’s furry look.
The line art might not look perfect and crisp but it should look neat when the pencil is erased.



You can add details like the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, paws, claws and fur.
You can also add extra lines to emphasize the paw and the fur.



Depending on the breed, wolves can go in different shades from gray to brown or even white.

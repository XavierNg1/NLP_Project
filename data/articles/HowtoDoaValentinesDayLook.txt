 You don't want to go out feeling or looking gross! Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and pat dry. Then apply a light face moisturizer.;
, Maybe that means putting on that special vanilla scented body cream you love or shaving your legs. Make sure you smell nice by putting on a small amount of your sweet smelling perfume and perhaps a bit of body shimmer to give you a radiant look!

, Apply a light foundation or a BB cream all over your face. You want a medium coverage you don't want to look cakey. Apply sparsely on the middle of your face and on the spots you need it most and blend away until there are no streaky lines. Apply to your dark circles too if you have them.
 Move on to your eyes. Apply a light dusting of your favourite eyeshadow to your lids; baby pink is a great Valentine's themed color. Then take a darker shade of pink and apply to your crease blending it out. Take a plum colour and apply just into your outer corners and on your lower lash line smoking the look out.
 You don't the gold to be opaque; you just want to be able to see the pretty shimmer. Take a matte white and apply it to your inner corners and on your brow bone. Apply a black eyeliner and wing it out. Curl your lashes and apply a volumizing mascara.
 Great, now your eyes are done! Use a pink blush and apply to your cheeks for a rosy glow! Apply your highlighter to your cheek bones, forehead and nose. Apply bronzer if desired.
 The most important part! Apply a pink lipliner then lipstick to help make it last longer. The blot your lips and repeat. Once you've finished take out your trusty ol' gloss and swipe a thin layer on your lips. Your date doesn't want to be drowning in gloss!

, Wear that with some heels and maybe some cute accessories.
 Go out and party with your girls or meet with that special someone! Remember to be confident because you are beautiful!

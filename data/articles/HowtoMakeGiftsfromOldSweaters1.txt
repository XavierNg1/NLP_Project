 Keep the style of the person that you are giving the mittens to in mind. Almost any sized sweater, from small to large, will work for this project.
 Run a pencil around the edge of your thumb, fingers and wrist, leaving extra room for someone with bigger hands. Add 1/2-inch (1.3 cm) to the edge of the sweater pattern for your seams, or up to 1 inch (2.54 cm) for a bulky sweater., Cut through both layers of fabric, front and back, to form the 2 sides of your first mitten.

Make sure to leave enough space in the body of the sweater to make the second mitten.
 You will turn them inside out later on. Pin the 2 mittens together., Start at the bottom cuff and sew around the edges, leaving 1/4-inch (0.6 cm) of a seam allowance., This will prevent fraying. Make sure not to sew the bottom of the cuff., Repeat the same procedure to complete the second mitten.

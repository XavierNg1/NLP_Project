 Before you do anything, it is important to take a moment to calm down. Disciplining your child when you are noticeably angry can frighten a child so much that the child may not understand why he or she is being punished. Take a couple of deep breaths to relax before you talk to your child., Effective discipline should teach your child something that will cause your child to say or do something different in the future. For example, you might want to teach your child that it is not okay throw food. Take a moment to identify the lesson that you would like your child to learn., If your child is angry, sad, or experiencing some other negative emotion, then connecting with your child may help you to get through to him or her. Try kneeling down so that you can make eye contact with your child or try putting your arm around your child. Then, ask your child what he or she is feeling.


For example, you could say something like, “I can tell that something is wrong. Do you want to tell me how you are feeling?”

, Redirecting can help to make your child feel better and show them what is appropriate for the situation. For example, if your child is upset because he or she wants to stay up later than usual on a school night, then you might say something like, “We can stay up late this weekend and watch a movie together, but right now you need to get some rest.”, Empathy is a valuable trait for adults and children to have. By teaching your child empathy, you may find it easier to get him or her to behave.For example, if your child takes a toy away from another child, then you might ask your child something like, “How would you feel if Billy had taken your favorite toy?” By reframing your child’s behavior in this way, you can help your child to identify and think about how their actions can hurt others.

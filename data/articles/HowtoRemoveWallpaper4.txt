 Putting holes in the paper will help your stripping solution to penetrate the adhesive.


Some people skip the scoring process because it can create small holes in the paper on the drywall. If you have a real plaster wall, this isn't as much of an issue.
If you don't want to score your wallpaper, use 120-grit sandpaper with a vibrating sander. Sand just enough to take some of the color off.
 Make sure it's as hot as you can stand. Mix in a wallpaper-stripping solution according to the instructions on the bottle.


A vinegar solution would also effective, cheap, and non-toxic. Consider using a 20-percent solution, but if you’d feel more comfortable with a milder concentration, feel free to experiment.
Another cheap alternative is fabric softener at about 25- to 50-percent solution. It doesn't have to be fancy fabric softener, but do make sure it’s unscented.
Mixing your stripping solution in small batches will keep the water hot.
 A sponge or large paint brush also works well.


A spray bottle can make the solution much easier to apply but will also cool it down faster. Weigh your options.
 Don’t saturate more than you think you can strip in 10 to 15 minutes.
 This will give the solution time to do its job.
 With the help of a plastic putty knife, peel pieces of wallpaper away one at a time.


Peel upwards. This will make it easier to wedge the putty knife between the uplifted paper and the wall.
 Clean with soap and hot water, rinse, and then dry with a clean towel or rag.

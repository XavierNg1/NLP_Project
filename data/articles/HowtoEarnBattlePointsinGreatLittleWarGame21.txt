 The mission name and objective will be displayed on the pre-game screen. Tap the “Play Game” button to begin.
 If it’s your first time to play the mission, you will find a star floating around somewhere on the map.
 Tap on a unit to use to get to the star. Use a unit that can reach the star quickly and safely.


Most times, the star will be floating somewhere near the vicinity of the enemy camps or another hard-to-reach area, so plan your moves accordingly.
 On your every turn, move the unit closer to the star until you reach it. Be wary of the enemies nearby. You don’t want to be taken out when you’re near the star.
 When you’re close enough, tap on the unit then tap on the star to have the unit move and get the star.


The star is worth 150 Battle Points. Once you get it, 150 Battle Points will be added to your total Battle Points.
You can only get this star one time per mission. If you’ve already gotten it previously, the star won’t be present anymore.
 Note, though, that you don’t need to complete the mission after getting the star to earn the 150 Battle Points. Even if you lose the mission, the Battle Points are yours.
 On the missions map, your total number of Battle Points is indicated on the upper right corner.

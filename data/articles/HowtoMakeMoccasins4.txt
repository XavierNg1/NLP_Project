 Take a piece of leather about three inches thick and long enough to cover the rim of the top of your moccasin.


Cut out the rectangle using scissors and proceed to snip the leather with your scissors into strips, leaving about one inch of solid, uncut leather on top. You can make each fringe the same size or alternate random widths.
Take the fringed leather piece and trace the solid part of the leather around the rim of the moccasin with the fringe facing outward. Be sure to have the two sides of the leather rectangle meet in the back of the shoe so that the fringe seam matches the heel seam.
Thread your Glover's needle with enough artificial sinew to stitch the entire rim of the moccasin. A piece as long as the distance from your fingers to your elbow will be more than enough.
Sew on the fringed piece of leather to the top rim of the moccasin, using whatever creative stitch you desire. You can also use a different type of thread such as colored silk to personalize your moccasins even further.
Repeat with the other moccasin.
 If you want to add beads of any color, shape, or size to your moccasins, the fringe is a perfect and simple place to add them. Simply thread the beads onto the ends of the fringe and tie a knot at the end to keep the beads from falling off.


If you want to be absolutely sure that your beads won't come off, you can add a bit of hot glue to the center of the knot to prevent it from unravelling.

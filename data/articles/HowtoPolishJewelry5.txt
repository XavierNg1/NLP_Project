 Do not use a commercial jewelry cleaner on costumer jewelry because the solution is usually too harsh. Instead, mix one drop of baby shampoo into one cup of water. Stir the mixture together with a spin or other utensil.


Donâ€™t put vinegar or any other acidic ingredient into the mixture.
 Dip a soft toothbrush or Q-Tip into the mixture. Gently scrub over the surface of the jewelry. Make sure to clean the hard-to-reach spots and small areas. You may want to use a toothbrush for the larger areas, and a Q-Tip for the smaller areas., After you are done scrubbing, rinse the solution off of the jewelry in cold water. Do not use warm water because it can loosen the glue. Make sure all of the mixture is rinsed off and then dry the jewelry with a towel or microfiber cloth., Use a hair dryer to make sure that the jewelry is completely dry. Any leftover moisture can cause rust. Make sure to use the cool setting. A warmer or hot setting can cause the piece to warp or glue to melt., Keep each piece of costume jewelry in its own zipper plastic bag. Be sure that all oxygen is removed from the bag before storing it. Keeping the jewelry from being exposed to oxygen will keep it shinier for longer between cleanings. You can also purchase a velvet-lined jewelry box that has a lid instead of using plastic bags. Or, you can store the plastic box inside of the jewelry box.

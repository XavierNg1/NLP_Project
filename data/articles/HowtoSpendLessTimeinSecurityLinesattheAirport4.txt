 If you are a U.S. citizen, speed up your time in airport lines by applying for a TSA pre-check membership, which allows you to go through security without removing shoes, belts, light jackets, or laptops. Apply online at https://www.tsa.gov/precheck, then make an appointment for an in-person background check at one of the hundreds of enrollment centers in the country. The 5 year membership costs $85 and is honored at over 180 U.S. airports.
 If you are a frequent international traveller, apply for Global Entry, a program for low risk travellers who wish to go through U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoints at a faster pace upon arrival in the country. Visit https://goes-app.cbp.dhs.gov/goes/jsp/login.jsp to create a Global Online Enrollment System account, then complete your application. A vigorous screening process will follow, including an in-person interview at a Global Entry enrollment center.


Visit the U.S. Customs and Border protection website at https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry/enrollment-centers to find an enrollment center near you.
A non-refundable $100 application fee applies, payable by credit card or through an electronic bank transfer.
 Visit your airlineâ€™s website to see if they have an app available that allows you to check in from home and sidestep the lineup. For instance, the United Airlines app (available for Apple, Android, and Windows Phone 8) allows travellers to check in up to 24 hours in advance of their flight.Some airlines (e.g. EasyJet) will allow you to check in up to 28 days in advance of your travel date.

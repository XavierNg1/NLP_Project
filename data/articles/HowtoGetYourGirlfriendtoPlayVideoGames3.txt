 Her joints and muscles might get tired during her first few sessions. Show her how you usually stretch out your hands, because if she equates video games with sore and stiff hands, she won't want to play any more.


You could also give her a hand massage to make her feel better.
 When she wants to do something else, don't make her continue to play or make her feel guilty.
 Tell her you had fun and you hope you can play together again sometime.

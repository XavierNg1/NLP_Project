 Mix up a gingerbread cookie dough that also uses sweet potato filling. Combine the filling with shredded coconut, chopped pecans, chopped dates, leaveners, and spices. The cookies with be sweet and a little chewy once you've baked them until they're golden brown.

You can top each cookie with a pecan half or a few mini marshmallows.
 Use the sweet potato casserole to make moist cupcakes. Just swap out the filling for cooked sweet potato and adjust the sugar according to your taste. Once you've baked and cooled your cupcakes, whip up a frosting made with marshmallow fluff.You can also make an optional graham cracker crust for the cupcakes, if you'd like a little crunch.
 Give sweet potato casserole a second life by scooping the filling into a mixing bowl and combining it with eggs, milk, sugar, and spices. Pour this pie filling into an unbaked pie shell. Bake the pie until the center no longer jiggles.Serve the pie with whipped cream and candied pecans.

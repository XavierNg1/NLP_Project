 Your baby cannot bite when they are properly latched. When in position to feed, gently touch your nipple to your baby’s bottom lip to encourage them to open wide. You can also gently lower their chin to prompt them to open their mouth. Allow them to take your whole nipple and much of the areola in their mouth.When your baby is latched properly you shouldn’t get a pinching feeling on your nipple. Rather you should experience a slight pulling feeling on your breast.;
, Some babies who bite while nursing cannot concentrate on eating when there are various things to look at or listen to in the room. Go to a dark, quiet room so that the baby can focus on eating, rather than biting out of excitement or anxiety., Some babies bite to get their mother's attention as they nurse. Avoid biting by talking to your baby while feeding, touching them, and making lots of eye contact., Sometimes a baby will bite if they are sick and their nose is congested, because it’s hard for them to breathe. Clear your baby’s nose with a bulb syringe before nursing to minimize likelihood of biting.

 If you are meditating in a class or group environment, your clothing should be on the modest side. Avoid any low cut tops or tops with loose necklines or collars. Make sure your top is long enough to cover your torso no matter what position you are in.In a group setting, your clothing should not be a distraction to the other people that you are around either.
 If you layer your clothing, you will can be comfortable in any environment. You may be cold at the beginning of your mediation but warm up as you go along. You may be in a studio or gym that blasts the air conditioning. Keep a light jacket, hoodie, or shawl with you. If you have to be barefoot, bring some socks in case your feet get cold.Cotton and silk are breathable fabrics that are good for layering.
 Many people meditate at religious temples or meditation centers. These places often have dress codes that you must follow. Call the location or check their website before you go meditate. You do not want to be turned away because your outfit is not appropriate.


Common limitations include no shorts, tank tops, tight fitting clothes, or shoes. You may also have to wear clothes that cover your knees.

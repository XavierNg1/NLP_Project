 It is important to consume a well-balanced diet during pregnancy, not just to help your baby grow as well as possible, but also because nutritional deficiencies can contribute to sore muscles.


It is important to eat foods rich in magnesium, as it is a crucial mineral to combat muscle soreness. Eating foods rich in magnesium, such as pumpkin seeds, boiled spinach, Chinook salmon, Swiss chard, sesame seeds, or broccoli, can be helpful for sore muscles.
Foods rich in calcium can also help, as calcium works in concert with magnesium to help with muscle function. Calcium is found in many dairy products, or you can take an over-the-counter supplement if that is easier for you.
It is also advisable to take vitamin B6 and B12 supplements during pregnancy, particularly if you have sore muscles.
 Protein is necessary to repair and rebuild your muscles. For pregnant women, the ideal daily protein intake is at least 70 grams.Include at least one food rich in protein in each major meal.


Good sources of protein are lean meat, beans, shellfish, eggs, milk, cheese, yogurt and tofu.
 Another reason why you might have muscle soreness during pregnancy is because of dehydration. You may not feel thirsty, but your muscles may need more water to function properly; therefore, make it a habit to drink lots of water during your entire pregnancy.


Try setting up an alarm every hour and drinking a glass of water.

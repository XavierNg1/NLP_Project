 The polite way of greeting somebody you have just been introduced to is to say, "Good evening, Jessi. It is nice to meet you."


Offer to shake their hand, and when accepted, use a firm but not crushing grip.
Ask, "How are you?" This helps break the ice, and gives them an opportunity to greet you as well. Just remember that invariably, when asked how they are doing, people will say "fine" no matter what's going on in their lives for real. Be prepared to move on to the next topic. Notice something about them, what they're wearing, or if your host has indicated what your new acquaintance does, talk about that.
 To continue the conversation, you can also make small talk about the weather, family, how far you traveled, where a good spot for lunch might be, and other topics of general interest. Don't try to impress. Simply be affable, personable, and approachable. Keep it simple.
 If the person you are talking to is constantly looking over their shoulder, or checking their watch, it's a pretty good sign they're not interested in the conversation. Gracefully excuse yourself, and go refresh your drink.

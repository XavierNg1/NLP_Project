 It's going to look a whole lot better when you've finished with it!


Choose a frame according to the size of the image you'd like to place inside, or just a frame size that you like.;
, If you do want to change it, use a paint suitable for wood and paint the frame. One color is easiest, although you could vary by having one color for the long sides and another matching color for the top and base sides. Red and green or silver or gold are good colors. If you do paint it, let it dry completely before proceeding.
 Paint a light layer of glue onto the frame and sprinkle glitter onto the glue. Allow to dry for at least quarter of an hour, or as long as the manufacturer's instructions suggest.


Match the glitter to the frame or paint color. Christmas colors include red, green, metallic, white, etc.
 Glue something else to the frame to finish it off. Some examples include:


Artificial mistletoe in each corner of the frame.
A red and green ribbon bow on the top center of the frame.
Use Christmas themed buttons, plastic models, cut-outs, etc. and attach them wherever you think they look best on the frame.
 The frame is now ready for display or to give as a gift.

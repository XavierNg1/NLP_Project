 Shy people are often overwhelmed with too much socialization and a fast-paced relationship. Start off with talking to her a few days a week and then slowly add days over the next couple of weeks. Also, increase the amount of time that you spend together. Slowly add time to your phone conversations or face-to-face meetings., Once you find a subject that interests both of you, find more ways to bring that subject into your conversations. Research the subject so that you have new and interesting things to talk about., Most shy people are introverts, and introverts thrive by having alone time. If she asks to be alone, that does not mean that she is mad at you. Give her the space that she needs so that she feel rejuvenated and more able to socialize.

 Craigslist.org is free and there are other sites or writing communities where you can post your ad for a nominal fee.;
, Be personable. Visualize yourself telling the writer who you are and why you're writing a book. You don't have to use sensitive information, just a first name and a quick bio will do.
 In 1-2 sentences, tell the writer what kind of book it is (memoir, autobiography, how-to, romance thriller), what genre it is (fiction, non-fiction), and who you're writing it for (teenage girls, men over 35, dessert-lovers,etc).
 Research and decide whether you want to self-publish or publish traditionally. It is good for the writer to know regarding your financial arrangements.
 If you don't have one, check out other articles on how to publish a book to get an idea of how much investment writing and publishing a book will require.
 Doing this can filter out unqualified writers to save yourself time. For example, you may have requirements based on location, gender, topic familiarity, and so on. Be clear about these upfront.
 The time it takes to write a book varies. An informational e-book can take 1-3 months where a full-length novel can take 6-12 months or more.
 Have you already written an outline? Do you have material in blogs, websites or journals that you want to use? Or is it all inside your head still? This will determine the feasibility of the time frame and help you figure out potential methods for working together.
 Remember, ghostwriters are solely writers. If you need editing, cover design, formatting or someone to upload your book onto Kindle, those are separate job descriptions, and you may have to seek out people who specialize in them.
 If you're using Craigslist, make sure to avoid spammers by requiring applicants to put a specific headline in the e-mail, like "Rolling Red Thunder," to distinguish who's who in your email inbox.

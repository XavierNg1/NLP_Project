 It doesn't matter how long you make the strings - just make sure they are all the same length in each round.Â 


The longer you cut the strings each round, the longer they will last you and you will not have to cut new strings as often if you have more each time.;
, Clip the part that plugs into the device first.
 Tie your strings all together in a knot just below the plug. Coat the knot well with nail polish and let it dry well.
 Do this until you have only about 5 inches of string left. If you don't know how to make forward knots, look up a tutorial in the above search bar.
 Again, cut some string (preferably long strands). Tie this string onto the headphones like you did at the beginning, only tie it on top of your leftover strings as well. Coat the knot in nail polish and let it dry. Then, cut off the leftover string from last round.
 Make a knot and coat the knot with nail polish. Let it dry.
 Do the same, only here, for both of these, I normally use only one colour.
 Make forward knots, change the strings and coat the knots until the string reaches the earbuds.
 Make sure all of the knots are coated and secure, and that they are all dry.
 You can now use your headphones. It may have seemed a bit hard and time-taking...but remember, every time you do this it gets easier and easier!

 Cut the bottle into two pieces 2-3 inches above the bottom . Discard the bottom and keep the cap on the top.


While box cutters usually cut the best, a serrated bread knife works well too.;
, These will allow water into the trap. Using either the tip of a knife or a hot nail (heat will cause the plastic to melt), put a few 1 centimeter holes around the middle of the bottle.
 Simply run your string or fishing line through two holes, then tie a knot between the two ends to make a simple handle. This will make it easier to remove the trap later.
 Cut just below the point where the top meets the "body" of the bottle. You will be left with a a cylinder and a tapered top section. Keep the top and discard the cap and the bottom cylinder.
 This is the entrance for the minnows -- they are funneled into the hole by the tapered top and then trapped inside the body of the other bottle.
 You can also punch holes in both bottles with a hot nail -- this will melt the plastic together.
 This is your bait. One inch pieces should be big enough. You can also put some sand, dirt, or rocks in the trap to help it sink and keep it from floating away.
 Minnows tend to swarm in shallow, slow moving pools of water. You can often see them from the shore, so put your trap somewhere you will get plenty of "bites."


Push the trap lightly underwater so it fills up and sinks.
 The fish will be funneled into the trap, but are unable to find their way back through the small hole made with the top of the bottle. You can unscrew the bottom of your trap to get the minnows out, then screw it back up to use again.

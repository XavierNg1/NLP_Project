 Get rid of temptation by deleting any one-click links and icons that you have on your computer and mobile devices. Force yourself to start typing each letter in the web address whenever temptation strikes. Give yourself more time to reconsider visiting the site before you get there.

Since YouTube is a pretty popular site, the autofill feature in browsers will likely suggest it after the first couple of letters. Make a point of filling in the whole address on your own. Always give yourself more time to back out.;
, True, you can still watch YouTube without being logged into a personal account, but delete your account anyway. Rid yourself of all the channels that you’ve curated over time. Force yourself to spend more time searching for videos if temptation leads you back there. This way you have more time to reconsider what you’re doing. To deactivate your account:Open the Account link in the YouTube menu.
Select “Delete Account.”
Type in why you’re closing the account when prompted.
Type in your password.
Click “Delete My Account.”

, If you find yourself succumbing to temptation again and again, prevent yourself from being able to visit the site at all. Open the settings to your Internet browser, search for its blocking features, and add YouTube to the list. If needed, download the appropriate add-on for your browser if it doesn’t allow blocking as part of its original features.Internet Explorer and Opera should allow you to block sites without needing to download any add-ons.
Firefox may require you to download the add-on LeechBlock.
Chrome may require you to do the same with StayFocused.

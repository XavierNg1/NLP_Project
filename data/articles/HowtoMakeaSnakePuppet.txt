,







Alternate "short" and "long" egg halves







Here is the final body:

Tie off the last bead by tying the string to itself. Loop the string through the last bead once more for strength, and tie if off again. Trim the remaining string.



To create rod A, drill a hole 1" (2.5cm) from each end of the dowel.







To create rod B, drill a hole 1" (2.5cm) from each end as well as a third hole 1/2" (1.2cm) from one end.







Sand the splinters off with sandpaper, if necessary.
 Make sure to position control rod B near the head, with the end with 2 holes nearest the head.
 Tie one end to the spinal string where the first hole in rod A lines up.
 Tie the first body string off.








Before tying off the 2nd string, hold up the control and puppet to make sure that the 2nd string is the same length as the first. Tie the 2nd string to the control.







Repeat the process for the next two body strings and control rod B. Hold up the puppet every time to test the string length.







Be sure to connect the front-most body string to the inner hole of the front of rod B.
 Stick the eye onto the front of the head. Repeat for the other eye.



Make sure the eyes are between the holes drilled in step 3.
 Thread it through the head holes drilled in step 3. Snap the front of the head to the back to make a whole egg.
 Adjust the length so that the head hangs as desired.
 Make sure that the head is level while holding the control rod.

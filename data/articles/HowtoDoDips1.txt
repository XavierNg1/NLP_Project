 Most gyms with extensive weight sections will have this piece of equipment. It has a platform where you place your knees or feet and weights that can be adjusted to counterbalance your body weight.

Make sure the weight is locked into place before getting onto the platform. Weight machine vary greatly in operation.
 The handles are usually covered in rubber for traction. Wrap your fingers around the outside and keep your thumbs on the inside.


Your wrists will need to be at a slight angle behind you to allow your elbows to bend backwards. Try to keep your wrists in line with your forearms to avoid wrist injury.
 If the platform is on the ground, rather than at knee height, it is likely a standing platform.
 Imagine you are doing a pushup and you have one straight line from the top of your head to the knees. Lift and flex your stomach muscles inward to keep this strong position during the duration of the exercise.


You will move straight up and down, as if you are sliding up and down a wall. Donâ€™t lean forward as you complete a dip.
 They should be as far from your ears as possible. Your hands should be directly below your shoulders.
 As you do this, the platform will lower slightly. Bend them until your elbows are parallel with your shoulders, at a 90 degree angle from your forearms.Inhale as you dip down.

Exhale as you lift your body up.
Give your body a day to rest between arm strength training days.
 Reduce the amount of weight by 5 to 10 lbs. as the exercise gets easier. When the amount of weight you use is one-half or less of your body weight, you can move on to bench dips.

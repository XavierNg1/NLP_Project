, When the brakes are not applied, they should be about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the wheel rim, and when the lever is squeezed, they should make full contact at about half the distance the lever will travel.
 You may use a lubricant in an aerosol can with a tube to spray oil into the cable housing at the ferrell where the cable enters the housing underneath the brake levers. A light machine oil with a small nozzle similar to "3 in 1" Oil, or a special brake cable oil purchased at a bike shop is recommended. WD-40, and similar products may "wash" the factory lubricant off the cable, and when they evaporate, there will be very little lubricant residue on the cable.
 This is done by removing the clamp at either the caliper or brake lever, and pulling it out the opposite end. If you remove the cable, use an aerosol solvent (or even WD-40) to flush any dirt or debris from the cable tube while the cable is out. Apply a light coat of lithium grease or machine oil to the cable, and reinstall it if it is not damaged.
 When the brake pads are about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the wheel with the lever released, tighten the clamp.
 Buy the same diameter cable, factory fitted, in the same length as the original equipment. Making up the ferrells, cutting the cables to the correct length, and threading cables cut with pliers through the clamps is a difficult chore.

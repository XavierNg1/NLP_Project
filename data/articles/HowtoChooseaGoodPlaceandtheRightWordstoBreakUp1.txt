 Breaking up prematurely will, 99.9% of the time, ruin a relationship. If there's a problem, try to find a way to solve it, and if you can't, you'll either have to deal with it or break up.;
, Common sense, right? Wrong. Breaking up over the phone is a sign of fear to some, and a sign of lying to some.
 If you're breaking up with someone who really likes you, of course they'll cry or get angry. Save yourself the embarrassment and try not to break up with your boyfriend/girlfriend in a place such as the movie theaters, the beach, a restaurant, etc.
 This just ruins the mood, and if it's a movie or restaurant, you're the one whose going to have to pay the bill. Definitely.
 So say your girlfriend/boyfriend crashes your car. Don't get angry and end it just because she/he wrecked your car. If you do, this screams that you don't care about any girl/guy you'll have, and it's extremely hard to get another girl/boy to trust you.
 This IS COMMON SENSE. Breaking up with someone when they're mad is just screaming "Give me what you got!" They just might end up taking out their anger on you.

Add the cinnamon, then stir until everything is evenly combined., Buy a pack of 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) flour tortillas. Brush the melted butter onto each tortilla.

You can also cut the tortillas smaller, if you'd prefer., Set the remaining chips aside for a later batch. You won't be able to fit everything on one baking sheet, so plan on baking the chips in batches., The chips are ready when they turn crispy. Once the chips are baked, slide them off onto a cooling rack, and bake the rest in another batch (or two)., Place the chips into a bowl, then set them down on the table alongside the fruit salsa.

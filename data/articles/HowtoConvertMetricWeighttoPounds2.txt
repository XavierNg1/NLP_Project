 The basic metric unit of weight is the gram. All other metric units of weight are equal to the gram multiplied by a power of ten, as described by the prefix. For example, "kilo-" means 1000, and a kilogram weighs exactly 1000 grams. "Milli" means "1/1000," so each milligram is one one-thousandth the weight of a gram (thus, 1000 milligrams = 1 gram).


1kilogram=1,000grams{\displaystyle 1kilogram=1,000grams}


1milligram=11000gram{\displaystyle 1milligram={\frac {1}{1000}}gram} = 0.001 grams

This article uses American notation, writing decimal marks with a period (.).
 Converting between metric units doesn't even require arithmetic. Instead, move the decimal point one place to the left to divide by 10, or one space to the right to multiply by 10. Here's an example:

To convert 450 grams into kilograms, first work out the conversion for a single gram: 1000 grams = 1 kg, so therefore 1 gram = 11000{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1000}}} kg → 1 gram = 0.001 kg.

The conversion from 1 gram to 0.001 kg involves moving the decimal place to the left three times (1 → 0.1 → 0.01 → 0.001).

Do the same to convert your measurement from grams to kilograms. Start with 450 grams, move the decimal to the left three times, and you get 0.45. Therefore 450 grams = 0.45 kg.
 Once you've got your measurement in kilograms, the process is the same as described in the section above. Simply multiply the kilograms by 2.2 to convert them into pounds. In the last example above, multiply 0.45 kg * 2.2 lb/kg = 0.99 lb. Here's another example to show you the whole process from start to finish:


Convert 3045 grams into pounds.

First, convert grams into kilograms:1 gram = 0.001 kg3045 g = 3.045 kg

Next, convert kilograms to pounds:1 kg = 2.2 lb3.045 kg * 2.2 lb/kg = 6.699 lb

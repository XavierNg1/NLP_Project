 A second type of skin infection is a streptococcal, or strep, infection. Strep infections include:


Impetigo — This is also known as “school sores.” This is a common skin infection that may cause blisters or sores. This commonly affects children.
Strep throat — Your throat may become sore and white dots might appear on your tonsils or the roof of your mouth.
Scarlet fever — You may experience a very high fever. You may also have a red rash with a sandpaper like texture. Your throat may be coated in a white mucous and you may experience swollen glands. Toxic Shock Syndrome — TSS may be caused by pregnancy, hospital stay, or extended tampon use. The symptoms include a sunburn-like rash, fever, and swollen glands. , Some strep infections are fairly common and are frequently passed around from patient to patient in the school or work environment. These common infections include strep throat and impetigo. Other strep bacteria, such as scarlet fever, are a bit rarer.
 Like a staph infection, a strep infection can occur anywhere in the body. Infections such as scarlet fever and strep throat may be more easily diagnosed by examining for discoloration or swelling in the throat or mouth. External rashes, sores, or scabs may be the sign of diseases such as cellulitis or toxic shock syndrome.
 Strep infections can be contagious and need to be treated immediately. Go to your doctor or dermatologist (if you can get an immediate appointment) if you think you have any of these diseases. These infections can be treated with antibiotics, and should be monitored closely by a healthcare professional.

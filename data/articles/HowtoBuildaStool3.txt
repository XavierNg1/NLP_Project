 You'll need a 12" concrete forming tube (about 2' high, usually sold in 4' lengths), quick set concrete, four 2" diameter dowels or four 2x2s cut to the height that you want your stool, duct tape, sandpaper, and dye if you want your concrete a different color.
 Use the duct tape to completely cover one end of your 2' tube. Make sure it is very secure and that there aren't any holes. Spray the tape and sides with cooking spray to keep the concrete from sticking.
 Mix and pour enough concrete to fill the tube to the halfway point. The dye, if you've decided to use some, should be mixed in when mixing the concrete.
 Tap and shake the tube side to side to release bubbles trapped in the concrete.
 Add the legs into the tube and set them at the angle that you want. You may be able to rest them on the edge of the bucket or you might have to tie a string around them to keep them at the angle and placement you want. The ends at the bottom of the tube should not, however, be at the edge. They should be at least 1-2" inwards from the edge.
 Let the concrete set according to the manufacturer's instructions. This is usually at least 2 hrs for this thickness.
 Once the concrete has set, you can cut away the tube and remove any tape that might be left over.
 You'll probably want to angle or round out the ends of the legs. You can also make the seat itself wider by gluing on a larger garden stone as a seat. Painting and staining the legs is another great finishing touch.

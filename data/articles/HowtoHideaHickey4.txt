 Applying ice or cold to your hickey in any form will help reduce the swelling. Here are some things to try:


A cold compress.
Ice in a zip-lock bag.
A cloth dipped in icy water.
A cold spoon. Moisten a spoon with water and put it in the fridge for five minutes.
In a pinch, grab a frozen item out of your freezer and hold it against your hickey.
 Leave it on for a while, then take a break, and apply the ice again. If you're feeling too much pain, put the ice away for a while.



Do not apply ice directly to the hickey. Make sure it is covered by a cloth, paper towel, or zip-lock bag.
If you're using a spoon, you should place it in the freezer every five minutes to keep it cool, or keep a few cold spoons in the freezer to speed up the process.

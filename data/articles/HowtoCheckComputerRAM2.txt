 This will open a small window with some basic information about your system.
 This will tell you how much memory you have installed, as well as the type and speed.
 Most Macs have two or more RAM slots, but you may not have sticks installed in all of them. The "Memory" tab will show how many slots you have on your computer and which slots are currently in use.
 This link will take you to Apple's guide to upgrading your Mac's memory. you can upgrade the memory on most Mac computers, except the Air line.
 The Activity Monitor will allow you to see how much RAM is being used and how much is available.Open the Applications folder and then open the Utilities folder.
Launch Activity Monitor and then click the "System Memory" tab.
"Memory Used" is how much RAM is currently being used. You'll need to subtract this from "Physical Memory" to see your available. As long as you're not experiencing performance problems, there's nothing to be concerned about all your memory being used.
 Sometimes your installed RAM may not be recognized by OS X. There are several things you can try to diagnose the problem:


Reseat your RAM. It's possible that a RAM stick has come loose and is no longer connected. Open up the RAM bay on your Mac and check the connections for all of the RAM sticks.
Run MemTest to test your installed RAM. If your RAM is failing it may not be reporting correctly in OS X. You can download MemTest for free from memtestosx.org.

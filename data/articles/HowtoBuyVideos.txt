 DVD stands for Digital Versatile/Video Disc. Videos in this format can be played in a DVD player, or on most newer computers via the DVD-ROM drive.


Purchase DVD videos at retail stores such as Best Buy or Walmart.
Use online sources like the aforementioned brands' websites, or at Amazon.com in order to purchase DVD videos.

Watch garage sales for even more videos to add to your collection. With the move to electronic file and Blu-ray players, many families are selling their old DVDs for a fraction of what you would pay had you purchased them from a retailer.;

 Applying darker shades can make certain features recede. To make your nose appear shorter, apply a little bronzer or eyeshadow to the tip of your nose, on the curve between your nostrils.









Make sure to use a matte bronzer or eyeshadow to do this, you don't want the tip of your nose to shimmer!
Blend the powder well using a soft blender brush or sponge.
 Apply highlighter to the bridge of the nose, stopping about halfway down. Applying highlighter only halfway down will give the illusion of a shorter nose.
 Make your nose appear shorter and thinner at the same time by applying shading down the sides of the nose, as well as on the tip. However, to avoid adding length, you should only begin the contour lines parallel to your tear ducts, rather than at the brow bone.

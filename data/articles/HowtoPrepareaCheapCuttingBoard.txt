 If your board has a juice trough, polish that as well - you do not want the surface of your board to collect food or snag your cloth when wiping the board down. Polish the back as well - even if you don't cut on it, polishing the back (and the edges) will make it easier to keep your board clean. If your board is very coarse/rough, start with a coarse wool - but finish the job with a very fine wool. When properly polished, the wood grain should be clearly visible, well defined, and the surface should reflect light evenly.;
,, Let it sit, and absorb the mineral oil into the board. Repeat this at least daily for at least a week before using your new board!

 Before you make reservations it’s best to decide on what restaurant you’d like to go to. Not every restaurant is willing to take reservations, even if they are consistently busy. For example, some smaller or newer restaurants may not have enough clientele yet to set up a system for reservations. So it’s important to know a restaurant’s policy before you try to book a table.;
, Once you’ve chosen a restaurant, figure out how many people are going to go to dinner with you. Depending on the size of your party, your wait time may vary. For example, if there are only two of you, you are more likely to have an easier time getting a table. On the other hand, if you are trying to book a table for a party of 10, it’s going to be much more difficult. The number of people in your party may also affect how far ahead you need to book your reservation.If you are unsure whether or not a person will be able to make it, book a table including them anyways. It’s easier to have an empty seat rather than trying to add a chair to a table in a crowded restaurant.
 Depending on the day of the week, there may be more openings than others. For example, reserving a table on a weekday is easier than trying to book a table over the weekend. Similarly, setting a reservation for “off-hours” rather than the regular “prime time” hours for breakfast, lunch, or dinner will make getting a reservation easier.


You should always have a backup date and time in case there is no availability at the original time you chose.

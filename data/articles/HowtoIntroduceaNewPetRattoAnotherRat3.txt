 If one of the rats was using it before, you need to make it like a completely new cage to him. Clean it out completely. Use disinfecting soap (a scent is helpful) and scorching hot water. Set it up with all new bedding and food. Everything should be either washed or new. If you had a wooden hiding hut, buy a new one. The cage should even look different. Put the litter box, shelves, and hammocks in different places. The cage should be totally new and clean, so that the rat you had in it before won't have his claim on it.
 Open the door of the cage and put them in at the same time, but leave the door open so that they can leave if they want to. One of them will probably have been showing the other rat that it's "in charge" by flipping the other on it's back and then letting it up. They are figuring out which one of them is the dominant rat. They might squeak little "ah" squeaks. But you don't need to separate them unless they are really fighting. They should be getting along well already at this point.
 It's a shared cage now. They are one pack now. In a few days you should start putting the rats together in their cage during the day, but at night have them in two separate cages. (or whenever you would best be able to monitor them and notice if there was a problem, have them together during that time.) This gets them used to living together, but they still have a break sometimes.
 Congratulations! Your rats are now best friends and living in the same cage! They should no longer feel threatened by the other rat. Make sure to give them both attention!

 Once the surface is clean, dry, and smooth, it’s ready to prime. Though combination paint and primer sprays exist for use on plastic surfaces, use a primer if you wish to paint your furniture in a color of paint that is not available for plastic materials. Choose a primer designed to be used on plastic materials that are stored outdoors.These will be available at your local home improvement store, and will come in a spray can. Shake the can and spray the entire surface you intend to paint.
Apply the primer in a steady back-and-forth motion while holding the can’s nozzle 12-18in (30-45cm) from the surface.
 Use a combination paint and primer designed for use on plastic or prime the surface with a plastic-specific primer first. A satin finish is recommended for plastic surfaces. Hold the can upright, with the nozzle 12 in (30cm) from the surface. Evenly spray the entire surface in sweeping, back-and-forth motions., Once the paint is dry to the touch, assess whether you need another coat. This is up to you. If you used a paint and primer combo, you’ll likely want to do at least one more coat. Once you’re happy with the paint coverage, let the piece dry for 24 hours before use. Don’t remove any painter’s tape until the piece is completely dry!

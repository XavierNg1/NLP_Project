 You can usually do this by checking your car’s specifications, whether on the internet or with a dealer. The more recent your vehicle, the more likely it is to have ABS brakes. If you’re really unsure, you can always check with a mechanic the next time you get your car serviced., Because ABS brakes do most of the work preventing your wheels from locking, they make it easier for you to steer when you need to brake on ice. Rather than keeping your hands fixed at the 10 and 2 positions, you should shuffle your hands so they always stay on their side of the steering wheel. This means that, even if you need to turn the steering wheel harshly, your arms never cross, giving you more control.

This is very similar to the grip many race car drivers use., While they do a great job of preventing your wheels from locking, ABS brakes don’t work as well on ice and snow as they do on pavement. As such, it’s important to react quickly, then let the system work. It’s crucial to stay alert and always keep your eyes on the road., With ABS brakes, you don’t have to worry about pumping the brakes or applying steady pressure. Just push the brake pedal hard. You might feel the pedal shudder and push back against your foot slightly. This is normal; the ABS is kicking in, relieving some of the pressure from the wheels to prevent them from locking. Don’t remove your foot or pump the brakes, let the system work., Sometimes braking isn’t enough, and you might need to steer away from a possible collision. If you need to steer, make smooth, precise movements. Jerking the steering wheel can cause your car to skid and slide. The wheels will lose their traction and you’ll lose control of your vehicle.

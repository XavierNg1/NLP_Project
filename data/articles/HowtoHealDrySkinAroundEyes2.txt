 When choosing foundation/concealer, look for one that says "hypoallergenic" on the label as this will minimize irritation and dryness to your skin. Also, when applying it to your skin, put as little as possible around your eyes, or avoid the eye area altogether.


When selecting eyeshadow, the powder form is better than the cream form. This is because it is easier to remove, and overall less irritating to the skin around your eyes. (And remember, irritation to the skin around the eyes is a leading cause in dryness.)

, Also, wash it off as soon as you are done with gentle cleansers that do not exacerbate dry skin. Mascara and eye-liner can cause undue stress (pulling and stretching) of the skin around the eyes, making them more prone to dryness and irritation.
 Choose creams that are specifically designed for sensitive and dry skin. One simple option is Vaseline jelly, as this is a non-irritating and very effective remedy that can be applied gently beneath your eyes before bed each night. That way, you can wash it off in the morning without anyone having to see it during the day. Another option is Kiehl's Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado, which has been reported to have very effective results in people seeking to heal dry skin around their eyes. Overall, any moisturizing cream that is hypoallergenic and that seems to work for you (by process of trial and error, as you will be able to tell quite quickly whether it is worsening or improving the dryness around your eyes) should do the trick. The important thing is to be proactive and to use a moisturizing cream of some sort.

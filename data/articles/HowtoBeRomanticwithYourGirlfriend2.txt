 You don’t need any specific reason to plan a romantic date. While Valentine’s Day and your anniversary are perfect times to have a romantic date, you should have some consistency more often. You need to make time. If the two of you work or travel on weekends, plan an extravagant and romantic date for a Tuesday night.


Rent a convertible and drive around.
Check local concerts and surprise her with a date night.
Cook her favorite meal and have it waiting for her when she gets home during the week.
 Making plans to see the game with your friends doesn’t count as a date. You need to make it so that it is only the two of you. This will put all of your attention on her.
 Spoil your girlfriend with random gifts. You don’t have to empty your bank account to do so, but every now and then surprise her with a new sweater she saw at the mall, a pair of earrings, or a new movie for the two of you to watch. Once again, it doesn’t have to be overly expensive—it’s more about the thought behind the gift.

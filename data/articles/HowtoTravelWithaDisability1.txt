 If you are planning extensive international travel, beware that some airlines do not allow some disabled passengers to travel without a companion. Disabled rights vary from country to country, so a companion can help you navigate new environments and help you in case of emergencies.


Consider hiring a travel nurse to accompany you on your trip, if you have serious medical concerns. You can find travel nurse networks online.;
, In order to receive disabled accommodations and access, you must disclose your disability at least 48 hours ahead of time. Internet or email booking does not always include an option to disclose your disability.
 Checkout books from the library, such as Lonely Planet travel guides, to get an idea of how accessible the area is. Sites like disabledtravelers.com and independenttraveler.com give advice on the best destinations for disabled travelers.
 Many travel providers are extremely busy, so you need to communicate what you need quickly and clearly. Carry a letter with you in case it needs to be translated and ask your companion to memorize and practice how to request disabled accommodations.
 The doctor will be able to tell you if there are any unforeseen travel or medication risks. Request all the medication you require, plus a few days extra in case of delays.
 Give a copy to all travel companions, so that they know who to contact in case of emergencies.
 Disabilitytravel.com, access-able.com, armchair.com/tour/hc/handcap, medicaltravel.org and worldonwheelz.com are specialty tour websites. You can choose a tour that is already set up to cater to your disability.

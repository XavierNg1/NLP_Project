 Your younger sibling won’t want to listen if you don’t have a good relationship with them. If you’re not used to talking with them, start opening up to them by asking them how their day went or if they learned anything new at school.


Listen, and allow them to talk about their problems.
A good way to build trust is to give them advice when they’ve done something wrong at school.
 Sometimes we don’t get along with our siblings but it’s important to know that your relationship with them later in life is often affected by events early in both your lives.The earlier that you start building a friendship with them, the more likely they’ll come to respect you.


You don’t need to let your younger sibling tag along all the time, but the more you do things with them, the more your friendship will grow.
The sibling bond is the longest lasting relationship most people will have their entire lives., Acknowledging your younger siblings emotions is important to develop a good relationship, even if you think that the topic is silly.Try to remember what it was like being their age, and try to relate to how they are feeling.


Don't simply say "it's against the rules." Explain to your brother or sister why the behavior is bad or dangerous.
Try to be more relatable by telling them your past experiences.

 Backlinks are when another website links to your page. It works in your favor if the website is one that gets more hits than yours does. The best types of "link building" are directory registration, text link advertising, and press release distribution, but you can also build links by doing a link exchange, cross promotion, or guest blogging for a relevant blog.


Try to offer valuable information or tools so that other people are motivated to link to your site. This will increase the chances of natural backlinks.
 Spamming comment sections and other website areas (read: anywhere on wikiHow!) will actually make Google and other search engines dock you severely or remove you entirely. Do not spam people to build backlinks for yourself. Search engines will also punish you if your name is attached to spamming complaints or if you operate your website anonymously.
 Right now, social media share and likes are the activity which is most rewarded by Google and other search engines. especially for subjects that are currently relevant. Create social media accounts with the major sites and update them regularly. Avoid being spammy by not just posting ads: post pictures of customers, events that you attend relating to your business, and other content that your fans might enjoy., Most search engines reward websites which see regular or at least recent updates.

 Bruising commonly happens to vegetables. This can happen when you place it in a bag to bring it home or in the refrigerator. Bruises cause the vegetable to get soft and brown in a certain area. You can still eat the vegetable, but you probably want to remove the bruised section., Lettuce and dark leafy greens naturally may get brown spots on them or pink areas on the stems. This is all natural. Just cut off the discolored sections. The rest of the leaf is fine to eat.This discoloration may be caused by too much oxygen, a nutrient deficiency, or high temperatures.
 If your vegetables only have one small section that has become rotten, the rest of the vegetable is more than likely fine. Cut out the rotten section and check the rest of the vegetable. If the rest of it looks healthy, then you can eat it.Rotten spots, also called soft rot, can occur when the tissue of that particular spot is damaged, which makes it vulnerable to bacteria.
 Wilted greens or wrinkled skins donâ€™t mean that a vegetable is spoiled. It means they have lost some moisture. Most of this wilting or wrinkling can be fixed if you place the vegetable in an ice bath or cook it.

 Remove any surface dirt from the car's exterior by washing it using a non-drying soap and water. Dry it clean with soft cotton towels or by allowing it to air dry. By removing as much dirt from the surface as possible, you allow the chemicals in the pre-wax cleaner to get directly to the layer of wax instead of having to contend with layers of grime and gunk first.;
, Strictly speaking, a spray on wax remover is a more legitimate pre-wax cleaner.


Spray on wax removers strip the wax off a car but do not do much else. They do not clean deep and do not remove contaminants that lurk below the surface. However, because they do not cleanse deeply, they make a good choice for someone who likes to frequently strip old wax and apply new wax.
Non-abrasive polishes cleanse a little more deeply. They are used for less frequent strippings and clean dirt that settles beneath the surface of the paint. Their primary purpose is not to remove wax, but that is a secondary effect.
 Apply the cleaner liberally, but make sure that you only get it on the paint of the car and not the plastic or rubber trim. If allowed to soak into plastic or rubber, wax removers have the tendency to discolor., Use a soft terry cloth to wipe the wax remover along the paint using side to side and top to bottom motions. Spread the wax remover using long, even strokes.
 If your first application of wax remover did not remove all the wax, you may apply another coating. Avoid repeating this too often, however, since too many applications on unprotected paint can gradually start to damage the point.
 Since plastic and rubber can become discolored when you use wax removers, a milder all-purpose car exterior cleanser is a better option. Apply the cleaner directly onto a clean terry cloth rag.
 Apply light, even pressure along the trim to remove as much of the old wax as possible.

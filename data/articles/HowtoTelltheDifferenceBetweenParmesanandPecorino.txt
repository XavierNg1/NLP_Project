 Parmesan is made from cow's milk, whereas Pecorino is made from ewe's milk. In fact, the word "pecora" is Italian for "ewe". Italians refer to Parmesan as "Parmigiano Reggiano".;
, Each cheese comes with its own texture and "ripeness":


Parmesan: is a fruity flavoured cheese with a peppery after-taste. It tends to be sold at varying stages of ripeness, which impacts the strength of its taste but its texture usually remains the same, hard and grainy.
Pecorino: this is a sharp, salty-flavoured cheese. Pecorino tends to be most widely available after considerable aging or ripening. Pecorino is hard like Parmesan and grates well. It is also possible to get a softer Pecorino, however, and this is where it can differ from Parmesan in texture. If you purchase fresher, younger Pecorino, you will discover that it is softer, with a lighter colouring and a texture similar to a firm Brie. It also tastes less strong.
 Both cheese types are similar, and so are fairly interchangeable unless you prefer one for any particular reason. Providing both cheese types on a cheese platter is a good serving suggestion. And both are fine for cooking, so feel free to substitute Pecorino for Parmesan in your favourite recipes, as the taste will be fairly similar.

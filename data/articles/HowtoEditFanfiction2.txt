 If the story uses canon characters from the work which the fanfiction is based upon, then review the original material immediately before reading the fanfiction. Pay careful attention to how the character acts and speaks, and determine whether or not the character is properly written in the fanfiction. One of many fanfiction readers' biggest pet peeves is when characters are written out-of-character, so this step is extremely important.
 Look over their character traits and determine whether or not the character is a Mary Sue/Gary Stu, which is generally hated in fanfiction communities. If so, advise the author on how they can improve the character. Additionally, original characters are difficult to fully flesh out, so be sure to be on the lookout for flat OCs. If the fanfiction is long and takes place over a long period of time, then pay attention to how the character is developing and suggest ways in which this could happen.

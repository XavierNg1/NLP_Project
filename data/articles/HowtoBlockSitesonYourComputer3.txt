 Internet routers typically have more precise controls available. For instance, you may be able to block websites at certain times of day, or on certain days of the week. This is also a convenient method if you would like to block a website for multiple devices at the same time., If you have the instructions or manual that came with your router, consult it for specific instructions. Otherwise, try entering each of the following into your browser's address bar, since most common brands use one of these addresses:http://192.168.1.1
http://192.168.0.1
http://192.168.1.2
http://192.168.10.1
http://10.0.1.1

, If no one has changed your router's username and password information, it is most likely using one of the default passwords. Search for the brand name of your router on a site like routerpasswords.com, or do a general google search for that brand name and "default password."


The most common default username is "admin" and the most common default password is "password".
 Once your are logged in, many router options should be available to change. Each router brand is somewhat different, but website blocking options are usually found under "Access Restrictions," "Content Filtering," "Parental Controls," or a similar phrase.

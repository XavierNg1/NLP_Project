If your dog is on medications, make sure you leave instructions for dosage and administration. It is important to be as specific as possible in preparing the person taking care of your dog, especially if that person has little or no experience with dogs or other animals., Especially if your dog has a unique diet or you make food at home, preparing these in advance will make it easier for your sitter to care for the dog. You can place the food for each meal in a ziplock bag or other food storage container. Label each container to make it easy for your pet sitter to find just the right meal.


If you’ve included medication in the dog’s food, make a note of this so your sitter knows they should monitor your dog to ensure they take the medicine., If your dog has access to a doggy door and is house broken, your sitter will not need to spend as much time in your home. If your pup stays in a crate during the day, make sure your sitter knows how often they need to be let out. This ensures your sitter maintains your dog’s daily routine, which will reduce the risk that your dog will misbehave or be stressed while you’re away. It also helps to prevent accidents in the home., You might think your instructions are thorough, but give them to your sitter in advance. Before you leave, ask if they’ve thought of any questions you can answer for them. You should also give your sitter a phone number or email address where they can reach you with additional questions later.

 If you need to add air to your tires, and don't have a compressor laying about the house—most people don't—head for your nearest gas station. Make sure you bring a a couple dollars worth of quarters with you, as a few minutes of compressed air can cost $1.00USD or more.


A handy device to have around the garage is a portable tire inflator that it plugs into the 12v power socket in your car. It is available wherever tire pressure gauges are sold.
 This is the same cap and valve you used to check the pressure.
 This may be by a switch, if using a home compressor, or by plugging the machine with quarters, for a service station compressor. It'll start hissing.
 Press down firmly, just like you did with the pressure gauge, and squeeze the valve trigger. If it hisses loudly, press more firmly until the hissing stops or is minimized.









How much lower than normal your pressure was will determine how long you want to keep the compressor filling the tire. Most tire compressors have a sliding gauge coming out of the top that pops up when you release the valve trigger. Don't rely on it for total accuracy, but as a general guideline to see if you're getting close to your desired psi.
When close, use your own tire pressure gauge to check, and either add more air in short 5-second bursts, or use the gauge to press the pin inside the valve stem and let air out, if you've over-filled the tire.
 When each tire has been inflated to the proper pressure, replace the cap, and repeat for all 4 tires plus the spare.









If you had to drive more than a couple miles to the service station, your tires will warm up, and the air pressure will increase as a result. If your readings indicate that you need add, for example, 10psi to the tire, then add 10psi, no matter what the current reading says. Check a few hours later, after the tires have cooled down, to verify the correct inflation.

 You can brake or decelerate your car by downshifting instead of applying pressure on the brake pad. In order to do this:
Remove your foot from the accelerator and let the car naturally decelerate.






Depress the clutch and move the gear lever into the gear immediately below the gear you're currently in.






Continue allowing the car to decelerate naturally.






When your speed hits the next lowest gear's wheelhouse, downshift again. Continue downshifting until you've hit first gear. Using this technique requires more space and more time to decelerate.
 If you're in second gear and your RPM is through the roof, you should shift into third gear soon. If you're in fourth gear and your RPM is really low, you should probably downshift into third gear. Here's a rundown of approximately what gear you should be in according to how fast you are going. Speeds and gears will vary depending on what car you drive:
0–15 mph (0–24 km/h): First gear






15–30 mph (24–48 km/h): Second gear






30–45 mph (48–72 km/h): Third gear






45–60 mph (72–97 km/h): Fourth gear






60 mph (97 km/h) and above: Fifth gear






75 mph (121 km/h) and above: Sixth gear (not all cars have six gears)







, One cool thing about having a manual transmission is that you can kick your car into neutral very easily and just "coast." Perhaps you reached the top of a mountain and are now going downhill. Instead of accelerating by shifting, you can let the car accelerate by putting the car into neutral.


If you're in neutral and going 40 mph (64 km/h), you should shift directly into fourth gear. If you're in neutral and going 15 mph (24 km/h), you should shift directly into second gear, and so on.

 If you think that someone likes you, try to find out more. Put your arm around her during a movie to see how she reacts; give him an extra-long hug and try to gauge his interest; smile slyly back when you catch him staring. Be bold and flirtatious, and you might be able to bring a bit more clarity to the situation.
 If you're pretty sure that this person is attracted to you, then there's a good chance that he/she likes you at least a little bit. It is natural to want to be sure – but at some point, you'll need to make a move. This can take many forms: asking someone out, hooking up with someone, or just telling someone how you feel.Do not be forceful, and try not to make too many assumptions. Be respectful, always.
 Ultimately, direct communication is the surest way to know that someone is attracted to you. If you think that there's a mutual attraction, try to get this person alone for a conversation. Lead in slowly, if you like, or come out and confess your feelings. Kiss the person, if the moment feels right. Talk about your feelings and and establish a mutual understanding.
 Someone may well be attracted to you, but that does not necessarily mean that he or she wants to begin a physical or emotional relationship with you. Attraction is a primal sensation. We cannot necessarily control when and whether we feel it – but we can choose where we direct it and how we respond to it. Think carefully about the consequences of acting on mutual attraction.If this person is already in a relationship with someone else, he or she may have committed to monogamy. Consider whether it is your place to disturb that agreement.
The person in question might not be looking for any sort of relationship, period. Know that your attitude toward attraction is not necessarily the same as everyone else's attitude toward attraction.

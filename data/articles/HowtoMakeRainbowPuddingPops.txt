 Combine the instant pudding mix packages and milk in a large bowl.;
, Place the bowl in the refrigerator for a few minutes to accelerate time.
 Divide the pudding into five small bowls. Drop about 2 to 3 drops of food coloring into the bowls, so each one is a different color. Quickly mix each color so that the food coloring is distributed evenly through the pudding.
 Fill up the cups in the following order in even amounts. It's best to distribute the first color with a certain measurement (start out with 2 tablespoons in each cup) until gone before adding the next layer.


Blue (bottom of the cup)
Green
Yellow
Orange
Red (top of the cup)

, Cover each cup with aluminum foil and stick a Popsicle stick in the middle of the foil.
 Transfer the cups to the freezer, preferably overnight.
 Tear off the paper cups from the frozen pudding pop for faster serving.

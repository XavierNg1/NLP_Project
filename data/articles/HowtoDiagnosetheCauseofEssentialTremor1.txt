 Though the exact cause of essential tremor is unknown, it may be passed down through family genes. If any of your family members have essential tremor, such as a parent, you are more likely to have the gene that causes essential tremor. This is called familial tremor, where one parent has the gene, making you more susceptible to the condition.Ask your parents if they have essential tremor. Speak to your family members to determine if they have essential tremor or if it runs in your family.;
, You can also note if any of your family members are starting to show signs of the condition. The symptoms tend to appear in people over the age of 65, though they can start to manifest in middle age. Look for symptoms like:Head nodding.
Shaking or quivering of their arms, head, and eyelids.
A shaking or quivering sound to their voice, as the tremor can affect their voice box.
Difficulties writing, drawing, drinking from a cup, or using tools.
The tremors may come and go but often get worse over time. They may or may not affect both sides of the personâ€™s body in the same way.
 If you suspect you may have inherited the gene for essential tremor, speak to your doctor about getting a test for the gene. Your doctor will test a swab taken from the inside of your mouth to see if you have the genetic mutation that causes essential tremor.Genetic testing does not change treatment or management options, but it can help you predict whether or not you are genetically predisposed to having essential tremor.

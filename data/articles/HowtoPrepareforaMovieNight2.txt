 Ask your friends for suggestions ahead of time. Find out what they've already seen and what they never want to see too! It is a good idea to send a text, update or email around with suggestions and have everyone agree to the final choice(s).


You can have multiple movies if it's going to be a marathon movie watching night.
 If you're giving them dinner first, schedule that into the timing. If it's just snacks, give around half an hour from the suggested arrival time until starting the movie, to allow time for latecomers. You can always start earlier if your friends all turn up on time.
 Bring in plenty of cushions, pillows and blankets. Let everyone choose what they want to snuggle up to when they enter the room. Make sure that there is plenty of space for sitting, lying down and moving about too.


Let your friends know where the bathroom is. Have a signal to pause the movie if someone needs to go during the movie.
You can move furniture around if it helps to create more space.
 Definitely popcorn! You can also serve fruit slices, chips, cookies and water. Don't overdo the snacks, especially if you've just had dinner.
 Hit the lights, and action!

 An operating assets ratio is the operating assets divided by total assets less cash It is used to analyze which company assets are not contributing to revenue and can therefore be reduced or eliminated. The formula is: operating assets/total non-cash assets., These include inventory, accounts receivable, fixtures and production equipment. Be sure to also include all non-production equipment, obsolete inventory and overdue accounts receivable. Note that cash will not be used in this calculation.


For example, $85,000 inventory + $50,000 accounts receivable + $10,000 fixtures + $70,000 production equipment + $120,000 non-production equipment + $90,000 obsolete inventory + $75,000 overdue account receivable = $500,000 total operating assets.
 Divide $215,000 by $500,000 = .43 operating assets ratio. Compare this to the ratio of competitors that you can find on their balance sheet published on their website. The lower the ratio the better.This example identifies $285,000 of non-revenue generating assets that could be reduced or eliminated and converted into cash. Obsolete inventory and non-production equipment could be sold and overdue accounts receivable could be written off.

 In elementary school, some teachers didn't care if you didn't have your homework that day, and it wouldn't hurt your grade. In seventh grade, it does. A lot. Missing one homework assignment might get you after-school detention, and for most schools missing seven or more will get you into summer school.
 Lots of the teachers will not approve of silly behaviour and slacking. Some teachers will even send you to the principal or head teacher without a warning, and that is bad.
 This is the most important thing you can do in your academic life. If you don't understand something in class, stay after school or during lunch to have the teacher explain it. You may hate this teacher, but when it comes to learning and asking real questions, teachers have a soft heart.
 This is the most important thing. In elementary school, if you didn't do your work, or you had a D or and F for your grade, you would still move on to the next grade. That doesn't happen anymore. If in any of your classes you have an F, you can bring it up if you try hard. One failure won't keep you back for another year. But if you get an F in most of your classes and don't do anything about it, you might have a problem.
 It's so much more fun having a study group to work with!

, Get all the help in school if you don't understand something. Study with friends. Just do something to enhance your education if you need help in school.
 This is effective since you can have fun and study at the same time!

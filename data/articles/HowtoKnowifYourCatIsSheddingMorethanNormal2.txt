 Buy grooming supplies like gloves, brushes, and combs, so you can brush your cat. Try to brush your cat every few days to remove excess hair and track how much hair your cat is shedding. Regular brushing will help you decide if your cat is shedding more than normal.If you have a long-haired cat, use a long comb that can brush all the way to your cat's skin.
 After you've brushed your cat's fur, look at its skin. The skin should be white. If it looks red, bumpy, or irritated and you think your cat is shedding too much, you should take your cat to the vet. This is especially important if your cat seems bothered by a patch of its skin or fur.You should also look at the texture of your cat's fur. If some parts of the fur feel different, your cat may have a health condition that needs to be checked.

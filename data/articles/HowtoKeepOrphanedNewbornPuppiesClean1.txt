 In the event of the mother dog’s death or absence, she will not be able to perform several crucial actions at the time of delivery. This first of these is to remove the amniotic membrane, or the clear sac that the puppies are born in. It is necessary to remove this immediately in order for the pups to breathe. Simply break this membrane with your fingers, and slide the puppies out.Be certain that your hands are clean before touching the newborn puppies.;
, Next, you will need to remove the umbilical cord. Normally, a mother dog would bite this. Use a pair of sharp scissors to snip this cord, leaving approximately ½ an inch of cord on the puppy. Then use a piece of thread or string to tie this off., Mucus must be cleared away from each puppy’s mouth, nose, and throat. This can be done with a rubber bulb syringe (the same kind you would use for a human baby). Simply depress the bulb syringe, place it close to the area you want to cleanse, and then release the depression. This should suck the mucus out. Cleanse the bulb syringe after each puppy, or as needed.To clean the throat, wrap your non-dominant arm around the puppy, and use that hand to hold their mouth open. Then, holding the bulb syringe in your dominant hand, place it as close to the back of the throat as you can. Depress the bulb, and suck out the mucus.
 Although the puppies will be bit a sticky, do not place them in water or bathe them. It is extremely crucial for the puppies to stay warm, and this will be especially difficult without their mother. You can wipe them down with a warm towel, and then place them near a heating pad to stay warm.

 Hardware cloth or ½" x ½" (1.25cm x 1.25cm) welded wire mesh should make up the bottom 2 feet (0.6 m) of fence, plus all buried sections. Unlike chicken wire, the fox cannot get his teeth around this mesh to tear through it.


For extra protection, use two layers of mesh.
 Foxes are excellent diggers. Bury the wire barrier at least 8 inches (20 cm) deep, or up to 12 inches (30 cm) if the soil is loose or sandy. Bend the mesh at a 90º angle and extend it outward 8 inches (20 cm), so the fox can't find a way past if it digs downward.Weigh down the horizontal layer with bricks or rubble before you cover it with soil, to make digging even harder.
 A large fox can jump or climb an impressive height. An ordinary fence should be at least 6 ft (1.8m) high to keep out foxes. You can get away with as low as 5 ft (1.5m) if you bend the top of the fence outward to form a long overhang.Try an overhang that bends outward at a 45º angle and extends 19 inches (50cm)., This is one of the most effective ways to deter foxes.Foxes usually examine the fence before trying to climb or jump. If they come into contact with an electric wire, the painful shock will usually discourage them from trying. Run three wires for best results: one at fox head height, one along the top, and one in the middle. You'll also need an energizer that produces about 5,000–7,000 volts.This will discourage most jumpers, so you can risk building a lower fence.
If there are hedgehogs in your area, the lowest electric wire should be at least 6 inches (15 cm) off the ground to prevent accidental death. Other small mammals are usually fine.Electric fences are not recommended in areas with young children.
The fox must make a connection between the electric wire and the ground to get a shock. If your fence isn't grounded, run a ground wire about an inch (2.5 cm) apart from the middle and upper wires.
Alternatively, use electric netting.

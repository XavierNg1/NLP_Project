 These are listed below under "Things You'll Need".
 It should be about 45 centimeter (17.7 in) in length.
 This should create a round ball shape, which becomes the dolly's head.
 Cut a small bundle to about 12 centimeter (4.7 in) in length. Push this through the body, just under the head. Tie a piece of raffia directly under the arms on the body to keep them in place. This also form's the corn dolly's torso.
, Braid a long length of raffia. Tie little knots each end to prevent unraveling. Then, fold each end of the braid to meet at the middle, creating loops that look like little braids hanging down.
 Use raffia or string.
 Measure the dolly's head and make a doughnut shaped ring that would just fit around her head. Wrap raffia around and around this to make a well-covered ring. Place on the dolly's head.
 You can display the dolly as she is now or add ornamental grasses and dried flowers through her skirt and on top of her head to improve her overall appearance. Use ribbon to prettify the corn dolly too.

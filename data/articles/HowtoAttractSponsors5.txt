 Companies tend to sponsor people who represent their image. For example, an outdoor company will be more likely to sponsor a ‘Grizzly Adams’-type with a rustic feel. Think about what your image is and who that might appeal to.What kind of fans do you attract? What are the interests of people who follow you?

, In order to attract some sponsors, you have to be good at whatever you do and get a fair amount of attention. For example, if you are an athlete, you need to win competitions and have a substantial fan base. The better you are and the more attention you get, the more likely you are to attract a sponsor.If you are not very good at what you do, it will be very difficult to attract a sponsor. However, it may be possible if you have an entertaining gimmick. Are you known for your reputation, like being the “bad boy” of your profession? Do you have an interesting backstory that people find interesting?

, Depending on what you do, the type of sponsorships will vary dramatically. For example, as a professional athlete, you may get lucrative marketing deals that help support you, or you might get discounted products to wear to competitions. Although the company determines much of this, having an idea of what you want will be useful during negotiations.Talk to other people in your field and ask about their sponsorships. Knowing the sponsorships of people at a similar level as yourself can be useful to know when meeting a sponsor.
 Once you have determined what companies would be a good match for you, begin reaching out to them. Contact the person in charge of sponsorships or the company’s marketing department. Let them know how many followers you have and how you mesh with their image.Stress your strengths and accomplishments, but do not be arrogant about it.
Sometimes contacting a smaller local company may be more successful since many people looking for sponsorships aim for large national brands.

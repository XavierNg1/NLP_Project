 Cooking dinner can be an intimate experience that provides a lot of opportunities for laughing and future stories. You can choose your favorite recipe or something really simple, depending on how good of a cook you are.If you can, gather up a few mood-setting materials such as candles, fancy plates, and a romantic playlist to make your dinner date really special.


If you’re new to cooking, try making spaghetti. All you need to do to make a simple spaghetti is to boil noodles, heat up a jar of sauce, and sprinkle on some cheese. Add a bagged salad and it’s like you’re in a restaurant.
If you already have some cooking skills, find out what your date’s favorite meal is and try to make that with them.
 Grab a film and few great snacks, then settle in. Movie nights are a great chance for you to share some of your interests with each other in the form of your favorite movies. You can watch movies from your own collections, stream them through an online service, check one out from the library, or rent from Redbox.
 Game nights can be a fun way to spend date night, and they’re also excellent for double dates. Bring your favorite board games, a few tasty snacks, and the drink of your choice. It’s a great opportunity to carry on a conversation and share memories from your childhood.Make sure that you choose two-player games if it’s just the two of you.
Avoid games that might cause arguments, such as Monopoly.
 Whether it’s gaming, books, art, sports, or a common hobby, plan your date around an activity that you both love.For example, you might face off on a favorite video game or make a collaborative art project. You could also go on an adventure to check out what’s new or what interests both of you.

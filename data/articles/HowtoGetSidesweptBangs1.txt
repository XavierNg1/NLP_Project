 Use your fingers as a barrier so that you don't cut too short. For a less straight edge cut, cut the bangs while the scissors are pointed vertically. You can also use this method after making the initial horizontal cut.



Beginner's tip: Cut your bangs a little longer than is ideal at first and see how you like itâ€”you can always cut more later if it's too long, but once it's too short you'll just have to wait for it to grow back.

Open them and beginning at the length of the last section you cut, run the blade in short up and down strokes while ultimately traveling down the strand.

 You can do this technique in any context. It’s great if you work together or are already friends. If you are in a situation with a lot of other people, you may need to say or do something to get your crush’s attention so that you can make eye contact.Don’t do anything too outlandish to get your crush’s attention. Simply saying, “Excuse me, do you have the time?” or saying, “Hello” is plenty.
 This might seem obvious but sometimes if you have a crush on someone, you’ll feel so nervous that you’ll forget to smile. As soon as your crush makes eye contact with you, let a nice big smile show on your face.People can subconsciously tell if a smile is real or fake. To make sure that your smile looks warm and genuine let your teeth show and make sure that your eyes squint up, creating crows feet on your face.
 This may be a little bit confusing, since it’s more subtle. To add energy to the interaction, simply let the positive and nervous feelings you have around the person energize the way you look at them. Don’t try to hide it. Some ways to add energy are:Take a deep breath and let it out through your mouth.
Straighten your posture.
 You can try waving, touching your face, winking, or brushing back your hair. You can smile, shift your eyes a bit, and lick your lips if you're feeling a little bit bold. Choose small facial gestures that work for you.Winking can be flirtatious, but is sometimes viewed as old fashioned, or even creepy depending on the context. Use your intuition to tell you if it would work well with your crush.
You can also blink slightly more often around your crush. This is something people do subconsciously when they’re around someone they’re attracted to. It will help send subtle messages that you like them.

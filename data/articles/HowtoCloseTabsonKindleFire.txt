 You'll need to be in your internet browser in order to close tabs. The most common browser for Kindle, the one that comes pre-installed, is known as Silk.;
, Hold the device so that it is longer than it is wide, or so the long side is pointing up. While you can close tabs in any mode, this one is easier to use and navigate online., On Silk, the tabs will be along the top edge. They resemble the tops of paper folders, arraigned horizontally with the name of the website within the tab. If you have lots of tabs open, the tabs might be small, with two arrows on the sides of the window that reveal tabs that don't fit on your screen.

In Chrome and Firefox, there is a small box with a number in it in the upper right corner. Click it to reveal your tabs.
 When you are done browsing a tab, close it by simply tapping on the X symbol at the right side of the tab. Each individual tab has its own "close" button., Tap on the plus (+) symbol at the top of the window to add tabs to your window. This will open a window displaying all of your most frequently visited websites.
 A pop-up box will appear. Select the “Close all tabs” option to close all tabs. Simply click it to start your browser with fresh, untouched tabs.

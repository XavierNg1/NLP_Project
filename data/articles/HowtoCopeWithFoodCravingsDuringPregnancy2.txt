 During pregnancy, obtaining the proper nutrients in your diet is key, not just for your own health but for the health of the growing baby inside of you. While indulging your food cravings in moderation from time to time is okay, don't let it come at the expense of an overall healthy diet.Healthy recommendations for pregnancy are (serving breakdown) a diet comprised of 20% protein, 30% fat, and 50% carbohydrates.To break it down based on the food pyramid, an example of a healthy diet during pregnancy would look as follows: 6-11 servings of grains, 3-5 servings of vegetables, 2-4 servings of fruit, 3-4 servings of dairy, and 2-3 servings of meats, beans, or nuts.Note that whole grains (and non-refined sources of carbohydrates) are a better choice, especially when it comes to keeping your blood sugars in a healthy range.
 This way, if you are having a craving, before you reach for a slice of cake or a piece of candy, you can see if you can satisfy your hunger with one of your pre-made healthier snacks.
 If weight gain is a concern for you, avoid cravings for desserts and high-fat foods (such as processed foods) or high-calorie foods (such as excessive carbohydrates).


On average, you need to consume only 300 more calories per day during pregnancy than you did prior to pregnancy.Although you are "eating for two," the second is a very small baby so the calorie requirements during pregnancy are not much different than prior to pregnancy.
The average woman should gain between 20 to 35lbs during pregnancy.However, it depends on your weight prior to pregnancy, so speak to your doctor if you want specific recommendations for your own weight gain during pregnancy.
 Although most cravings during pregnancy are okay in moderation, some women actually get cravings for non-food items such as dirt, clay, or laundry starch, among others.This condition (of cravings for non-food items) is called "pica."


While incompletely understood, it is hypothesized that pica may be due to low iron or other nutrient deficiencies (shortages of vitamins or minerals) in the body.If you experience cravings for non-food items on any consistent basis, it is best to see your doctor for further advice.

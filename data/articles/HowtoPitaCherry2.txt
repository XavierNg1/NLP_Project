 You will need one that is no wider than the pit of the cherry. Wash it before use.
 If there are any bruises, splits, or patches of mold then dispose of it and pick another one. If it is fine then continue.


Wash the cherries in water that is roughly 10 degrees (Fahrenheit) above room temperature in order to prevent damage to the fruit.
 Try to stay close to the center, making sure not to unnecessarily cut out too much of the cherry. Stop pushing it in when it is alongside the pit.
 Keep it as close to the pit as possible to avoid removing the flesh of the fruit.
 If the stem has fallen off, use the paper clip as a lever to pull the pit out. Repeat the process with as many additional cherries as you wish.

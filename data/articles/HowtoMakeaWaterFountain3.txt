 It should be glass or something else that is waterproof. It should not have any holes or method for water to escape.
 You'll most importantly need a large whelk or conch seashell. The rest of the seashells can be random jumbles. You'll also probably want some river or beach rocks.
 You'll need to run a tube from the pump and into the large shell. Get a rotary tool with a ceramic drill bit and start with the smallest size, then work your way up until the hole is large enough to fit the tube through. This will probably be around 3/4". If you run out of rotary bits that are large enough, use a round file to get the hole to size.


Sand the hole smooth afterward to remove any glass burrs and rough edges.
 Place the pump in the bottom of the bowl. Attach a rubber tube to the pump and then fit the other end into the large shell.
 Use silicone sealant around the opening to make it watertight and help keep the tube in place. Allow the sealant to set.
 Cover the pump in rocks and then shells or other waterproof decorative items. Set the large shell on top and angle the spout slightly downward.
 You're done! Enjoy your fountain!

 Start this method of tying a constrictor knot by tying a clove hitch. Make two loops in a rope; the left loop should be twisted above the rest of the rope, and the right loop should be twisted below. Place the right loop over the left loop, then insert a pole or stick through the loops. Pull the ends of the rope to tighten your clove knot.
 Pick up the working end of the rope (i.e. the end of the rope of the right-hand side, if you are right-handed). Pull the rope over and into the top loop of the knot. Pull the rope back through to the right., Grab each end of the rope and brace them with your index fingers and thumbs. Pull the rope tightly on both sides. Your clove hitch knot is now a constrictor knot.

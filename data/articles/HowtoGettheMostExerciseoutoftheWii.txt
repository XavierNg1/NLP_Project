 The Wii was meant to be played standing up, but you can sometimes get around that and just play sitting. Don't.;
, For example, instead of just doing the minimum when playing Tennis in Wii Sports, play like you're actually swinging the Wii Remote.
 If you are playing a First Person Shooter like Call of Duty 3, run in place whenever you are moving your character. Lean to the side whenever you are going behind cover.

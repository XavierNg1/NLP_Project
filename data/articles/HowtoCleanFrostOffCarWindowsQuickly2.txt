 Specially-formulated de-icing fluid is available at most auto shops, especially if you live in an area with cold winters. However, if you don't have any de-icer on hand or you just want to save money, it's not hard to make your own. Follow the simple instructions below:To make your own de-icer, pour rubbing alcohol into a clean, dry spray bottle. Add a few drops of dish soap. Screw the lid on, then invert several times to mix.
 Whether you bought de-icer or made your own, you'll use it the same way. Spray your de-icer directly on to the icy parts of your window, then allow it to soak in briefly. You shouldn't need to wait more than a minute or two - the more de-icer you use, the less time you'll have to wait.
 Use a plastic scraper, a gloved hand, or another tool to scrape the ice away. You should find that it comes off of your window much quicker and easier than it normally would, saving you time overall. If needed, re-apply your de-icer to difficult spots as you scrape.


In commercial concentrations, rubbing alcohol has a very low freezing point, so it's usually OK to leave your de-icer in the car unless you're expecting temperatures of -20 F (-29 C) or lower.

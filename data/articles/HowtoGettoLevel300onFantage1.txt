 Every month, they give you a veteran medal just for being on Fantage. So make sure you don't abandon your Fantage account!;
, Buy a game card, or use an American Express Card. When you become a member on Fantage, you instantly go up 15 levels. And you get more stuff when you're a Premium Member, anyway.
 Every time you do the daily quiz, you level up. The maximum levels you can get from it is 50. Do the daily quiz every day and you'll soon get 50 level ups.
 On the lower left corner of your screen, there is "Invite a Friend" icon. Invite two of your friends to join Fantage. They have to make an account and play an hour though, in order for you to get your "Invite a Friend" medal. And who wouldn't want to chat with their friends on Fantage??

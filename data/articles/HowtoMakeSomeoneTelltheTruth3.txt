 Evasion is often a hint that someone is lying to you. Trying to change the subject or simply refusing to answer at all is a big clue. Most times a person will talk about anything if they aren’t hiding something., The sound and pitch of a person’s voice will often change if they are lying. Their voice may get higher, they may speak quicker, or you may even be able to hear a quiver in their speech. Any type of change could be a signal they are lying.


You’ll need to become familiar with the person’s voice to know if they are lying. Start by asking questions you already know the answer to and notice the way they sound as they answer. Move on to questions you don’t know the answer to once you’ve become comfortable with their voice. They are likely lying if there are changes in their voice.However, this would not be the case with a pathological liar or sociopath.
 The appearance of a person can dramatically change if they are lying. Not telling the truth makes people nervous and their bodies often act accordingly. Even the smallest change in their behavior may indicate a lie.


For instance, a person may try to hide their mouth or their eyes when they are telling a lie. You may also notice them fidgeting, swallowing more, and clearing their throat excessively. They may also avoid looking you in the eye and laugh nervously.

 This may come in handy if you have visited a few sites that you aren't supposed to visit, but you don't want to delete the entire web history. Perhaps you want to keep some information, but delete other data; perhaps you just think it will look suspicious if you delete the entire browser history. Either way, you can select to delete the local record of any and all sites that you have visited since you started using Chrome.
 Press Ctrl+H or use the menu in the top-right of the browser.
 Select the box next to each piece of web history that you want to delete. Select as many items as necessary. You can select entire chunks of site data by holding Shift while you click a certain box, then clicking a box further down the list. Use the search box at the top of the History tab to find any links or keywords that you want to erase.
 This button is only clickable once you have selected at least one website to delete.
 You will be prompted with a pop-up dialogue box: "Are you sure you want to delete these pages from your history?" Don't hesitate to backtrack and double-check that you aren't about to erase anything important. When you are absolutely sure, you can proceed.
 Chrome will permanently remove the sites you selected from the browsing history.

 Those little red numbers at the top of your profile can be terribly addicting. Limit your urge to click by limiting the notifications you get from Facebook. Click "Settings" (top right) and choose Account settings. Then, Notifications. Switch some of the options off. Some good choices include “Birthdays,” “On This Day,” and “Close Friends Activity.”, Even if you’re not logged in to Facebook, you might receive a pop-up on your desktop, or an audio notification on your phone. If this pulls you in to Facebook more than you’d like, go to “Account settings,” then “Notifications," and edit your settings for desktop and mobile., Just as you can edit other forms of notification, you can revise your email settings through Facebook (visit "Account settings," then "Notifications"). Another easy option is to use an email filter. If you use Gmail, for example, simply create a filter and in the "From" field, enter "@facebook.com." Then, select "Skip the Inbox (Archive it)"., If you enjoy getting mobile notifications at some times, but not at others, you can simply turn off your Facebook app’s access to cellular data as a kind of temporary “do not disturb” option. If Facebook cannot access data, it can’t update, and therefore cannot send push notifications.


Simply visit the "Settings" area on your phone and look for a tab marked "Cellular" or "Cellular Data." Here you will be able to switch off cellular data for individual apps, or for phone you phone altogether.
 A more drastic way to limit your Facebook is to delete the app from your phone altogether. You will still be able to access Facebook from your computer (or technically, even through an internet browser on your phone), but you will be far less tempted (or able) to check your Facebook every 15 minutes.

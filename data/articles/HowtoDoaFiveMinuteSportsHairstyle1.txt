 If you have shorter hair, a classic bun will quickly become messy.
 Get one that suits your hair type (this is usually written on the bottle), but don't worry too much about brand names.
 Twist your hair and wrap it around the base of the ponytail, forming a bun shape.
 If the ends are sticking out, tuck them into an elastic, or secure them with bobby pins.


You can also use hair wax, or allow strands of hair to fall out naturally. Just remember that the more you allow loose strands to fall out, the more likely it is that your hairstyle will become messy.

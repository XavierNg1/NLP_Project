 In the upper left of the Google Earth window, you'll see a set of controls. Use this guide:

, If North America is not your home continent, rotate the earth by using the Rotate Joystick tool.


Click the left arrow to rotate towards Asia, the right arrow to rotate towards Europe, the up arrow to head to the North Pole, and the down arrow should you live in Antarctica.
Alternately, you can just click and drag Earth in the direction you wish to go.
 Rotate the Earth to the east (assuming a North American starting point). Using the joystick arrow as described, rotate the Earth to the east until France comes into view. If it's not in the center of the screen, use the joystick arrows to move it up or down towards the center. Use the outer ring of the Pan Joystick tool to rotate France into the proper position.


When it's about centered on your screen, double-click on it.
With the first double click, France is in the center of your screen, and you'll see the capital cities of Europe. In the north of France, you'll see Paris. Double-click Paris. After a quick and dizzying journey, you'll zoom from many miles above earth to around 2,000 feet (600 meters).
Press the up arrow on the Pan Joystick, and the landscape of France will open up in front of you. It's as if you were looking straight down, and now you're lifting your head up. When you are looking out across the land instead of down on it, Use the outer ring of the Pan Joystick, and move the N icon to be due south. You'll now be looking at the city.
Use the Zoom controls to zoom in. When you find a neighborhood to explore, click on the orange person icon, and place it to enter Street View.
 Now that you're in Street View, you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to "walk" the streets of Paris. Or your hometown. Or virtually any place in the world.

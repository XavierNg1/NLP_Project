 This method can be time consuming as you have to iron each bill one separately, but it's a time saver for those with just a few bills. Find a well-functioning iron with a sturdy ironing board. Make sure all the windows are closed and the fan is off so the bills don't blow away while ironing.
 Arrange as many as you can on the board, but you may need to iron them in separate sessions if you have a lot of wet currency. For those who want to add crispness as well, spray extra crisp heavy starch onto the bills., You may be tempted to set the iron temperature higher in order to dry the bill faster. However, this can lead the bills to become burnt or even set aflame in some instances. Take the time and make sure itâ€™s on the lowest heat setting so your bills are dried without becoming damaged.
 Move the iron over the bill in a steady, back-and-forth motion. Never place the iron on the bill and wait. This will cause the bill to catch on fire or become burnt. Iron the bill back and forth, and then flip the bill over to iron the backside. Each bill should be dried in about 30 seconds, but it may take longer depending on the saturation.

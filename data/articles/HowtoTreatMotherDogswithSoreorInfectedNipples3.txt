 It is good for the mother dog if her puppies nurse on all of the nipples. This will spread the wear on the nipples around equally and will use all of her mammary glands, which reduces the risk of her ducts getting blocked.If necessary, move the puppies around while they are nursing to use all of the mother's nipples. Puppies may naturally be drawn to certain nipples, especially the ones that give more milk, so you will need to intervene if you are concerned with the chance of an infection.
 Poor hygiene can promote infections and irritation of the nipples. If the mother is not adequately cleaning her nipples after nursing, then you should assist her.If you see the mother licking her nipples after nursing, then she is taking care of the nipple hygiene herself.
If she is not licking the nipples after nursing, you can use a warm, clean, damp cloth to wipe down the area. This should feel good to the mother dog in addition to keeping her nipples clean.
 If a mother dog is beginning to get sore nipples you should help alleviate the discomfort before they become really sore or infected. Look for signs that the mother is hesitant to let her puppies nurse. Also, inspect the mothers nipples for unusual redness or sensitivity.


If you see that a nipple is getting red and sensitive, try to keep puppies off of it for a feeding cycle. Apply a warm, moist compress to the nipple and make sure the nipple is clean. Then you can let the puppies back on it.
 Infections and irritation can be caused by trauma the puppies inflict while they are nursing. This is especially a risk factor once the puppies begin getting their baby teeth.If you see trauma on a nipple, such as a small cut, try to persuade the puppies to nurse from another nipple. Treat the nipple trauma under the direction of a veterinarian, as anything you apply to the nipple could be passed on to the puppies.

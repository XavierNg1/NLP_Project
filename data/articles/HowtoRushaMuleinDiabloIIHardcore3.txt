 Kill everything around the council area. This is very important, because just because the priests run from high level character. They will home in on the mule. So make sure everyone is dead. Don't kill council just yet.
 You can also try to position your mule on the ledge behind the building the council is in.
 You must kill all council within screen-shot of the mule or your mule will not get quest. Be careful of FE or Cold enhanced. Their death won't hurt you, but will take out your mule.
 Go to Durance level 3. Kill everything but Meph. Tp mule down. Your mule should be OK off to the side while you hack away at Mephisto; he doesn't last long. Mule should be about to take red portal to Act 4.

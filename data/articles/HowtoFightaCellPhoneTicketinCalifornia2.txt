 You can fight the ticket in one of two ways: by having a court trial or a trial by mail. A court trial is a two-step process: you request an arraignment where the judge reads the charges against you and you enter a plea. Then you attend a trial.


With a trial by written declaration, you never show up to court. You waive the arraignment and instead present written evidence. Not everyone has the option of a trial by written declaration. Check your ticket or courtesy notice, which might state you need to appear in court., Your traffic ticket should give you a date when you must appear in court. The state should also send you a reminder notice. Go to court on that date and ask the court clerk for an arraignment.You’ll need to schedule an arraignment and a trial date. They can be the same date or on different dates.


If you want them on the same day, you must pay your bail deposit. This amount will be refunded if you are found not guilty.At the arraignment, you will plead not guilty.
You can also request a trial by written declaration when you go to court.
 You don’t have to schedule an arraignment hearing. Instead, you can request a trial by stopping into the traffic clerk’s office at any point before your Notice to Appear date. Say you want to plead not guilty and ask for a trial date. If you choose this option, you must make a bail deposit.If you want a trial by written declaration, you can pick up the forms when you stop in.
 You can also schedule a trial date by calling the clerk and saying you want to waive your arraignment. State you are pleading not guilty and need a trial date. You’ll need to make a bail deposit., You might not be able to get to the courthouse. In this situation, you can plead not guilty and request a trial date by mail.Read your Notice to Appear to find out how. You’ll need to deposit your bail amount this way.


If you want a trial by declaration, include a self-addressed stamped envelope so that the court can mail you forms.

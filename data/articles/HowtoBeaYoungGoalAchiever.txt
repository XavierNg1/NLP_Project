 Most goals will require you to schedule your day to make sure you have to time work on your goal on top of school, sports, activities, and chores. Developing good time management skills will help you find time in the day to work on all your responsibilities with the minimum amount of stress. It is best to start working on these skills early on. That way, not only will you be better equipped to accomplish your short-term goals, but you'll have the necessary skills to succeed in your education and career as well.Make a list of your responsibilities. By putting your tasks down on a list, you are visualizing what you have to do. Then when you've written all your responsibilities, prioritize them. Is something on the list due tomorrow, while the others are due next week? That item has suddenly taken priority. Do you have two tests to study for, but one subject you're in danger of failing? Focus more on that subject. Remember to cross things off your list as well, so you can visually see the progress you're making.
Focus on one task at a time. While many people brag about multitasking, it often doesn't work out so well. By doing on multiple tasks at once, you're not allowing your full potential to focus on any one area. This is an inefficient usage of time. Instead, keep yourself focused on one task at a time so all your energy goes into it.;
, Many people suffer from excessive procrastination, teenagers especially. Unfortunately, this quality will get in the way of your goals if you never get anything done. Break this habit as soon as possible if you want to accomplish your goals.


Focus on starting a task instead of finishing it. If you keep thinking about how much work you have to do to finish something, you'll lose your motivation to do it. Instead, make yourself start the task. That way, once you get started, you can build up momentum and work until the end.Give yourself a reward when you finish something. If you have something to look forward to, you can stay motivated to work through the task. For example, you could say you'll play your favorite video game as soon as you finish your math homework. But remember to not give yourself the reward if you don't finish the task- that just teaches your brain that you'll get the reward anyway without doing any work.Stick to deadlines. You can't expect your time management to improve if you don't have any deadlines. This will teach you that you can procrastinate as much as you want without any consequences. Set deadlines to force yourself to manage your time properly and make sure you're focusing your efforts on the task at hand.Work somewhere with no distractions. If you do your work in the TV room, it's very tempting to reach over to the remote and flip the TV on. Eliminate those temptations by changing your work environment. Work somewhere there is no TV, music, or noises that will distract you. This will help you stay focused on the work at hand., When you're in school especially, you'll have to take many different classes and pass them, even if you're not interested in the subject. By developing a curiosity in different areas, you can help keep yourself focused on tasks or subjects you find boring. This is important because as you try to achieve your goals, you may have to learn about or do things that you didn't intend to. If you've already prepared your brain to do this, you'll be ahead of the curve when you try to accomplish goals.For example, say your goal is to become a doctor. You knew you would need to know about things like biology and anatomy, which are subjects you like. But you may not have realized the amount of math you'd have to do in medical school. If you've prepared your brain to focus on subjects you have less interest in, you'll have a much better chance of succeeding in this situation than if you had blown off math in school.
 Although being able to work for hours at a time is a good skill, it's just as important to know when you need to take a step back. While it may seem counter-productive, taking a break from your work actually helps make it better. When you're tired, your brain doesn't work as effectively. By taking a break, you help your brain recharge itself so you can come back to your task fresh. This can help you have that breakthrough you've been waiting for.Say your goal was to win first prize at the science fair for your robot design. But you're having a problem with the mechanism and you just can't figure out why. After working on it for several hours, you're exhausted. This is the time to take a break. When you walk away from the task and do something you enjoy, you'll help your brain recover. Then, while your brain isn't being forced to work under pressure, a light bulb goes off in your head and you realize why your robot wasn't working.
 The most effective way of overcoming failure is to restructure these events as learning opportunities rather than seeing them as an end. It's a part of the success process. Failure is actually not a bad thing, since it can teach us how to be successful. People should welcome times when their efforts don't work. Focus on the positive aspects of your life. After failure, it's tempting to dwell on everything that went wrong. But this overshadows everything that is still good in your life. Instead of thinking about your failure, think about what you still have going for you: a loving family, friends, certain skills you have, and anything else that is positive. By thinking about these positives instead of the negatives, you can work through your failure and set yourself up for future success.
Distract your mind by doing something you love. If it's difficult to stop thinking about your failure, distract yourself. Watch a movie you like, play video games, read a book, play sports, or do anything else you love. This will distract your mind and get good hormones flowing to help you feel better.
Avoid substances. It might be tempting to deal with failure with drugs or alcohol, but they won't help you. You might momentarily forget your troubles, but the problems will still be there when the effects wear off; not to mention you'll have new problems if you make a habit of using substances.
Get help if you need it. If you're having trouble coping with a failure and are feeling depressed, there is no shame in asking for some help. Talk to your parents, teachers, or a counselor at school and let them know how you're feeling. It doesn't make you a weak person to admit that you're going through a tough time. These people can help you see that such feelings are temporary and you'll be able to work through them.
 Oftentimes our goals come from something we're not happy with or something we think can be improved. If you're looking for a goal, start by finding out if there's anything you could improve upon. Think about your grades, batting average, or extracurricular activities; are you happy with where you're at with these, or do you think you could do better at any of them? If you need improvement anywhere, this is a great first goal to have. That way you'll learn how to accomplish manageable goals while also improving an area of your life., Another strategy for developing your goal is thinking about what you are good at. This way, you can further improve an area that you're already strong in. You'll probably find it easier to stay motivated when pursuing something that you already enjoy.For example, you may already be a good track runner. You can run a mile in 5:30, the third fastest time on the team. Since you enjoy track and know you're good at it, a good goal would be improving your mile time. You could set a goal to take ten seconds off your time by the end of the season and work towards that.
 This is an overwhelming question, especially for a young person. But having even a slight idea of what you want to do or where you'd like to be in the future is a great help for you. That way, you can start working early to get experience that could help you accomplish your long-term goals.You may decide when you're a sophomore in high school that your goal is be to become a vet.

 You can prevent syphilis transmission by recognizing the symptoms. Syphilis symptoms include skin ulcers, lesions, and rashes inside or around your genital area. Ulcers and lesions can also pop up around the mouth and lips or inside your mouth.Rashes found on the palms of your hands and soles of your feet are also symptoms. Additionally, you might develop a fever, swollen glands, a sore throat, and feel tired and weak., Unfortunately, if you have caught syphilis or if you had syphilis previously and it has relapsed, you might not know because symptoms do not always surface. Ensure that you do not have syphilis by getting tested for it, either by your usual healthcare provider or a local clinic that tests for STIs.If you are at risk for an infection, it is recommended that you get tested at least once a year, if not twice a year. Also, it is recommended that you get tested with each new partner., If caught in its early stages, syphilis can be cured with the right medicine, usually with penicillin G. Home remedies and over-the-counter drugs do not cure syphilis.Once treated, it is recommended that you abstain from all sexual activities for seven days or until your sores are healed to prevent contracting syphilis or transmitting it to other partners.

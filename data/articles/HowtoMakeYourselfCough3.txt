 This type of device is typically used for quadriplegic individuals who do not have the ability to cough on their own. The device is implanted under the skin near the neck or upper chest, and sends electronic pulses to the neckâ€™s phrenic nerves. This causes the diaphragm to contract, simulating a breath inhalation. Continuing these pulses will cause minor spasms to initiate coughing., A caregiver can help a disabled patient to cough by pressing firmly on the torso just below the ribcage. At the same time, the patient should exhale or try to cough. The pressure should induce a sort of cough that will, for example, help clear lungs during a chest infection.The caregiver must apply very careful pressure so as to not cause injury to the patient.
 Fentanyl is a pain medication administered as an anesthetic by a health care professional. An intravenous injection of fentanyl tends to induce coughing in the patient.,This is only used when a patient is undergoing anesthesia for a medical procedure and would not be a common method of inducing a cough.

, Be generous with the soap if you want a lot of bubbles. The original recipe used 48 pumps of soap!,, You'll want to add about 1 1⁄2 cups (350 ml) of shaving cream, or hold down the button for about 9 seconds., The mixture should be fluffy and liquidy., Start off with one to two drops; if you want a stronger color, then add more. Afterwards, stir until the slime mixture is colored thoroughly with no white streaks., Add about 3 tablespoons (44 ml) at a time, and then mix. Continue adding liquid starch until the slime has clumped up enough that you can't mix it anymore.

Don't add the liquid starch all at once. Otherwise, your slime will harden.
 Once the slime has solidified enough that you can no longer mix it, use your hands to knead it together so it doesn't stick to the rest of the bowl., If you want your bubbly slime to be particularly stretchy, then add a few pumps of lotion into your slime and knead it in. Don't hesitate to be generous!, Preferably, put it in a container that isn't too big - you want your slime to fill up the container, but not be up to the brim., Spray about a cup of shaving cream on top of the slime and use your hands to spread it evenly over the top of the slime. Don't knead it in.,, The slime needs awhile for the bubbles to form. Two days is recommended., Bubbles will have formed on top of the slime, hence the name "bubbly slime".

Wait for 20 minutes if you want crunchy, dry bubbles.
If you don't let the slime dry, the bubbles won't be crunchy. This is a matter of personal preference, but it does give the slime a different texture.
 The bubbles on your slime will have a completely different feel than the rest of the slime and will be fun to poke, pop, and smooth out. Store your slime in an airtight container when finished.

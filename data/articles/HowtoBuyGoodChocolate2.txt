 High-quality chocolate will have a strong, pleasant aroma. A lack of discernible smell indicates old or poor-quality chocolate. Chocolate that smells of anything else means it has not been stored well. Chocolate absorbs the odor and flavor of its environment, so pay attention to whatever is on display nearby.In some high-end chocolate establishments, the owner may allow you to open a bar or package of chocolate that you’d like to buy so that you can evaluate the chocolate. In most stores, of course, opening chocolates prior to purchasing them is discouraged.
 Good chocolate will have a glossy surface. The surface should also be consistent with no blemishes. If the surface of the chocolate you’re inspecting seems uneven or flaky, you’re likely looking at a low-quality confection.If a wrapper is impeding your ability to see the surface of the chocolate, you will have to use one of the other tips on buying good chocolate to help you determine the chocolate’s quality.
 In order to determine if the chocolate is of high quality, you need to break it in half. The action will result in a clean snapping sound in a high-quality chocolate. The chocolate should also break clean and in a straight line.If the chocolate bends or falls apart when you break it, the quality is inferior.
Milk or white chocolates will also often bend, rather than snap, when pressure is exerted.
 A high-quality dark chocolate will have a strong, bitter taste, since it has not been diluted by milk or unnecessary add-ins.Beyond taste, high quality chocolates will begin to melt in your mouth immediately. The texture should be creamy and smooth.


Personal preference also comes into play at this point. The quality here can only be decided by tasting the chocolate to see if it is of the variety you are looking for. Some people like a very dark, bitter chocolate (over 80% cacao), while others like a milder dark chocolate.
Chocolate that is inferior will taste a little off or feel grainy in your mouth.

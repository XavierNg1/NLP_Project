 The difficulty of removing a stain will depend largely on your carpet pile. A high pile may require more than a knife or spatula to remove sauce, and may require a small rag, while a low pile should be just fine with a knife.Make sure all large pieces of food and piles of sauce are gone before moving to the next step, as blotting with a lot of sauce intact may make the stain worse.
 Take a damp, clean white rag and dab at the stain, pressing firmly into the stain. Do not wipe or scrape with a rag, as this can force the food particles further into the carpet and make them extremely difficult to remove.Make sure to use cold water while blotting. Warm or hot water can encourage food particles to set.
 Carpet is not quite as versatile as clothing in terms of stain treatment. Stick to the basics here: peroxide, Dawn dish soap, or a dedicated carpet cleaning product.Apply a capful of peroxide to the area, working it in gently with your fingers. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes.
Place a pea-sized amount of Dawn dish soap onto the stain, and gently rub the soap in circles, using a small toothbrush or laundry brush.
To use a carpet-cleaning product, simply follow the productâ€™s instructions after removing additional liquid.
 While you cannot rinse carpet under running water, you can flush the area out using a small cup of cold water. Gradually pour cool water onto the stain, blotting up excess moisture as you go, and lifting the stain and spot treatment.For a small stain, 1 C (8 oz) of water will do. For larger stains, double the amount.
 To dry your carpet, place a clean towel atop the stain and press down using firm pressure. Continue this process until all of the moisture has been lifted.


Once the stain has been removed, you can turn on a ceiling or floor fan to speed up the drying process.

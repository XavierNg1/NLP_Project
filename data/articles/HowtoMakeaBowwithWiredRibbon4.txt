 Cut the ribbon first, then scrunch down one of the ends until a wire pops out. Grab the wire and pull it out. Leave the other wire inside the ribbon.Discard the wire you pulled out or save it for another project.
For 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) wide ribbon, plan on using 1 yard (91.44 centimeters) of ribbon. If your ribbon is thinner, you could try using less.
 Scrunch down one of the ends of the ribbon until the wire pops out. Gently tug out the wire, then tie it into a looped knot. This will help prevent the ribbon from sliding off in the next step., Go to the other end of the ribbon. Scrunch it down until the wire pops out. Grab the wire, and gather the ribbon down it, towards the knotted end. Keep gathering the ribbon until it is all scrunched down above the knotted end., Starting from the end with the long piece of wire, roll the ribbon into a cone-shaped spiral. The scrunched, wired side of the ribbon will make the bottom/center of the flower. The other side of the ribbon will make the petals., Hold the flower in one hand so that it doesn't unravel. Use your other hand to take the long piece of wire, and push it back down through the center of the flower. This will help hold the flower together and flatten it., Poke the wire through the bottom edge of the flower until it comes out the side. Give it a gentle tug, then thread it back through the flower., If the flower is still loose, tie the long tie to the knotted end of the wire. Cut the wire down using a sharp pair of scissors or wire cutters.

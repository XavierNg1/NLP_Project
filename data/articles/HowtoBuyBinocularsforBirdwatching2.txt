 Use the Yellow Pages. Check weekly flyers. Enlist the help of a search engine. The more searching you do, the more options you’ll find. Each has benefits and drawbacks, depending on what type of binoculars you want and how much you’re willing to spend.
 The Internet features plenty of reviews on birding binoculars, from both expert and amateur birdwatchers. Consulting as many different reviews as possible will often result in the recognition of themes or patterns. Perhaps one brand is consistently more durable than another, or one style is overpriced compared to other models.
 Birding clubs are all over the Internet—and they take their hobby seriously. Find a club or message board devoted to birding, and load up on questions to ask. You may get varied opinions on different products, but the insight should provide you with an expanded knowledge base when it comes time to make your selection.

 As you search for a guardian for your child, consider potential candidates who are financially stable and responsible. You may avoid choosing a guardian who has a high amount of debt, who does not have a steady job, or who does not handle their money well. Ask yourself, will this person be able to support my child financially? Will this person be a good role model in terms of money management for my child?Remember that caring for a child requires a fair amount of money and a steady income. You do not want to burden someone with caring for your child if they are not financially stable. You also do not want to put your child at risk by placing them with someone who cannot provide for them financially.
 Factor in the health of the guardian and confirm that they are in good health. The guardian should be physically and mentally well enough to care for your child and provide for them. You do not want the guardian’s health to put your child in danger or result in your child having to care for their guardian.You should also consider age of the guardian and make sure they are mature enough to care for a child. Having a guardian that is middle aged will ensure they have life experience and are able to conduct themselves as adults. A guardian that is very young may not be as responsible or as prepared to care for a child.
 Consider the guardian’s lifestyle and whether they will have the time and energy necessary to take care of your child. Ask yourself, is the guardian able to fit a child into their existing lifestyle? Does the guardian have the time and energy to devote themselves to raising my child?For example, you may have a close relative who is a workaholic and unable to find enough time to sustain a romantic relationship, let alone care for a child. As a result, they may not make the best guardian for your child.

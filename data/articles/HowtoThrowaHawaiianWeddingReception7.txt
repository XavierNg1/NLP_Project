 Consider menu items like teriyaki beef, kahlua pig, mochiko chicken, huli-huli chicken, mahi-mahi, laulau, lomi lomi salmon, chicken long rice, poi and haupia.


Include tropical fruits from Hawaii, such as fresh pineapple and papaya. The fruit can be cut into cubes and put onto fruit skewers, combined as a fruit salad or even made into a salsa to complement other menu items.
Hire a caterer who specializes in Hawaiian cuisine. Many caterers provide menus specifically for luaus that would be appropriate for Hawaiian wedding receptions.
 Mai tais and blue Hawaiians are popular alcohol drinks at luaus. You also can offer these in a non-alcoholic version, or offer a fruity non-alcoholic punch.

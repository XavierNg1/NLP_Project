 Under Illinois law a tenant’s failure to pay rent within five days of the payment due date is sufficient grounds for eviction. The violation of any specific conditions of the lease can also give rise to grounds for eviction. For example, if the lease agreement has a no-pet clause, the tenant’s decision to keep a dog at the rented property would constitute proper grounds for eviction.


A tenant’s refusal to vacate the premises following the expiration of the lease is also a lawful ground for eviction.;
, Before commencing the eviction process you should attempt to talk with your tenant in order to hopefully resolve the issue without resorting to the courts system. Ask the tenant whether they just need a little extra time to get caught up on rent past due. It may even be a good idea to explain the reason why their acts constitute a violation of the lease agreement, in order to remedy the grounds for eviction. This way you can avoid the costs associated with commencing the eviction process, while also avoiding having to exert the time and costs associated with locating a new tenant.


If you reach any agreements during this informal discussion, you should make sure to get the details of the resulting agreement in writing.
 Send a letter to the tenant reminding them of the different conditions of their lease agreement, and explain how specific violations could give rise to eviction proceedings. State clearly that you expect all of the conditions of the lease agreement to be strictly followed, and should this not occur, you have the right to commence eviction proceeding.

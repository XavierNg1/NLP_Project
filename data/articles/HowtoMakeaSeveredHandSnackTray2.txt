 Slowly add plaster until an island forms in the center of the container.


Wait for the island to sink. Then, mix the plaster into the water with a paint stick.
Test the plaster's thickness by dipping your finger into the mixture. The plaster should coat your finger opaquely, like a cotton glove. Rinse your finger and add a little bit plaster more if the mixture is too thin.
Add a pinch of salt to your plaster mixture. Salt will make it set more quickly.
 Rotate the mold to get a coating of plaster all over the inside. Making a coating like this keeps bubbles from forming on the surface of the hand.
 Overflow the mold with a 1/4" (6 mm) layer of plaster. The overflow will create a round base to support your severed hand.
 Plaster produces a lot of heat as it hardens. When the plaster has heated up and then cooled down, you know that your plaster has cured.
 Gently squeeze the sides to release the mold, but don't squeeze too hard; you might break a plaster finger.
 Be especially careful around the fingers so that you don't break them off.


If you accidentally break one of the fingers, set it aside and continue de-molding the hand.
Reattach the broken finger using a surface-intensive adhesive.
 Allow the plaster to dry completely.

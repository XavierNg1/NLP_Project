Stop answering his phone calls, texts, emails, etc.
Never text or call him. If you are in the middle of a text conversation, randomly stop replying.
Reschedule dates and hang-out events frequently. If he asks you if you’re free, say “I’m not sure, I’ll text you in an hour or so” but never text him back.
When he tries to hold your hand, hold his for a couple seconds, then point to something or fix your hair with the occupied hand. When the hand motion is done, put your hand in your pocket or hold your cell phone or something that prevents him from trying to grab it again.
 If possible, focus on something other than him when he’s there - make an important phone call, catch up on some work, or text other people constantly.
 If you absolutely have to talk to him, act annoyed and do so with as few words as possible.

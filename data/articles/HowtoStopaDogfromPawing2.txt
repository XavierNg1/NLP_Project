 Dogs respond to any kind of attention, even negative attention. If your dog is pawing, the best way to discourage the behavior is simply ignoring it. When your dog paws you, freeze completely and avoid making eye contact with the dog. Do not engage with the dog until the behavior stops.When you initially start ignoring your dog, it will probably paw you harder to try to get your attention. Be patient and do not engage with the behavior. Engaging with pawing after your dog becomes more aggressive encourages your dog to paw.
Ignoring bad behavior is much more effective than scolding your dog, as scolding is seen as a form of attention.
 It's natural for dogs to paw during playtime to an extent. However, unwanted and aggressive pawing should be discouraged. If your dog paws you during play, stop playing with your dog for 10 to 30 seconds. Continue playing once your dog has calmed down and their paws are on the floor. Then, resume playing. If you consistently halt playing in response to pawing, your dog will eventually learn not to paw.Also, keep toys low to the ground when playing with your dog. This will prevent your dog from having to paw to get its toys.
 Remember, consistency is key to cut back on any unwanted behavior. Only engage with your dog's pawing when it comes in response to a specific command, like, "Shake." Responding to any other type of pawing will encourage unwanted pawing., Many people accidentally reinforce pawing without realizing it. Guests, friends, and relatives may be naturally inclined to pet a dog that's pawing them for attention. If you have new people over, politely let them know you're working on discouraging your dog's pawing. Ask them to refrain from engaging with your dog if it starts pawing.

 Make sure that the inside of the diaper is facing you. Do not unfold the adhesive flaps. Try to use a plain white diaper; this way, it will look more like frosting.;
, Keep the folded edge at the top, and the elastic edges at the bottom.
 Try to roll at a slight angle, so that your cupcake will have a nice peak. Make sure that the folded edge is making the peak, and not the elastic edge., Don't worry about what the rubber band looks like. You will be covering it up later.
 If the cupcake is still too flat for you, turn the cupcake so that the bottom, elastic edge is facing you, gently poke the center of the spiral with your finger. This will push the peak out further., You can also use an elastic baby hair tie or headband instead. If the baby shower has a certain theme color, consider using a ribbon that matches that color. You can also use pink if the baby will be a girl, and light blue if the baby will be a boy.


The width of the ribbon does not matter. It should be thick enough to cover the rubber band, but not so thick that it looks out of proportion. Something between Â¼ and 1 inch (0.64 and 2.54 centimeters) would be idea.
 For a more personal touch, match the cupcake to the theme of the baby shower. For example, if the baby shower has a zoo theme, you could use a zoo themed cupcake wrapper. You can use a pink cupcake wrapper if the baby will be a girl, and a blue one if the baby will be a boy.
 This is not completely necessary, but it will give your cupcake a little more color. Don't pin or tape the decoration to the cupcake, as this can rip or tear the diaper when the expectant mother takes it apart. Instead, gently balance the decoration on top. You can also poke part of it into the center of the cupcake spiral to keep it secure.
 A cupcake box from a baker or a tiered cupcake stand would make a wonderful touch!

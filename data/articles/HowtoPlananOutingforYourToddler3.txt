 Toddlers enjoy routines, so it's important to talk with them about where you're going on your outing ahead of time. This will give you a chance to discuss rules and expectations you have for their behavior. It will also get your toddler excited about the outing.For example, you could say, "We'll be going to the grocery store this afternoon to get things for dinner. I want you to sit in the cart while we're there and if you behave, you can pick out a snack."

, Talk with your toddler about the behavior you expect from them during the outing. Don't wait until you're already at the event or activity since your child will probably be paying more attention to their new surroundings instead of you. Let them know any consequences that bad behavior would have and encourage them to behave.You might say something like, "While we're birthday shopping, I expect you to not whine for toys of your own. If you do, we'll have to leave the store. If you behave, we can have a snack once we've finished."

, It's also a good idea to ask for your toddler's assistance and opinion. This can make them more cooperative during your outing since they feel like they have some say in what's happening. Try giving your child a few options and letting them pick one.For example, if you're out shopping for new toddler clothes, ask your child which shirt they prefer. Giving your toddler a couple of choices will prevent them from feeling overwhelmed.
 Avoid only responding to poor behavior. Instead, catch your toddler being good. If you see your child following your directions or not getting upset during a challenging situation, tell them they're being really well behaved. You could also give them a small reward for their behavior.For example, you could say, "I know we had to wait a while to get a table at the restaurant. Thank you for playing and being so patient."

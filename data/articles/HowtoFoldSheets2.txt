 Your arms might not be long enough to hold it taut, in which case you can ask someone for help, or you can place the sheet on the ground, so you can get it flat.
 You'll want to fold it so that the adjacent corners match up and you'll be folding it on the long sides. Smooth the surface once you've folded it to keep wrinkles from forming.
 You'll be folding along the first fold, so that you end up with a long, narrow rectangle. Smooth gain.
 You should really only have to fold your flat sheet 3 or 4 times, depending on the size of the sheet. This time you'll fold the top down and line up the corners. You can fold it one more time, which will give you a more squarish folded sheet.

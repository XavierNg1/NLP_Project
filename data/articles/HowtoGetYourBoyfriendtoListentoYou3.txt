 Look for things that you and your boyfriend have in common, whether it's a place you both visited, a hobby you enjoy together, or a shared love of cats.


Try learning more about his hobbies. Do any parts of them interest you? If so, these would make great conversation topics.
Most guys are not interested in gossip or celebrities. If you are, save those conversations for people who are interested.
 Your boyfriend also has a lot on his mind, and if you are a patient and sympathetic listener, he'll feel that he can turn to you to talk about important things. Validate his feelings and listen closely to what's on his mind.


Take time to hear him out. Don't rush conversation. This will help him feel that he can let it all out, and once all his feelings have been heard, he'll happily grant you time for all of yours.
 Part of helping him feel valued is wanting to hear what he thinks, and incorporating his advice. This can be a simple as asking him whether you should wear your blue dress or your purple dress, or as complicated as asking for advice on dealing with your overbearing father.
 Many boyfriends immediately want to help if they see that their partner is struggling with something. Let him reach a high shelf or help you brainstorm ways to solve a problem. Helping you makes him feel good, and it offers you an opportunity to practice clear communication and ask for what you need or want.


Tell him how specifically he can help you. For example, "I could use help figuring out this bug in my program," or "Please hold this end of the sheet so I can fold it."
If he's busy offering solutions when you aren't ready, try saying something like "I just need to vent right now." This lets him know that the best way to help is to listen.
 Your boyfriend will feel special if he is the first (or one of the first) people in your life to hear your big news.

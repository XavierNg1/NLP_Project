 This displays a popup menu.
 This displays the Insert Hyperlink dialog box.
, What you do next depends on whether you want to hyperlink to a file or to a Web page and where that file or Web page is located.


If the file you want to link to is in the current folder (the same main folder as the Excel spreadsheet you're linking it to), select "Current Folder" from the options under "Look in:" and select the file.
If the file you want to link to is a file you have recently used, select "Recent Files." A list of the URLs to the files you have used most recently is displayed; select the URL of the file you want.
If the Web page you want to link to is one you have browsed previously, select "Browsed Pages." Then select the URL of the page you want to link to. If you do not see the URL for the Web page you want to link to in the list, click the "Browse the Web" button above the list to open your browser and look for it; when you find it, switch back to Excel, but do not close your browser.
If you want to link to a specific location on a Web page, follow the same procedure as above, but make sure first that the location has a bookmark on it. To make the link to the bookmark, click the "Bookmark" button, then double-click the bookmark from the displayed list.
If you know the URL of the file or Web page you want to link to, you can type it in the Address field. (You can also cut and paste a Web page URL from the address field of your browser if it is currently displaying that page.)

, If you want to display a ScreenTip when you rest your mouse cursor on the hyperlink, click "ScreenTipï¿½" and enter the text in the "ScreenTip text:" field of the Set Hyperlink ScreenTip dialog box, then click "OK."

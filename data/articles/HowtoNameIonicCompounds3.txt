 This compound will have more than two ions in it. Let's say you're working with the following compound: FeNH4(SO4)2., You'll have to do some math to find it. First, you know that the sulfate, or the SO4 ion has a charge of -2, and that there are two of them because of the 2 below the parenthesis. So, 2 x -2 = -4. Then, you know that the NH4, or the ammonia ion, has a charge of +1. Add up -4 and 1 and you get -3. This means that the iron ion, Fe, must have a charge of +3 to make up for it and to make the compound neutral.
 In this case you can either write Iron (III) or ferric.
 In this case, you're working with ammonium and sulfate, or ammonium sulfate.
 You can name the compound FeNH4(SO4)2 by either writing iron (III) ammonium sulfate or ferric ammonium sulfate.

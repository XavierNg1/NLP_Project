 Under normal conditions, bromine is a toxic yellow-orange liquid. Alkenes react easily summing bromine to the C-C double bonds originating brominated hydrocarbons which are colorless. On the other side saturated hydrocarbon don't react easily with halogens so it's possible to detect alkenes or compound containing unsaturated C-C bonds by observing a color change in bromine when an organic compound is mixed with it. If the solution goes colorless, presence of double bonds is detected.;
, Remember to wear protective glasses and gloves and to protect your skin form accidental contacts with bromine which is a strong corrosive agent. Don't drink or eat while performing the experiment., Wait while the reaction takes place., If the color is still orange, the organic compound has no C-C double bond in its structure. If the bromine went colorless, the organic compound involved has one or more double bonds in its molecule.

 Does it have a purpose – is it telling a story or are you simply trying to get the sitters personality across?


Perhaps ask the sitters themselves how they would like to be photographed. What sort of mood are you trying to get across? Lively/eccentric/reflective/serious/friendly? Try pulling together a mood board by finding images that you really like.;
, Do you want it to be a square, a landscape or a portrait? How much of the person would you like to show – a full length where the background becomes more important? A half-length, a head and shoulders or cropped even more tightly?

, At the subject's home, in the garden, in the park, on the beach or perhaps in a café? The possibilities are endless. The location can really help to bring out the ‘mood’ and ‘feel’ of a portrait.
 Should it reflect their personality and make a statement? Or should the clothing be subtle? This comes back to the mood and feel that you are trying to establish.
 If you are outside, you could use pure and simple daylight, or you could combine this with a little bit of fill in flash if you're shooting into the sun.  If you’re inside, you can choose between window light, a combination of flash and daylight from the windows or pure flash.
 A shallow depth of field, such as F4, will blow your background out of focus so that the emphasis is on the sitter. Always focus on the eyes, in order to optimise the focal point.
 Even if you would like the portraits to look very natural, you will still need to work on the poses. Try lots of different poses and angles, to see which works best for the sitter.  Some sitters are very natural in front of the camera but most appreciate direction.
 Try to put them at ease to help them feel comfortable. Explain what you are trying to do and keep them involved. Listen to their ideas and work together.

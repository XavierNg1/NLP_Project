 Pour 1 cup (180 grams) of baking soda into a glass bowl. Use a wooden spoon to stir in ¼ cup (75 grams) of citric acid., You will need 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of hydrogen peroxide and ½ teaspoon of while vinegar. Make sure that you use a small spray bottle with a fine mist, otherwise, you risk spraying out too much liquid. Shake the bottle to mix the hydrogen peroxide and vinegar together., Knead the mixture, then spray it again. Keep doing this until the mixture clumps together when you squeeze it. Use about ¾ of the solution and save the rest for later., You can use just one fragrance or a combination of several different fragrances.Try to use something that smells refreshing, such as tea tree, lavender, or peppermint. Be sure to knead the mixture well after you add in the essential oil.
 Pack the mixture into a teaspoon, then tap it onto a baking sheet. The mixture will hold its domed shape. You should be able to make about 40 toilet bombs., This will help them harden further when they dry and keep them from crumbling.Don't get too carried away, however; you only need to lightly mist them, not soak them.
 This will take about 4 to 6 hours.Place the baking sheet some place where it won't get disturbed during this time.
 Plop one into the toilet and let it fizz. After 10 minutes, flush the toilet. If there is any residue, use a toilet wand to scrape it out. Keep the rest of the toilet bombs in an airtight container.

 The LED will light up and stay on. Don't let go of the TV button.
 Continue holding the TV button, and enter the code of your TV or VCR into the remote. The LED will go out during number entry, and turn back on when the last digit is entered.
 The LED will flash and go out if number is entered successfully, or flash four times if it detects an error.



Note: Not all functions are necessarily supported on all models, though the primary functions, such as channel change on the TV and transport controls on a VCR should all function properly.

 Since this is a winter landscape, the ground will be covered with snow.;
,, If you notice, they look like triangles with jagged edges.
 Add a star on each of the trees. Don't forget to put a little bit of snow on the tree.
 Use soft colors like sky blue, and a very pale purple and white for the sky and snow. And, of course, paint the trees green. Use gradients and texture as you wish.

 The first step to dividing a fraction by a whole number is to simply write out the fraction followed by the division sign and the whole number you need to divide it by. Let's say we're working with the following problem: 2/3 รท 4., To change a whole number into a fraction, all you have to do is place the number over the number 1. The whole number becomes the numerator and 1 becomes the denominator of the fraction. Saying 4/1 is really the same as saying 4, since you're just showing that the number includes "1" 4 times. The problem should read 2/3 รท 4/1.
, To find the reciprocal of a number, simply switch the numerator and the denominator of the number. Therefore, to find the reciprocal of 4/1, simply switch the numerator and denominator so that the number becomes 1/4.
 The problem should read 2/3 x 1/4.
 Therefore, the next step is to multiply the numerators and denominators of the fraction to get the new numerator and denominator of the final answer.


To multiply the numerators, just multiply 2 x 1 to get 2.






To multiply the denominators, just multiply 3 x 4 to get 12.






2/3 x 1/4 = 2/12







, To simply the fraction, you need to find the lowest common denominator, which means that you should divide both the numerator and denominator by any number that divides evenly into both numbers. Since 2 is the numerator, you should see if 2 divides evenly into 12 -- it does because 12 is even. Then, divide both the numerator and denominator by 2 to get the new numerator and denominator to get a simplified answer.


2 รท 2 = 1






12 รท 2 = 6






The fraction 2/12 can be simplified to 1/6. This is your final answer.

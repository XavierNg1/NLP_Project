 If it's not possible to get back to the salon, try removing your lashes with lash glue remover. You can find lash glue remover at most drugstores.


If you had your extensions professionally done, ask the technician which solvent he or she uses, and see if you can just purchase it there.
Glue remover is a mild solvent with a smell similar to nail polish remover.
 This can be a delicate process, and you need to be able to see what you're doing. Prepare to remove your extensions by doing the following:


Stand in front of a mirror in a well-lit bathroom. If necessary, bring in extra lighting to prevent shadows cast over your face from interfering with your ability to clearly see your lashes.
Remove your eye makeup. Use a gentle eye makeup remover to wipe away your mascara and eyeliner. You need to be able to see where your real lashes ends and the extensions begin.
 Take the following steps to apply the glue remover and loosen the extensions:


Wet a cotton swab with glue remover. Make sure it's thoroughly damp.
Gently pull down the outer corner of one of your upper eyelids. Close one eye, and using the soft pad of your finger, gently angle the eyelid downward at the outer corner. Your upper lashes should be pointing downward, giving you a better view of the extensions.
Move the cotton swab across your lash line. Work from outer corner to inner corner in small, gentle motions. The remover should start to dissolve the glue.
 After you've been over your lash line about 15 times with a wet cotton swab, grip the end of an extension between your thumb and forefinger. It should fall out easily.
 Once all the extensions are out, do another pass over your your upper eyelashes to clear out any leftover glue.
 Splash some warm water on your face to rinse the glue remover from your eyelashes and eye area.

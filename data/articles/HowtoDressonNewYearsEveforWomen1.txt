 Short skirts are relatively standard for New Year's Eve, but if you feel uncomfortable baring that much skin, stick with a skirt that falls at or just above the knee. Choose a length that makes you look and feel your best, regardless of tradition.;
, Instead of a straight-cut neckline, consider something a little more flirtatious, like a crisscross strap or strapless sweetheart neckline. For a more conservative option, try a festive scoop neck that keeps your shoulders covered but exposes part of your collarbone.
 One-shoulder dresses create a dramatic flair that works perfectly for a New Yearâ€™s Eve party. Moreover, playing peek-a-boo with your shoulders can often look sultrier than keeping both shoulders bare.
 If you feel a little wary about exposing your shoulders or chest, but you have a toned back with fairly clear skin, a daring backless dress might be the perfect option for you. A conservative front keeps things looking classy, while the exposed back shows a tempting glimpse of skin.
 Considering the chilly time of year, you may want to reconsider leaving your legs exposed. Simple skin-tone nylon pantyhose will do the trick, but if you want to make more of a statement, consider a black or patterned nylon, instead.
 Depending on how much skin your dress shows, your shoulders or back may end up feeling cold. Carry a wrap or shawl for when you have to venture outside. Alternatively, a capelet or cape provides you with a little more coverage while giving your look a dramatic twist.

 The amount of water you place in the glass will affect the pitch of the sound that is created. The more water placed in the glass, the lower-pitched the sound. Conversely, the less water placed in the glass, the higher-pitch the sound.


Fill several more glasses of water to replicate several different musical notes. Such glass-based instruments have been in use for many years!More delicate glasses, such as wine glasses, are not ideal for making percussive sounds. They are fragile, and more prone to breaking when rapped with an object.
 Arrange the glasses in a logical musical order. You may choose highest to lowest pitch, lowest to highest, or any order you desire, provided you can remember the order.


Test each glass with a tap from a fork, spoon, pencil, or other implement, as you are adding water. You can pour out or add water as desired to reach just the right pitch.
 Dinner utensils are common instruments used to play the glasses. However, pencils, pens, rulers, or even drum sticks can be used to similar effect.


Take care not to hit the glasses too hard. You can end up cracking the glasses, or even breaking it entirely.
 Fill 6 glasses with varying amounts of water - between three and a quarter inches all the way up to five and three quarters. Label them numerically, one through six. With just these six glasses, you can play some simple tunes.

To play "Mary Had a Little Lamb," tap each glass as follows: 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1.

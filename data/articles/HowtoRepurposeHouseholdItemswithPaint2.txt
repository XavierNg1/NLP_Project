 Use painter’s tape to create designs and then use either a paintbrush and paint for a very specific formation or spray paint to achieve the desired look.


Use upholstery paint when painting carpet (or any other heavy duty fabric) so the paint sets and dries correctly.
Mask stains on carpet by creating darker colored designs over the stain.
 Use upholstery paint on chairs or sofas to not only change the color, but freshen the fabric to make it look like new. Consider going with only a single, solid color for large furniture.


Add design touches by painting pillows or throws.
Don’t forget about the structural elements as well. Chair/sofa legs that are exposed should be either painted or re-stained to complete the fresh look.



Lay curtains completely flat in order to provide you with the “canvas” for your art.
Tape off the design, then carefully apply or roll on the fabric paint. Allow to dry before hanging.
 In a well ventilated area, hit various segments of your silk floral arrangement with new color.


For example, transform a set of old white silk hydrangeas with deep indigo for contrast and a color pop.
Don’t forget about the stem and any surrounding foliage before arrange the fully dried flowers in a vase or bowl.

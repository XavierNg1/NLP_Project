 Whether the person you're encouraging to see a therapist is suffering from a mental disorder, or addiction, or simply going through a hard time, telling your loved one that what she feels is normal is the first step to detaching therapy from stigmas.Remind your friend or loved one that people of their age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, and people with their same struggle can and do attend therapy without stigma or shame.;
, Depression, anxiety, and phobias are all medical problems.Addiction is also, at its root, a medical problem.Try comparing therapy to seeing a doctor for any other medical condition. Ask your loved one, "You wouldn't avoid seeing a doctor for a heart or lung problem, right? So how is this any different?"

, According to recent studies, 27% of adults in America have sought and received some type of treatment for mental health-related issues. That's more than one in four, on average, or about 80 million people.Try saying something like, "I'm here for you, no matter what. I would not think any less of you for needing to get help."

, Hearing you tell her that you wouldn't view her any differently for going to therapy might help reassure your loved one that there aren't any real stigmas attached to therapy.

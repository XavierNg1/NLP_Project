It will take about 200 shakes in order to get the ingredients fully emulsified.
 After you’ve shaken the egg and oil mixture thoroughly, remove the top of the shaker. Pour in the glass of the remaining ingredients that you previously set aside. Place the cap back on your cocktail shaker, and shake again for about ten seconds., After you’ve finished giving your cocktail a final shake, it’s time to pour it into your glass but first, you’ll need to strain it. Some cocktail shakers will have strainers that you can pop over the top. Otherwise, you can strain your drink through a Hawthorne or julep strainer. Then pour it into a champagne flute or a rocks glass and enjoy!

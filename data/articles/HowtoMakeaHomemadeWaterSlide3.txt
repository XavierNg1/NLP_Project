 Add inexpensive dish soap or shampoo to the surface of your slide to make sliding easier and faster. Then turn on your hose or sprinkler to get water flowing down the slide.


Add more of the dish soap/shampoo to the slide periodically to keep it slippery.Keep the water from running down just the middle or one part of the slide by making sure there are no major creases or wrinkles in the plastic, or using multiple hoses/sprinklers.
 Give yourself enough room to get a running start at the top of the slide to gain speed. Then jump on the plastic on your stomach, back, or rear end to slide all the way down.


Make sure to wear a bathing suit or clothing that will slide easily and that you don’t mind getting dirty or grass stained in the event that you slide off the plastic.
It will help to get yourself wet or even lightly covered with the dish soap/shampoo before your first run on the slide for the best results.
 Take down the slide after one or two uses to prevent the death of the grass underneath if that’s a concern. Grass will easily get ripped up by the friction of sliding and/or browned by the accelerated heat of the plastic over it.


There is also the chance of the plastic getting dirty, ripped, or even melted by environmental factors if left out between uses.
If you used pool noodles, simple roll up the slide over the noodles at either edge, removing the stopper noodle if you have one, and fold it at the breaks in between noodles. At the end of the season, you can take all the noodles out to store the slide more compactly.
You should be able to get several uses, even the whole summer, out of your homemade water slide with durable plastic and normal use. This can be a cost savings over store-bought water slides, which often have to be replaced after the first use.

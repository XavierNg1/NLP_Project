 Being active can help you treat mild sleep deprivation. If you engage in a short activity a few times a day, it can help increase alertness. The feeling of being alert may fade fast, so you may have to be active again. If your sleep deprivation is severe, you may feel more tired instead of feeling energized.Try light activity, like a quick walk or other light cardio. Choose an activity that will get your blood pumping, not tire you out.
 Being exposed to light can help you feel more awake. Light causes your body to reduce its production of melatonin, which is the hormone that makes you feel sleepy. Light helps your body's circadian rhythm align with the day-cycle, when we feel awake and alert. Try turning on an overhead light, opening the windows, turning on multiple lights in a room, using a light box, or even going outside into the sunshine.Even if it is the middle of the day, increasing the brightness in your room or office may help you feel more alert and less sleepy.
 Adopting good posture may help you stay up when you have sleep deprivation. When you stand or sit up, it helps engage body functions that help you stay alert. If you are suffering from sleep deprivation, try sitting with as good posture as possible.If you can, stand to help stay awake.
 Caffeine is a common short-term treatment for sleep deprivation. Caffeine is a stimulant that helps increase alertness. You can drink caffeine in coffee, tea, or soda, and it can be found in some foods, like chocolate. Small amounts of caffeine throughout the day works best to help keep you awake and alert.Be aware that caffeine can cause side effects, such as headaches or shaking if you consume too much. Caffeine is not recommend for children and women who are nursing or pregnant.
Caffeine cannot help with severe sleep deprivation. Avoid caffeine at least four to five hours before bedtime.

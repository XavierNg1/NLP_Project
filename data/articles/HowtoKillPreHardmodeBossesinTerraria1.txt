 Once you've obtained six Lenses (their standard drop), find a Demon or Crimson Altar.

Demon Altars are found in the Corruption, and Crimson Altars are found in, well, the Crimson. Find them and craft a Suspicious Looking Eye with the Lenses.;
, Make sure it's not near your regular base. Include nearby (maybe in a small five by five shack):

The Nurse NPC
Chests will several different types of weapons
A Campfire
A Magic Mirror in case things get out of hand
Potions

, It's essential to remember that you must kill the Eye of Cthulhu before morning, or it will despawn.,

The fight itself is fairly straightforward. Always have the high ground (Frostspark Boots, Spectre Boots, Magic Carpet, Rocket Boots, Cloud in a Bottle, etc.), and watch out for the spawned Servants of Cthulhu.
 It suddenly changes forms! Don't panic though.

This form change will be signified by the Eye of Cthulhu spinning very rapidly. However, it no longer spawns Servants of Cthulhu.


A quick way to kill the Eye of Cthulhu is to set it on fire.

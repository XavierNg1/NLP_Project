 One key to any good relationship is respect. You respect your parents by following their rules and being polite when communicating with them. They respect you by allowing you to grow into who you are going to be, as well as by offering correction when you do something wrong.
 Cleaning up after yourself is another way to show your respect. Your parents work hard to make a home for you, and they're probably tired when they come home. You should acknowledge that by not leaving messes around and by cleaning up your room even before you're asked.
 Kids not doing chores on time is a common source of irritation for parents, which is why the phrase "How many times do I have to tell you?" is a mantra for many of them. If you wait until the punishment is imminent, it may be too late, but it doesn't hurt to jump up, grab the garbage bag, and head out to garbage can, even when your parent is already angry.
 You may be tempted to wriggle out of a punishment by telling a lie. However, lies have a tendency to build. That is, if you tell one lie, you'll likely need to tell more to cover up your previous one, which means digging yourself into a deeper hole. Just tell the truth. Express your regret, and accept the punishment if it happens. If your parents found out you lied on top of doing something else wrong, your punishment will be even more severe.
 Do your best, and usually, your parents will understand the grade you receive. If you fall behind, try to catch up. If you fail to study for a test, you won't be able to change the grade you receive. However, if you do flunk a test, you may be able to do a makeup test or extra credit work to change your final score. Most parents will forgo the punishment if you can improve your grade.
 Try not to fight with your parents or siblings, as arguments will land you in trouble. Additionally, yelling will stress out your parents, making them more likely to hand out punishments for minor infractions.

 These days most of us listen to music on computers and digital media players, but you can still curate your favorite music into a compelling mix to share with someone special. The best ways are burning a CD, putting your music onto a small flash drive, or simply sending your tape over the Internet.
 Organize your songs into a playlist and add digital album art. Then burn your CD.



Decorate your CD and CD case. Give your CD case an eye-catching cover and include the track listing on the back.
 Gather the files into a folder on your computer. Rename each one with a number in front of the title to put them in the proper order. Include a .txt or .doc file with any track information you wish to add, as well as your cover art. Drag the folder into your flash drive's icon on your computer.


Since flash drives are usually small, consider putting yours in an envelope or taping it to a card before handing it off. This way you can include some physical decorations or a handwritten note and make it harder to lose.
 Gather your mix into a folder and include track listing documentation and album art. Perhaps compress the folder into a zip file. Use your preferred method to send your file to your mix's recipient.

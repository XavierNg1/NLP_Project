 A big way you can save money on your paleo diet is to avoid eating out and cook at home instead. Cooking at home means you know exactly what goes into your meals and you can be assured it is all paleo. You can also budget out your food more carefully when you cook at home and have leftovers to eat later in the week.One way you can motivate yourself to cook more paleo is to have others over who also eat paleo and cook together. Maybe you have a paleo dinner party once a week where you all get together and prepare paleo meals with a limited amount of ingredients or within a strict budget.
 Another way to ensure you stay on track in terms of budget is to create a paleo meal plan for each week. You may write down what paleo recipes you plan to have for the week and make a shopping list. You could then calculate how much money you are going to spend each week on food based on your meal plan and shopping list.As part of your meal plan, you may try switching up the dishes you make so you get some variety week to week. This will keep your paleo diet interesting and exciting for you palate and push you to make different dishes.
 Though you may already be on a strict budget overall, you may consider trying to allocate more of your monthly or weekly budget to food. Consider where in your budget you can cut costs or shift your costs so you have more money to spend on paleo food. Perhaps you skip your morning coffee at a cafe, eat out less, or spend less on items like clothing.Allocating even a small amount of money extra to your food budget can help make being paleo easier. You may think about the long term benefits of eating paleo and be willing to sacrifice a few things so you have more money to spend on your diet.

 You may be able to steer a possum's attention away from one plant to another. Put plants that possums like to eat, such as eucalyptus, at the edge of your garden. This may keep them occupied enough to keep them away from tender shoots and new growth in your garden., In New Zealand, possums are considered an invasive species. You should trap them and call animal control for removal.That said, possums are protected in Australia. The South Australian government only recommends (humane) trapping when a possum is living in your building.Even then, it may cause the possum less stress to lure it out, then block its access


For example, you could build a nesting box, place some fruit in it, and then place it near where the possum is dwelling. This should lure the possum into the nesting box.
If you do use a live trap, a small amount of honey works well as bait. Use the trap to transfer it out of the building, but not outside of the area. Possums almost always die when relocated., Possums may limit the kinds of plants you can grow in your garden but possums need human help to survive. If you live in Australia, you can help offset the destruction of their natural environment by creating a good location for them to live, including nesting boxes and attractive vegetation.


Possums are considered invasive in New Zealand. Call animal control or the Department of Conservation for assistance in removing them.

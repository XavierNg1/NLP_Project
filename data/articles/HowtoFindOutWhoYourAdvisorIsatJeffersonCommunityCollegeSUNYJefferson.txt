If the email icon doesn't work, your advisor's email will be their first initial and their last name, followed by "@sunyjefferson.edu" (Advisor Jane Doe's email would be jdoe@sunyjefferson.edu)

If you prefer to try to meet with them, or are unable to get a hold of them through email or their office phone, stop by their office.  If they are not in or busy, you can leave a message with the department secretary or in their mailbox.  Generally, your advisor will have a mailbox somewhere near the department entrance.

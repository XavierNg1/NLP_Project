 Insert the outer end of one paper clip over the closed end of a second paper clip. Follow the wire of the first paper clip around until the two paper clips are connected at closed ends. Continue connecting the remainder of your paper clips in this manner until all of them are connected into a long chain. Clip the last and first paper clips together to make the chain into a closed necklace.


You can also use this method to create a paper clip bracelet. Simple use fewer paper clips to create a shorter chain.;
, Cut the paper into 1 in. by 1 in. (2.5 cm by 2.5 cm) squares. Create as many squares as you have paper clips.


Bright foil wrapping paper works well, but you can also use origami paper, construction paper, magazines, or other decorative paper. Whatever paper you use should be fairly thick, however, to minimize the odds of tears or rips.
 Fold the square over the paper clip, gluing the paper together where it overlaps in the back. Continue until all the paper clips have been wrapped.
 Coating the necklace makes it more durable by preventing the paper from ripping and the paper clips from becoming unlinked.
 Wait at least 30 minutes in between each application before using more. Three to four layers of glue should be plenty to protect the chain.

 You want to steer with your heels more than you steer with the rope.
 Use your lower body to maneuver the board, and keep the rope at hip height.


Keep your knees bent as you cross the wake. Make sure that you don't cut hard and then let up. If you do, you'll allow slack into the rope, which can cause you to lose control.To cut heelside: Roll your weight back onto your heels and turn your shoulders and your hips toward the wakes.

To cut toeside: Push your hips over your toes. Avoid pulling in on the handle as you veer in and out of the wakes.

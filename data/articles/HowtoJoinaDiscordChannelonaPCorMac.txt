 You have two options for accessing Discord on your computer:

If you have the desktop app, you’ll find it in the Windows menu (PC) or the Applications menu (Mac).
To access Discord in your web browser, go to https://www.discordapp.com, then click Login to sign in.;
, Servers appear along the left side of the screen. Clicking a server’s icon will display a list of channels on that server.

If you don’t have a server to join, you can find one on a free server list, such as https://www.discordservers.com/ or https://discord.me/.
You can also create your own server.
 To chat with text, select a channel under the “Text Channels” header. To join a group voice conversation, select a channel under “Voice Channels,” then allow Discord to use your microphone (if prompted).

Text channels have a hash (#) symbol before their name (e.g. #general).
To disconnect from a voice channel, click the icon with a phone and an “x” near the bottom-left corner of the screen. It’s right next to the green message that says “Voice Connected.”

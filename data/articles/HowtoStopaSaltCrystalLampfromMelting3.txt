 Salt crystal lamps are supposed to evaporate any water on the surface of the lamp. If it doesnâ€™t evaporate properly, it can start to drip and give the illusion of melting. The bulb should make the lamp warm to touch, but not hot.For lamps 10 pounds or less, a 15-watt bulb should be strong enough. Use a 25-watt bulb for a 10 to 20 pound lamp, and for a lamp more than 20 pounds, use a 40 to 60-watt bulb.
 If your salt crystal lamp melts and drips moisture, check the bulb. If the lamp is melting inside, it may leak into the bulb and cause problems. Notice if the bulb flickers, malfunctions, or gives any other problems., If you are having trouble with moisture on your lamp, replace the bulb. You may not have the correct bulb. Make sure the bulb you are using is a heat-producing bulb. You should be able to buy replacement bulbs that are just like the one that came in your lamp at any home improvement store.If the same thing happens, your lamp may be defective due to damage from the water.

 The side the beater hits should be closer to the ground.;
, In the center, the beat will be the tightest as the air can escape the drum faster this way. Placing it off to the side gives more of a fatter sound; it depends on what you desire.
 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) is recommended. Find a metal can with the same diameter (any can will work, soup, coffee, etc.).
 If you have a gas stove, try using a torch to heat up the edge of the can (this is far more dangerous and is not really recommended). You will have to get oven mitts to hold the can to prevent burning of your fingers as the can will get a bit hot.
 If your can is hot enough, it will cut through your head like butter leaving a nice even edge on the head.
 The circle piece you just cut should be somewhere in the bass drum; pull it out and throw it away.

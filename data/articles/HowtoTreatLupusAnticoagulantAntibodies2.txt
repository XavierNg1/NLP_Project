 Each person is different; therefore, you should discuss the different methods for treating LA with your doctor. He or she can help you determine whatâ€™s best for you. If you are not symptomatic, or if you have never had a blood clot in the past, you may not need any medical treatment., This therapy involves taking blood thinning medications such as warfarin, heparin, or low-dose aspirin, which help prevent blood clots. They work by inhibiting the production of vitamin K (responsible for blood clotting) in the liver. This increases the time the blood takes to clot.During this therapy, the level of anticoagulant in your blood will be monitored to determine how much, and for how long you need to continue the therapy. Some people only need to take medication for a few months, while others may have to manage the anticoagulants for their entire life.If LA is still present after the initial therapy, the therapy is usually continued for at least three additional months before the next testing is done.
If the result of the second post-therapy testing shows that the patient's blood no longer contains lupus anticoagulants, the therapy is discontinued.
 Steroids work by reducing the activity of the immune system. The immune system creates the lupus anticoagulant antibodies, and steroids can be used to suppress their production. If the activity of the immune system is suppressed or reduced, then the level of lupus anticoagulant antibodies will also decrease.Examples of steroids include cortisone, prednisone and methylprednisolone.
 A machine removes the affected plasma and replaces it with good plasma, or a plasma substitute that does not contain the antibodies.


This is also known as plasma exchange.

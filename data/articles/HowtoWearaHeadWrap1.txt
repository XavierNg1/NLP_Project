 You can use a wrap or a scarf. A long, rectangular scarf is the best kind to use for this style. 55 inches long and ten inches wide is a standard size for a scarf. Some of the best materials to use are jersey, chiffon, and viscose. Silk looks nice, but it may not hold as well.They can be purchased at department stores, vintage shops, and at stores that specialize in headwraps., This look works best if you tie your hair in a top knot because the wrap needs to be tied tightly and loose hair will not fit well under the wrap. You do not need to do anything if your hair is already short., Put the center of the wrap at the back of your head. The two ends should be extended past your face. The wrap should cover the entire back of your head. It should not be folded., Use the two ends to tie a knot. The knot should be tied just above the center of your hairline. Once you have tied the knot, pull the ends to make sure it is secure., At this point, the ends should be hanging down on either side of the knot. Fold the fabric until you create an oversized bow with a bow flap on each side. Once you are satisfied with the bow, tuck the end into the bow flaps to complete the look.

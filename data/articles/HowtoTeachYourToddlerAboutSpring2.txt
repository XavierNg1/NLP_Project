 Transfer them into caterpillars or butterflies and paint them with appropriate colors. Use tissue paper, glue, markers, construction paper, and other assorted craft items. Ask them where each one of them spends their time during the Spring.
 Know that you may have to draw a simple test drawing for them or have a prepared printout in front of them. Some suggestions for the season to draw could be:


Trees
Flowers
Sun
Eggs (for Easter)

, Cut out magazine pictures or print online images of animals. Ask your toddler where each animal usually spends its time (such as birds in the air, earthworms underground, and squirrels on land).
 Focus on counting animals, flowers, and other season friendly items out loud.
 Teach them the common Spring colors, such as green, yellow, and light blue. Use these colors in icing or frosting on the homemade cookies you make together.

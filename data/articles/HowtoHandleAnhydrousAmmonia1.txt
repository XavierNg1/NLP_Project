 Anhydrous ammonia boils at a temperature of Â– -28 degrees Fahrenheit (-33 degrees Celsius). To keep it liquid at temperatures above this, it must be stored and injected into the soil under pressure. (Once in the soil, the liquid ammonia turns to gas, releasing its nitrogen into the soil as it absorbs the soil's moisture.) Containers used to store anhydrous ammonia should conform to the guidelines of the American National Standards Unit, with all parts and surfaces able to withstand a pressure of at least 250 pounds per square inch (1724 kilo-pascals).


One cubic foot (28.3 liters) of liquid anhydrous ammonia vaporizes to 855 cubic feet (24,196.5 liters) of gas. Nurse tanks (on-farm storage tanks) and applicator tanks should be filled no more than 85 percent full, to allow for some of the ammonia to vaporize without rupturing the tank.;
, Anhydrous ammonia will corrode metals such as copper and zinc and any alloys that include those metals. Because zinc is used to galvanize steel, galvanized steel containers and pipe cannot be used with anhydrous ammonia.
 This will reflect heat, helping to keep the tanks cooler and the pressure inside them lower. Label nurse tanks with "ANHYDROUS AMMONIA" in letters that are 4-inches (10-centimeters) high on the sides and rear of the tank, with the words "INHALATION HAZARD" in letters 3-inches (7.5-centimeters) high on either side.
 Walk around the tanks looking for defects; you can get a checklist of what to look for from your supplier. Inspect the hoses for bulges, blisters, cracks or cuts, and replace them if you see any slippage around the coupling.


Hoses designed for anhydrous ammonia use should have the words "ANHYDROUS AMMONIA" stamped on them, as well as the maximum rated pressure, the manufacturer's name and dates of manufacture and expiration. Nylon-reinforced hoses should be replaced every 4 years and stainless-steel-reinforced hoses every 6 years, sooner if defects are found.
The pressure relief valve should be replaced every 5 years, sooner if leaks or other defects are found.
Leaks can easily be detected; anhydrous ammonia has a distinct odor easily detectable at 50 parts per million (ppm), enough to drive someone away. A concentration of 134 ppm irritates the nose and throat, while a concentration of 700 ppm leads to coughing and severe eye irritation. Concentrations of over 1,700 ppm lead to serious injury and death, while a concentration 5,000 ppm will asphyxiate someone within minutes.
 You'll need a raincoat and least 2 gas masks with current air canisters. The gas masks will only protect you against low concentrations of ammonia gas; if a major leak occurs, contact your local fire department, which has the training and equipment to deal with a serious leak.

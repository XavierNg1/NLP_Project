 To attain a density of approximately 30 g dry weight per 1 l nutrient medium, the algae are harvested. The first step is the concentration of the suspension on disc centrifuges. The concentrated algae are repeatedly washed with water in order to remove remnants of the nutrient solution and other impurities. To achieve the maximum benefit of the valuable cell contents that are enclosed in a tough cellulose 'coat' (a fitting analogy might be the leather 'coat' of a football), we developed a procedure such that the algae pass through a device in which they are mechanically disrupted.
 The grinding of cells increases two to three-fold their digestibility - achieving values comparable with the digestibility of pure proteins.
 This takes place in spray driers - in which the algal biomass is distributed into micro-droplets whose surface temperature does not surpass 60 °C (140 °F) during the entire 50 seconds for which the drying period lasts. The whole processing procedure is a very gentle one and the dried algal biomass, with the consistency of dried milk powder, thus retains all the valuable components in their original state.

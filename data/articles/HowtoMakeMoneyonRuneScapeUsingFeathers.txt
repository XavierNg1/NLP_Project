 Lumbridge has a chicken coop that is north-west of the castle. Cross the bridge when you leave Lumbridge castle and go past the cow field. Keep following the path until you find the chicken coop to the left of the path.;
, Change your world to the world that has the least members in it. This way, there will be less people to get in your way of killing chickens. You might even be the only person there! It's much easier to work when you're on your own, especially when you're at a lower level.
 You may get bored after a while, but motivate yourself to kill as many chickens as you can. When they die, be sure to pick up their feathers. You don't have to bank your feathers because they stack on top of each other. That being said, if you don't mind taking a few trips back to the bank, raw chicken meat sells for a lot of money along with bones.
 Yes, it may sound like a lot of hard work but even if you sell the feather for just 10gp each, that's 1500gp already. If you have 200 feathers, that's 2000gp, or 2k. It's a lot of money when you think that all you've done is killed a few chickens. And you'll be leveling up at the same time!

, To get there quickly, teleport to Varrock and sprint to the GE (Grand Exchange). Sell all the feathers you have, along with any uncooked meat and bones that you collected. If you did this long enough, you should get at least 2-3k from feathers alone.

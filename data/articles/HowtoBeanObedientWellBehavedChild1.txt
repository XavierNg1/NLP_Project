, Even if you don't feel like doing it, do it cheerfully. It won't be as bad as you think!

, You may not like this, but it's true, you are JUST a child, even if you are intelligent, the adults know more than you, it's not because you're dumb, you're not. It's just because they have been around longer, respect your elders, words cannot describe how important this is.
 If you overhear your mother complaining about having to do the dishes, give her a surprise and do them for her.
 Don't answer back, use bad language, talk about adults behind their back or act bored when they are talking to you.
 Parents are humans too and can make mistakes. Instead of snapping back at them or patronizing them, be mature and try to understand their situation. Ignore the aspects which you don't like and instead focus on what you like in them.
 It is not easy to be parent. As a child we are not even aware of the hard times they may have gone through while raising us when we were infants and toddlers. Recognize their good qualities and appreciate them for all the good they have done for you.
 Treat them as you want them to treat you, do this with everybody. If your siblings are younger, help them. When they want to play with you, play with them (unless you are doing chores or homework; then tell them no politely). They look up to you and admire you so set a good example. If your sibling(s) are older, then respect them and look up to them, they are not your parents, they may not even be adults, but they are your elders.
 They've been doing so much for you!

, Go to bed on time and wake up at a good time on the weekends, like 8 a.m, 8.30 at the latest, six thirty at the latest on a school day.
 Your parents won't be very proud of you if you get bad marks, a B is the lowest grade allowed if you want to be impressive, and even a B isn't nearly as impressive as an A, A* or A+!

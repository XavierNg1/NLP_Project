 Mono is not always easy to diagnose at home. The best way is to look for the following symptoms, especially if they do not go away after a week or two.Severe fatigue. You may feel excessively sleepy, or just lethargic and unable to muster any energy. You may find yourself exhausted after the smallest bit of exertion. This can also manifest as a feeling malaise or general unwellness.



 


Sore throat, especially one that doesn't go away after taking antibiotics.






Fever.






Swollen lymph nodes, tonsils, liver or spleen.






Headache and body aches.






Occasionally a skin rash.

, Because of the sore throat, it is easy to at first think your mono is actually strep. But unlike strep, which is caused by the Streptococcus bacteria, mono is caused by a virus and cannot be treated with antibiotics. Talk to your doctor if your sore throat doesn't get better after taking antibiotics.
 If you suspect you have mono, or if you have figured out that you have mono but symptoms continue for more than a few weeks with rest, you should go see your doctor. Your doctor is likely to diagnose you based on your symptoms and feeling your lymph nodes, but they can also perform a blood test to find out more or less for sure.Monospot antibody tests check your blood for Epstein-Barr virus antibodies. You will get results within a day, but this test may not be able to detect mono during your first week of symptoms. There is a different version of the antibody test that can detect mono within the first week, but it requires a longer result time.
Tests looking for elevated white blood cell counts can also sometimes be used to suggest the presence of mono, but won't actually confirm mononucleosis for sure.

 Back muscles, biceps, shoulders, triceps for upper body workouts that will build endurance with strength should be highlighted. However, high rep endurance is needed for the legs. Combining a maximum repetition of pullups and resting with flutter kicks can improve endurance.
 Bent-over rows and bicep curls, and isolating triceps, abdominals, and the lower back are all great exercise for your swimming muscles.


They should be done with moderate weight and high reps (15-20 per set).
 Secure them to a tree or a door knob. Let the natural resistance work you out the same way water works.


Make sure you secure the band to something really stable. A sudden jolt from something breaking can lead to injury.
 Involving yourself with cardiovascular activities will always help your general health, and actively keeping fit will help your body stay ready for when you hit the water again.

 You want to bat your most consistent base-hit hitter in the lead-off spot. Don't waste this spot on your biggest power hitter. You ideally want people on base when your power hitter comes up. Second slot should go to your second most-consistent base-hit hitter., This is where your power hitter goes. This is the player who consistently hits doubles, triples or home runs. Some may argue you want this batter to bat fourth, to increase the chance of a grand slam with the bases loaded. This mentality can cost you because:


After the first inning, this set-up no longer applies.
You want to make sure your best hitter bats in the first inning. Saving your strongest hitter for the fourth spot could mean that the first three batters get out, and this batter won't get up to bat until the second inning.You need to start collecting runs as soon as possible, and this is the best way.
 For the fourth batter you should place your second-best power hitter. Then you can descend down the slots and fill the next best batter. The eight slot should go to your worst hitter. Then for your ninth slot you should have a speedster who may not be the best at batting.

 Use creative mode, turn cheats "on".
 Maybe tame a pet too, but most importantly build a house.
 Fill them with things like swords, food, and armor. Then make a room of bookshelves, and place an enchantment table to enchant them.


You can furnish your house however you want, too.
 Now you're in survival mode. Go ahead and fight monsters with your enchanted armor and swords. There is much fun to be had when you're already brilliantly prepared.

 Physical therapy is a common treatment for foot drop. During physical therapy, you will be given exercises that work and strengthen the muscles needed to lift your foot and toes. This therapy may be done at home or a physical therapy office.You may be instructed to do stretching exercises as well.
Physical therapy is often combined with other treatments.
This treatment is often covered under insurance, though you may have to pay a copayment.;
, A brace or ankle-foot orthosis is commonly used to treat MS related foot drop. This brace fits around the lower part of the leg and foot. It helps supports the ankle by keeping the foot and ankle in a fixed position.This helps the foot not drop down when you walk.


Wear a sock between your skin and brace or AFO (ankle-foot orthotic) to prevent chafing. You will need to wear shoes that will fit over the brace.
You can get braces that are custom-fitted for your foot and ankle.
These braces are often partially covered by insurance. Check with your insurance company to see what they cover., Functional Electrical Stimulation devices are new devices used to treat foot drop. FES devices emit low-level electrical impulses to nerves in the body that tell the legs to raise the foot. The two FES devices available are WalkAide and NESS L300.These devices are not covered by most insurances.
They are very expensive, costing approximately $5000.
FES devices don’t work for everyone. They won’t work if the MS interferes with the nerves needed to tell the leg to move.
 Sometimes, when people get foot drop, their walking gait is altered. This can cause even more difficulties in walking and lead to tripping or unbalanced muscles. Your physical therapist can identify if your gait is affected and work with you using exercises to correct your gait.

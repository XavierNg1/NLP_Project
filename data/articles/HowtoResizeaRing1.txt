 Soak the ring in a solution of hot water and dishwashing soap. Use a soft toothbrush to brush the metal and any stones set on the ring.


Dry the ring thoroughly before moving on.
Avoid using cleaners with bleach, acetone or chlorine, as these can damage a ring’s metal band.;
, Make sure to use clear silicone, like food grade or aquarium grade silicone. You’ll want the bottom part of the ring to have the thickest application. Unless the ring is very loose on your finger, you should use a small amount of silicone., As the silicone will be directly against your skin, you’ll want to try to smooth it out as much as possible. Run the stick along the inside of the ring until the silicone smooths out.You can use a wet paper towel to clean any silicone that gets on the outside of the ring.
 Depending on the type of silicone you use, this can take anywhere from 24 to 48 hours. Resist the temptation to wear your ring during this time, as it will take longer for the silicone to cure and might dislodge it entirely.If you need to remove the silicone, you simply need to scratch at it with your fingernail.

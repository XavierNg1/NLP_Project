 When it comes to nursing in the United States and a number of other countries (such as Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K.), breastfeeding is not considered indecent exposure. You may freely feed your child and expose your breasts without a cover in public places., If you are worried about judgmental looks or being criticized by strangers, remind others that your baby has a right to eat whenever it's hungry. Stay positive and you can remind them that breastfeeding in public is nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about.For example, if someone tells you to do it elsewhere, calmly say that your baby is hungry and you have a legal right to breastfeed your baby.
 If this is one of your first times nursing in public, bring a supportive person along to put you at ease. Your partner, a friend, or your mother could keep you company and help you feel more relaxed. They may also help by holding the baby while you get ready to breastfeed.


If you have a friend who's also breastfeeding, ask if they'd like to go with you. Having a person with experience in breastfeeding publicly can boost your confidence.
 Set reasonable expectations for yourself. It may take a few times breastfeeding in public before you feel relaxed about doing it. Learn what calms you down and practice it when you begin to feel anxious or overwhelmed. For example, you might find that taking deep breaths or repeating a mantra relaxes you.You'll probably find that breastfeeding in public gets easier once you've done it a few times and made a few adjustments.

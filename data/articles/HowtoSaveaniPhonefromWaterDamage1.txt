 Get your phone out of water as soon as possible. Once you drop your device in water, pick it up quickly. Letting it soak for more than just five seconds could cause serious, unfixable damage.;
, Once you have your iPhone, press and hold the power/lock button on the top side to switch it off to avoid any possible short circuits.
 Wipe off excess water from the body of the phone. Once it’s all dried up, get a hair blow dryer and blow off any water that might be left between the gaps or holes on your device. Do this for a couple of minutes to make sure that you’ve removed any moisture on the outside.


If you don’t have a hair blow dryer, you could try blowing through the gaps and ports of the phone, or leave it at the front of an electric fan for a few minutes to remove any moisture left.
 Take three to five cups of uncooked rice and put inside a plastic bag or a zip lock. Make sure that you have enough rice to submerge your iPhone.
 Make sure that your iPhone is completely covered with rice, then seal the bag of rice with a string or its zip lock. Uncooked rice is good at absorbing moisture. The rice inside the bag will try to absorb any water that may have leaked in the inside of your iPhone, removing any moisture that may damage its circuit board.
 Although rice is good at taking in moisture, it will take time before it can absorb all the water from your iPhone. Leave it for at least two days inside without opening the bag to make sure that your iPhone’s all dry.
 After two days, take your iPhone out of the bag and press the power/lock button to switch it on. You’ll find that your device’s working like nothing happened. Always remember that the sooner you can do the steps above after dropping your iPhone in water, the higher the chance of saving it from water damage.

,,,, If this pane is not showing, make sure you select the event you added by clicking it in the track timeline.



The "Start" and "End" values indicate when the image you added will start displaying and when will it disappear. The time values are relative to the beginning of the video. That is, 0 is the start of the main video, 10 is 10 seconds after the main video starts, and so on.

The "Select the kind of Image you want to add" allows you to select whether you want to add a single image ("Single Image" option) or a slideshow imported from Flickr ("Flickr Slideshow" option). The second option is particularly useful if you are creating the video from scratch, adding an extension to the video, or simply creating a slide-show video.

The "Image URL" field is where you input the source URL of the image. This is used if you are adding an image from the web.

The "Link URL" Field is optional. It is used to make the image a hyperlink. You should enter the URL of the destination of the link here.

The picture-frame labeled "Drag an image here from your desktop." field allows you to upload an image from your computer instead of using an image already on the web. Just drag an image from one of your folders into this box to upload it to the application.

The "Transition" field allows you to set the animation used to show the image when it first appears. Available options are: None (no animation), Pop, Fade, Slide Up, and Slide Down.
 Adjust the event's properties accordingly.

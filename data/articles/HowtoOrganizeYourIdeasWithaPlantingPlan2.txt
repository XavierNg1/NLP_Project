 If you are doing a small garden you can sketch the view from an upstairs’ window. Feel free to let your imagination run wild and don’t worry too much about being accurate at this stage.;
,, You can place these on your drawing as simple shapes.
 If you already have a pretty good idea of what you want, you can sketch your ideas directly onto the photographs; if not; work on a sheet of tracing paper laid on top. These rough sketches will help to prepare a more organized planting plan.

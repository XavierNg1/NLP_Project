 For the cat repellent, you’ll need a glass spray bottle. Add enough water to the bottle to almost fill it all the way to the top.Tap, filtered, purified, and bottled water will all work for the repellent.
Using a glass spray bottle helps keep the repellent effect because the oil is more likely to break down in a plastic container.
 After you’ve nearly filled the bottle with water, squeeze 20 drops of citronella oil into it. Mix the oil into the water by shaking the bottle well.Like citrus and other essential oils, citronella oil has an extremely strong odor that repels cats. It is also effective in keeping insects away.
 Once you’ve mixed the citronella oil and water fully, apply the mixture to any locations that you wish to keep cats away from. You can use it in both indoor and outdoor locations, though it’s important to reapply regularly outdoors if it rains.If you are using the citronella repellent in an area where cats have gone to the bathroom, it’s important to clean the spot thoroughly before applying the repellent.

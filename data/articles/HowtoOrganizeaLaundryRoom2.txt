 If you have cabinets in your laundry room, utilize them to keep laundry supplies out of sight. Try organizing different types of supplies in separate cabinets. For example, place laundry detergent and fabric softener in one cabinet and use a different cabinet for clothespins and delicates bags.
 If you donâ€™t have enough cabinet space to house all your laundry supplies, create more vertical space with a shelf or basket. Try hanging a shelf above the washing machine to store laundry detergent and stain remover. You could also hang small baskets inside a laundry closet to store supplies like dryer sheets and clothes pins.
 Organize items like stain removers, scrub brushes, and laundry pens in a shower caddy. Corralling the items in the caddy will help you stay organized, and make it easier to respond to a fabric first aid incident like wine on a white couch.

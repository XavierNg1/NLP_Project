 If you haven’t used your garden shears in years, and especially if they’ve developed patches of rust, they may be difficult to open. If this is the case, spray WD-40 directly onto the joint between the two blades of the shears. Slowly work the handles back and forth to allow the WD-40 to soak in.If your garden shears continue to not open—or to open only with difficulty—loosen the screw or bolt at the intersection of the blades, and spray some WD-40 between the sections of metal that rub together to lubricate. Screw the blades back together.
 In addition to loosening moving parts that have stuck together, WD-40 can also prevent rust from building up. If you’re worried about unused tools or metal appliances developing rust, spray with WD-40 to prevent the rust from building up. Hold the tip of the plastic extension tube 2–3 inches from the metal surface you’d like to keep from rusting, and coat the metal with a thin layer of fluid.


This is useful for a number of outdoor gardening and lawn supplies. Apply WD-40 to your shovel, rake, hoe, saws and saw blades, as well as any outdoor appliances that are exposed to wet or humid weather., WD-40 is great at maintaining the motion and smoothness of any moving mechanical parts, including the wheel sprockets, chain, handlebars, and pedal mechanism on your bicycle. WD-40 makes several bicycle-specific products for use on various parts of your bike. These include a general de-greaser, chain lubricant, and frame protectant. When possible, use bicycle-specific WD-40 products on your equipment.These products should be available at your local bike-supply shop, a hardware store, or from various online bicycle-focused retailers.

, If you're going to get your child a cell phone, consider the features of the phone. Does your child want a camera phone? Do you want one with GPS tracking? Do you want a 2-way radio?

, These phones can run out of minutes without charging extra. When they run out, you have to buy more minutes to start using them again. Some phones require you to buy more minutes by a certain date or the phone will not work. These phones aren't for avid talkers, and are best if you only want a way for your child to communicate with you or family members only.
 This is a cell phone designed for children ages 8-14. This phone has a phone book button instead of numbers. Parents can pre-select phone numbers for the phone book.

 Remember, if you had given a cell phone to your child on his/her 15th birthday,you will have to give your other son/daughter a cell phone on his/her 15th birthday.

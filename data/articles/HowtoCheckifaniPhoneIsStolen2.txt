 Open the iPhone’s dial pad, and enter *#06#. The device’s IMEI number will display automatically on the screen. Write it down.
 Open any web browser on your iPhone or on a computer, and go to “icloud.com/activationlock”. The Check Activation Lock Status page of iCloud will load on the screen.
 On the page, you will see a field for “IMEI or Serial Number.” Tap this and type in the IMEI number of the iPhone.
 Before you proceed, type in the Captcha code you see on the page in the box provided. Then click “Continue.”


If the iPhone is not locked, it will show you “Activation Lock: Off,” with the device’s name and its IMEI number below the status. This means that the iPhone is clear to use.
If the iPhone is locked, it will show you “Activation Lock: On,” with the device’s name and its IMEI number below the status. This does not necessary mean that the iPhone is stolen; perhaps the previous owner forgot to deactivate the lock. If this is the case, proceed to the next step.
 If you know how to contact the current owner (i.e., the person offering to sell you the iPhone), then ask him/her to access Find My iPhone and use its feature to erase the data on the iPhone so that its cleared and the Activation Lock status will change to OFF.


Accessing Find My iPhone requires that the owner enters the password of the Apple ID connected with the iPhone. If the current “owner” of the iPhone cannot do so, it’s possible that the device is stolen.

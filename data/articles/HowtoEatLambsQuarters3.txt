 In general, it’s safest to harvest lamb’s quarters in secluded, out of the way areas. Plants that have been treated with pesticides or smothered with fertilizers may contains traces of toxic chemicals that can be harmful if ingested.Stay away from plants on or near commercial or residential properties, including yards, gardens and roadsides.
 Place the leaves in a colander and run them under a stream of cool water, tossing them by hand occasionally. For a more thorough cleaning, let the lamb’s quarters soak in a shallow bowl of water for several minutes. Swish the leaves around to loosen any remaining dirt and debris.The leaves of young lamb’s quarters are coated in a fine powder-like substance which wards off insects and allows the plant to retain water. It’s important that you completely wash away this powder before eating the leaves.If you plan on cooking with the greens right away, press them between layers of folded paper towels to absorb excess moisture.
 Lamb’s quarters can be preserved like other similar greens. The best way to do this is to wrap a bundle of rinsed leaves in a damp paper towel, then insert the bundle into a plastic bag and stick it in your refrigerator’s crisper drawer. The less time the leaves spend exposed to air, the longer they will last.When stored properly, fresh lamb’s quarters leaves should last 3-5 days before they begin to wilt.Preserve cooked leaves by transferring them to an airtight Tupperware container and refrigerating them. Try to use up the leftover greens in 2-3 days.

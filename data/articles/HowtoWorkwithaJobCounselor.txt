, The job counselor is there to help you and hopefully help you with advancing your career.
 Don't just go to their office and listen to them. That won't get you anywhere. More than likely, that is what you have been doing.
 Don't be under the misconception that you will go see your job counselor and you will have a job. It doesn't work like that.
, Put some thought into it. If you don't know what you want to do or not to do, all you are having is a conversation. The counselor will help you focus, but you have to have something to focus on. Write it down in a notebook. In fact, dedicate a notebook to that.
 Action, or inaction, will make or break your success.
 You won't advance if you don't challenge yourself, at least a little bit.

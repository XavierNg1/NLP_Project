 Make the choice to decide to commit to yourself, your goals, and your dreams. By committing to yourself, you will be able to believe in your worth. If you do not believe in yourself, then you will attract others who have the same problem.Make a list of your strengths, gifts, talents, and positive attributes. Post this list somewhere, like on your fridge, bathroom mirror, or bedside table, so you can remind yourself every day that you are worthy and capable of achieving your goals.

Engage in positive self-talk. Switch negative thoughts like, “I can’t,” or “I’m not worth it,” to “I am smart and I can do it,” and “I am worth it.”

, Try not to hold grudges. Holding resentment toward others or yourself creates negative energy. Forgive those who have hurt or betrayed you, and forgive yourself for your mistakes and weaknesses. Instead, learn from these difficult experiences and allow yourself to grow. Let negative memories go, and replace them with positive ones.Remember that the more you forgive, the more positive energy you will create, which will attract positive and supportive people into your life.
Letting go of toxic people doesn't mean you hate them or no longer value them. It just means that you have chosen to put some distance between yourself and them for now.
 If you find yourself in a negative situation, try to stay positive. For example, if you find yourself in a room full of coworkers who are complaining about their jobs, take a deep breath. Then, try to switch the conversation to a more positive one by finding reasons why you like your job.This is a great way to attract more positive people into your life.

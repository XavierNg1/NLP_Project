 Mash it with a wooden spoon or a whisk until very smooth in a bowl.


Many children love mashing banana. If you have children, ask them to help with this step!;
, Aim to have no banana lumps as a rotary whisk (see the "things you need" section for an image of a rotary whisk) may remove most lumps, but lumps of banana can make it harder to use a straw when drinking.


Aside from vanilla icecream, Chocolate is a great flavour, as well as other fruit ice creams or gelato that would work with banana.
 This will make a fairly thick milkshake, so you can add more milk and desired sweetener to balance it out to a preferred consistency. Older fashioned milkshakes appear to favour a high milk and sugar ratio to icecream and fruit to make an easy to drink consistency and was shaken with the aim to get a big head of foam when poured in the glass (a bit like an iced cappuccino in concept). More modern recipes seem to favour the "thick-shake" cream like consistency, so its easy to make this to suit both styles.
 You can also use container with a tight seal (such as a large jar or other storage container).


Cocktail shakers or a large jar make the best milkshakes, after all, while the "milk-bar" age was when power blenders were mainstream, they had to use something before electricity was available and most bars would be incomplete without a cocktail shaker. Further to that, shaking or churning milk in a jar is an age old way to make butter.
 Shake again briefly to mix. It's easiest to add extra ice cream, honey or other syrups which mixes in smoothly, as sugar can stay powdery or gritty in a thick, cold liquid which already contains some sugar.
 You may pour the milkshake through a sieve if you want a super smooth milkshake but that does add to the washing up, something less desirable on a hot day!

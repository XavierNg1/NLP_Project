 One inevitable reason that your horse will die is from old age. When horses reach the age of 25 years, their health meter will start depleting. After this point, your horse is on borrowed time.;
, Your horse can die either from being too fat or too thin:

Avoid allowing the horse to become too fat. If you're feeding your horse too much, than you're meant to, the horse can die from becoming too fat.






Avoid starving the horse to the point of becoming too thin. If you don't feed or forget to feed your horse enough, it can get too thin and die.
 Not being looked after properly (neglect) is a reason for the death of some horses on the game. Make sure to look after your horse perfectly. If your horse's energy/health drops to zero, when your horse ages, the horse will die.

 A sedan or small car probably shouldn't be used to tow an SUV or large pickup.;
, In a pinch, a chain can be used to tow a vehicle a short distance, but this can be dangerous, as chains do not stretch, and links can break during towing. A nylon or polyester strap with manufactured end loops is better for safely towing.
 A bumper hitch with a trailer ball will work for the tow vehicle, but hooking to the car to be towed can be tricky, since suspension components are not designed for pulling pressure, and other metal components can cut or pinch your strap. Ideally, a rounded frame member or front bumper support can be used for your attachment, but these vary considerably between vehicles.
 If the vehicle is equipped with power brakes and steering, their use is limited if your engine will not run while being towed. In this case, renting a dolly is a better option.
 Plan an exact route, and try to choose one that avoids congested traffic areas or high speed roads.
 Hold the foot brake lightly to prevent the vehicle from rolling until the slack is taken up from the towing vehicle.
, Brake slightly if the towing vehicle slows, or starts down a hill where your speed may cause you to begin to overtake him. Slack in the tow line while travelling can result in a serious jolt if the vehicle pulling your speeds up suddenly. By keeping the tow line tight, this risk is greatly reduced.

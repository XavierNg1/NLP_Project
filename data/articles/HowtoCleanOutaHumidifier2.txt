 Pour a gallon of water and a teaspoon of bleach into the water tank. Let the solution sit in the tank for an hour to completely sanitize the inside of the tank. Pour out the solution and rinse with clean, cold water.


Be sure the tank has been thoroughly rinsed before you replace it on the humidifier frame.
Don't let the bleach sit in the humidifier for more than an hour, or it could damage the machine.
 Pour a few cups of peroxide into the water tank. Swish it around so that it covers the bottom and sides of the tank. Allow the peroxide to sit in the tank for an hour, then pour it out and rinse the tank with cold water.
 Fill the water tank with a cup of vinegar and a gallon of water. Plug it in outside and let the humidifier run for an hour. After an hour, pour out the remaining liquid from the tank, rinse it with clean water, then fill it with clean water and run the humidifier for another hour. Rinse out the tank one more time before using.


Don't run the humidifier indoors when you're using vinegar in the water tank. It will make your home smell like vinegar.
Don't use bleach or any other chemical to do a deep clean through the working part of the humidifier. Turning the humidifier on and running chemicals through the system could cause permanent damage.

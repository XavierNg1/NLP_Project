 It's a great option if you'd like to freshen up your house before guests come.


The smaller the saucepan, the better. Your fragrance will be more concentrated this way.;
, If you are using a larger saucepan, you may want to double or even triple the amount of vanilla and cinnamon. For another layer of fragrance, add 6 whole cloves., The boiling allows the spices to release their fragrance, while the simmering will keep the mixture hot and fragrant. The mixture will lose its fragrance if it gets cold.
 If the water evaporates, your pot will scorch! You do not need to add any additional herbs to the saucepan.
 This fragrance is only temporary, but you can still make it look prettier by putting it into another (heated) container. Boil the mixture first, then try one of the following:Pour the mixture into a 2 cup (475 milliliter) mason jar, and keep it (uncovered) on top of a candle warmer.
Pour the mixture into the bowl of a fondue pot or a tea pot warmer. Light the candle beneath the bowl, and enjoy the fragrance.
Keep the mixture heated in a slow-cooker if you don't wish to use your stove. Keep the lid off and the heat set to low.
 You can reuse it 2 to 3 more times. After that, the scent will be too weak, and you will have to make a new one.

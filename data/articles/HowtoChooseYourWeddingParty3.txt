 Think about potential conflicts and drama beforehand. Factor in your and your fiance’s family dynamics into the decision. Make no mistake that this decision is about you and your partner--if you want to have a small wedding party, have a small wedding party. Don’t feel obligated to invite everyone who expects to be invited or invite everyone your parents want you to invite. Keep in mind that this is your day. There is no right or wrong way to have a bridal party., If you’re a bride, your “maid of honor” can be a man, and vice versa. You can have two maids of honor. You can have a maid and a matron of honor. You can have no best man. There’s no wrong way to do your wedding, so you should go with whatever feels right for your particular situation and wedding.
 Budget is an important part of any wedding and wedding party. Will your bridesmaids pay for their own dresses? Are groomsmen responsible for renting their own tuxes? Will you be able to help out with any part of the finances? Who will pay for the bachelorette party? Think about these issues with your partner, and communicate them clearly to your wedding party. They should know exactly what they will have to pay for before they sign on to be members of the wedding party.
 Do you want ushers? People to hand out programs? A ring bearer? A flower girl? Someone to do a reading at the ceremony? All of these other roles must be decided and determined by you and your partner. Think twice before you give people jobs like being an usher or someone who hands out programs--it could be seen as a favor instead of an honor.Don’t feel like you need to have a ring bearer or a flower girl. Have these positions only if you know of any children who would like this job.

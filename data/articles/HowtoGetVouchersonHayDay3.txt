 Hay Day rewards players that constantly play the game. Open your Hay Day game daily and the Wheel of Fortune will appear during your very first open for the day.
 Select the “Spin” button on the lower right-hand corner of the Wheel of Fortune window to spin the wheel. Wait for it to stop to find out your prize.
 If the arrow of the wheel lands on the voucher (coupon) icon, then you get to win a voucher. The amount of vouchers you can win depends on the prize available for that day.


If you didn’t get a voucher, open the game again the next day to spin the Wheel of Fortune—you just might get lucky!

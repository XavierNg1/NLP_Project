 You should never attempt to pick up a venomous snake under any circumstance. If, however, you're absolutely certain that a snake is not venomous, it may be safe to catch the snake by hand.Never attempt to handle any snake you cannot identify with 100 percent certainty.;
, If you're intent on picking up a snake that you've confirmed is not venomous, you should wear a thick pair of gloves (sturdy garden gloves may suffice).Just because the snake's bite will not kill you doesn't mean you should chance getting a painful bite.


Even a non-venomous snake's bite can be dangerous. All snakes have bacteria in their mouths which, if you are bitten, could penetrate the skin and lead to an infection., As you approach the snake, you should distract it to ensure that it will not turn and strike you. Try to distract the snake away from your reaching hand with a long, sturdy object, like a long tree branch, a wooden yard stick, or a household fire poker.Keep the tool low to the ground and near the snake's head. This should distract the snake, as it will think the object is a potential threat.
 Using your other hand (which, again, should be gloved), grab the snake's tail and lift it quickly. You should keep the majority of the snake's body flat on the ground until your grip is secure. Then you can use the long tool to lift the front part of the snake's body.Alternately, you can drop an old shirt, towel, or thin blanket over the snake, scoop it up in the fabric, and gently drop the whole bundle into a pillowcase. You can then relocate the snake to a safe outdoor area away from people. This method is more dangerous, though, since you cannot see where the snake's head is, and it may bite you through the fabric.
If using a pillowcase, gently shake the pillowcase by the opening to ensure the snake is at the very bottom. If you must set the snake down, be sure you either twist the opening or flip it over on top of the rest of the pillowcase so that the snake cannot easily escape.

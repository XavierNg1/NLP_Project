 Teachers expect students to arrive to class on time and ready to learn. When you arrive after the bell, your tardiness may disrupt the teacher’s routine and/or distract your classmates. Increase your teacher’s frustration by:


Talking to other students on the way to your seat.
Asking, “Did I miss anything important?”
Saying, “We don’t do anything in the first five minutes anyways.”
Asking to use the restroom as soon as you sit down.
Don’t come to class late every day. You will quickly surpass the number of tardies allowed at your school. , Teachers establish elaborate bathroom procedures to prevent students from leaving class at inappropriate times. Blatantly ignoring their restroom rules is a great way to get under their skin.


Limit the number of times you do this to avoid repercussions.
Ask to use the restroom immediately after class begins or right before the bell rings.
Ask to use the bathroom in the middle of a lesson.
Ask to use the restroom while your teacher is giving instructions.
Fill out your pass incorrectly., Pencil sharpeners make loud, irritating noises—it is really difficult for students to hear a teacher over the deafening noise of the pencil sharpener. Annoy your teacher (and a few of your classmates) by sharpening your pencil while your instructor is talking.


Take your time sharpening the pencil. Pull it out of the pencil sharpener frequently to check its level of sharpness.
Before returning to your seat, accidentally “break” the pencil so that you have to sharpen it again.

 To make sure that your oven is hot and ready to bake the chicken, start preheating it when you are ready to start seasoning the chicken.
 Remove the legs from the package and wash them thoroughly under cool, running water. Remove dangling pieces of fat or skin.


After you have washed the meat, dry the meat with paper towels. This will help the flavors cling to the meat, and allow the skin to get crispy when cooked.
Set the meat on a plate until you are ready to move on to the next step.
 Place butter in a saucepan over medium heat. After the butter has melted, add the cayenne, black pepper, salt, and lemon juice, and stir to combine. Remove the mixture from heat.
 Using a pair of tongs, place each piece of chicken in the butter mixture one at a time. Swirl each piece around until it's fully coated. Place the chicken pieces in a metal or glass baking pan.
 Put the chicken in the oven and set a timer for 30 minutes. Check the chicken after 30 minutes. It should be ready when the skin is crispy and golden brown, or when the internal temperature has reached 180 degrees. Use a meat thermometer to check the temperature., Serve with mashed potatoes and a salad, or the side dishes of your choice.

 Wet a corner of the cloth with rubbing alcohol and blot the ink stain. It's imperative that you do not scrub the stain -- that will exacerbate your problem. Dab gently at it, absorbing it up into the fibers of your cloth.


Start at the edge and work your way to center, preventing the stain from spreading and become a larger problem. Work in a clockwise twisting motion with your rag.;
, Get comfy, because the alcohol needs to sit on it for about 30 minutes.It needs to literally eat it away, which can take time. Keep at it!

, A quarter cup of vinegar for a quart of warm water is a good ratio (that's 1:16). The rubbing alcohol may dry out your carpet, depending on its texture, so it's a good idea to give it this rinsing.


If the stain is gone, rinse finally with clean water and let dry. Vacuum the area if the fibers are a bit wonky.
 Let it sit for 15 minutes. When the clock is up, scoop it away and blot with the aforementioned vinegar and water mixture.


By now, the stain should definitely be gone. Rinse it with plain water and marvel at your spotless carpet!

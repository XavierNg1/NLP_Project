 He or she will be able to lay out the possible options—cerclage, a pessary, and bed rest—and tell you which ones would best for you. Keep in mind that a cerclage (suturing the cervix closed) is by far the most common treatment, and allows many women with previous histories of miscarriage to successfully carry a baby to term. A pessary, similar to the outer ring of a diaphragm, changes the angle of the cervix and reinforces it., With ultrasounds every two weeks during the second trimester of your pregnancy, the doctor can monitor the risk of an incompetent cervix. If he or she sees warning signs, then you can have a cerclage., Once you are diagnosed with incompetent cervix, your doctor will likely suggest a cerclage. A cerclage is a procedure in which a stitch is placed around the cervix and tightened to keep the cervix closed. There are five types of cerclage that can be performed, and your doctor will determine which type is best for your situation depending upon how far along you are in your pregnancy.


A cerclage is usually removed near the end of pregnancy to permit normal delivery.
Occasionally, depending on conditions that are present during the pregnancy, the cerclage will be left in place and the mother will undergo a cesarean section to deliver the baby., A pessary is an apparatus that is positioned within the vagina to help raise up and reinforce the cervix. This may be used instead of, or in conjunction with a cerclage., Bed rest may be prescribed by your doctor for an incompetent cervix. Bed rest restrictions can vary from simply avoiding any heavy lifting or housework, to total bed rest where you must remain in a reclining position at all times, including for bathing and going to the bathroom.Talk to your doctor about whether or not some type of bed rest might be a good option for you.


You may also need to abstain from sex during a period of bed and pelvic rest.

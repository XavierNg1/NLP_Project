 Exposing scars to the sun can cause them to darken and slow the healing process. This is because ultraviolet rays stimulate the pigment-producing cells in your skin, leading to further discoloration. To avoid this, you should wear a sunscreen everyday, summer or winter.


Before heading outdoors, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher that contains the ingredient zinc oxide. Reapply after swimming, sweating, or after more than 2 hours in the sun., Exfoliating your skin on a regular basis can help your acne scars to fade naturally, by removing layers of old, blemished skin to reveal the fresh new skin underneath.


Try an over-the-counter exfoliant, containing the active ingredients AHA or BHA, which have strong anti-inflammatory properties and can help with discoloration., It's tempting to try abrasive scrubs and all sorts of irritating treatments in a desperate effort to get rid of acne discolorations, but irritation only causes more harm, which impedes your skin's ability to heal itself. Stick to gentle, non-irritating skincare which is kind to your skin.
 Scars are made up mainly of collagen, and are the body's way of healing itself. However, by picking or squeezing pimples, you cause pus and bacteria to filter deeper into the skin, damaging your skin's natural collagen. Picking also leads to skin damage and inflammation, which delays the healing process. Avoid picking or squeezing spots, and eventually the collagen-based scars will disappear on their own., Drinking water is not going to get rid of acne scars on its own, but staying hydrated is essential for healthy skin and will help to speed up the skin's natural rejuvenation process. Try to drink 1–2 liters (0.3–0.5 US gal) of water a day and eat lots of fresh fruit and veg.

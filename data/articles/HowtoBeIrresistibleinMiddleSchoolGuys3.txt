 That is just going to make the girl hate you, and much less want to date you. Be kind to everyone, even if the favor isn't returned. It'll become a habit, and you'll feel better as a person.
 Even if you aren't theoretically dating the girl, give her small things. I used to give a girl I liked a small portion of my lunch. If you feel the need, get her flowers, a drink, or something similar.
 Use your manners, hold the door open for her, say please and thank you, things of that nature. A respectful man is an attractive man.

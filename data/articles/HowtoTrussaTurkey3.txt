 With the turkey lying on its back, slide the twine underneath the turkey and work it to the middle of the turkeyâ€™s back, half way between the legs and wings.You can draw the ends of the twine up and match them to be sure the twine is centered.
 Grasp the twine on each side a couple of inches from the bird and slide it up under both wings until it is snug in the armpits., Be sure the neck flap is covering the hole at the top of the turkey. Draw the twine together across the neck flap, holding it in place. Cross the strings one on top of the other and pull tightly., Pull both sides along the outside of the turkey breast, staying on the inside of the wings and legs. Cross the strings under the bottom of the rib cage and pull the ends tight., Maneuver the twine under the top portion of the turkey legs, or drumsticks. Wrap the twine around back of the leg, then back over the top at the leg joint. Cross the twine, then pull the ends back under the turkey legs. Pull the ends outward to tighten the twine and elevate the legs.This style of trussing will hold the legs straight out from the body of the turkey. This allows the heat to flow around the legs, cooking them more evenly than traditional trussing. The traditional style presses the legs against the body of the bird, cutting off the source of heat to the inside of the leg.
 Flip the bird on its stomach. Pull the skin flap at the bottom of the bird over the cavity. Wrap the twine around the tail and tie it off in a knot.Trim any excess kitchen twine using kitchen sheers.
Cook the turkey on its back with the legs elevated off the pan.
The indentations of the twine are helpful guides for carving the cooked turkey.

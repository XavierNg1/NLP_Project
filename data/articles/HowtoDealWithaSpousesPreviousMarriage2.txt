 You cannot change that your spouse has an ex-partner. Even if you're in a situation where the ex is being uncooperative, accept that there's nothing you can do. Just try to ignore them and stay pleasant whenever you're with them.The best way to combat immaturity is by ignoring it. If they don't get a reaction, then they are likely to give up.
 It's likely that your spouse wants to move past the choices they made, so dwelling on the past relationship will never help. If you nag about the ex, it might be an unhealthy stumbling block. Leave the past behind you. Focus on forming a more positively-oriented future belonging to both of you.Focus on making your time together meaningful and good, so that your positive memories start to crowd out the ex memories.
 Focus on the present and your marriage. Be grateful that you and your spouse found each other. Be glad that you are both happy. Don't think of yourself as the "second wife" or the "third husband". You are simply your spouse's husband or wife, and they are yours. It's as simple as that.Keep it simple and sweet and you'll keep your marriage a happy and enduring one.
Remember, it took your spouse’s entire life’s worth of experiences to bring you two together. Be grateful for every single experience in their past because it all led up to you two being together.

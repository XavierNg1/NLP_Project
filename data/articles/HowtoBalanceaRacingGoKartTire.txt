 Spin wheel lightly and allow it to stop on its own.;
, You have now determined the lightest point of the the wheel.
 Try to get weight as close to the outside of the rim as possible. Now turn the wheel until weight is at the 3:00 or 9:00 position.
 If weight falls to 6:00 position then you need to remove some weight. If weight goes to 12:00 position then more weight needs to be added.
 This has been achieved when weight can be placed at any position and the tire does not move.
 Apply a small piece of racers tape over weight to insure it doesn't move. You have now balanced your first racing go kart wheel.

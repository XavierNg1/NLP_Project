 Is he just tired? Does he always act this way but you never really noticed? Find out if he is really upset so he won't get confused.;
, Is it something to do with the relationship? Is it a family problem? Is he stressed out from school or work? Figure out what's bothering him so you choose the right approach and solution.
 Sometimes just a friendly smile can brighten his day. Don't be offended if he says something like "why are you so happy?" that just means you need to care for him even more. Also hugs can comfort.
 Sometimes he will just need to work things out on his own. Walk away for a while but make sure he knows you're there for him and will talk if he wants.
 You don't want him to confuse caring with nosy.
 Don't make excuses for anything he says and don't bring up problems from either one of your pasts. That is unless his current problems are related to the ones in the past.
 Be willing to sit with him and let him vent. Whether or not he is crying or yelling or being silent. Sit with him until he's calmed down and ready to talk. If the situation is appropriate and/or you are both really close, hold him tightly and whisper "it's ok. I'm here." or make shushing sounds.
 He will feel better if he knows you don't feel awkward so get close to him.
 If it's true (and only if it's true) tell him you love him.

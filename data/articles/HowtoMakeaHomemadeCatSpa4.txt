 If you’ve never done it before, it’s a good idea to observe someone else do it first. Ask at the veterinarian's office if you can watch someone. For some cats, a scratching post will be enough work for their nails that you don’t need to clip them. For most cats, however, nail clipping is an essential part of their grooming and care. Make sure your cat is in a happy and even sleepy mood before beginning. Cuddle and scratch your cat to get her ready. Some cats dislike getting their nails cut and might need to be wrapped in a towel so that you can complete the task., Cats need clippers specific to felines, available at pet stores. You might want to put a drop of baby oil on the nail so that you can see its length better. You don’t want to cut it too close to the quick, which will bleed if cut., Holding onto one paw, place your index finger on the pad on the bottom of the paw connected to the nail you want to clip. Put your thumb on top of the same area. By gently pushing with your index finger and thumb, the nail will come out (they typically retract in, so you need to get it out enough for you to cut it). Cut the nail just above the pink area (called the dermis or quick).
 For a job well done, give your cat a treat or toy. Play with your cat to reinforce good behavior. Try to start clipping his nails when he is young so that he gets used to it early and it becomes normal.

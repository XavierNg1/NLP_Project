 This method is best used to bleach the last traces of stain after you have removed the majority of it with other methods. Hydrogen peroxide can be found at most drug stores, although you should check the labeling to make sure it is a 3% solution. Weaker solutions (lower percentages) will not be as effective, while stronger ones could damage your carpet.
 An old bottle of hydrogen peroxide may have lost its potency, breaking down into water and oxygen. Pour a small amount onto your sink basin; if it fizzes, it is still effective., Apply just enough hydrogen peroxide to wet the stained tufts of the carpet. You may wish to use a clean, dry cloth or sponge to apply this, as pouring by hand could result in applying too much and bleaching unstained carpet as well.
 The hydrogen peroxide should lightly bleach the carpet tufts to hide the remaining traces of stain within one hour. You may add additional hydrogen peroxide if you see improvement, but the stain is not completely gone. There is no need to rinse the carpet afterward, since the hydrogen peroxide will break down into water.

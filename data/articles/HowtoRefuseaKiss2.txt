 Try not to flirt in a suggestive way. If you don't want someone to try to kiss you, then be very careful about how you interact with them. In general, a person will be more likely to try to kiss you if he/she thinks that you want to be kissed.


Perhaps you like this person, but you aren't ready for a kiss. You will need to be clear about your expectations. If the person goes for a kiss, let him/her down gently and explain exactly why you don't want the kiss.
 A person is much more likely to try to kiss you if you are alone together and having an intimate moment. Invite mutual friends to hang out with you, or make sure that a friend is with you at all times. Spend time with the kisser in public places where he/she will be unlikely to try for a smooch., Talk about something unrelated to kissing â€“ something that will make it very hard for him/her to segue back to the subject of kisses. Suggest an activity that doesn't have much chance of leading to a kiss.


If you are refusing a kiss from a partner, hold his/her hand or rest your head on his/her shoulder. Show your partner that you can enjoy physical contact without kissing.
Constantly suck a lollipop when you're with them. It will be in your mouth, so they can't kiss you.
 If someone goes in for a kiss, divert them from your lips by tilting your head slightly to the side. Make it clear that you are offering up your cheek instead of your lips. The kisser should get the hint.
 Say that you have a cold or that you're recovering from a virus. Tell the person that you have a cold sore on your mouth, and that you don't want to kiss anyone in case you transmit the herpes simplex virus. Claim that you have a severe case of halitosis.


The problem with this approach is that it is just a delaying tactic. If you don't want to kiss this person at all, or not for a long time coming, then you'll need to say so.

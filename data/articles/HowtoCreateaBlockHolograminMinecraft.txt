 To enable cheats, click the Esc button, select Open to LAN, Â enable cheats, then test a command to see if it worked.;
, This command will give you a command block.
 Any repeater clock will do, but a 1-tick clock works best.
 Then insert the command /summon FallingSand {TileID:"minecraft:(Desired block ID)"} .
 Then, in the desired area, a block hologram should appear! Now it is your decision on what to do with it.

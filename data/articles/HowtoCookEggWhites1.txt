 Spray a medium nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Place the pan on the stove over medium heat.


You could also use an omelet pan, if you have one. The pan you do use should be the same diameter as the diameter you want for your finished omelet.;
, Combine the egg whites, salt, and pepper. Whisk the ingredients together until the egg whites become frothy.


You can adjust the amount of salt and pepper according to personal preference. Start with only a dash of each if you don't know how much you'd prefer.
 Pour the whisked egg whites into the preheated pan. Quickly turn the pan so that the egg whites spread over the entire bottom.
 Cook the egg whites without disturbing them for 1-1/2 to 2 minute, or until they seem evenly set all across the bottom.Note that the top of the egg whites should still appear glossy and slightly runny during this stage.
 Slide a rubber spatula beneath the set egg white. Carefully tilt the pan, allowing the raw egg to run off the top of the whites and beneath the set omelet.


If tilting the pan is too difficult, try tilting the egg whites to help drain off the remaining raw egg.
Allow the remaining raw egg white to cook for at least another 15 to 30 seconds.
 Sprinkle the chopped tomatoes and feta cheese crumbles over half of the omelet. Use the spatula to fold the other half over these toppings.


Tomatoes and feta cheese are only two examples of toppings you could use. If desired, you could replace them with up to 1/2 cup (125 ml) of other chopped vegetables and cheeses. You could also omit the toppings altogether and serve the omelet plain.
 Tilt the pan over a serving plate and use the spatula to carefully transfer the omelet from one to the other. Enjoy immediately.

 Once you have sewn together the body of the ornament, you can decorate the ornament and add any details you wish. You may want to add some sequins or ribbon. For example, if you are making a star-shaped ornament, you could glue on some sequins so that the star sparkles when it catches the light. Alternatively, if you made a gingerbread man ornament, you could glue ribbon and sequins to create eyes, and a mouth. You could also use different colours and sizes of ribbon and sequins to act as decorations on the cookie.


Be creative and have fun playing around with different designs and patterns.
 You can also cut out smaller pieces of felt and glue them on as additional decoration and detailing. For example, if you are making a bird, you could cut out a felt wing and glue it onto the front to add some depth to the ornament. Alternatively, if you made an angel ornament you could glue on felt wings to the back of the ornament.


Again be creative and play around with different types of felt add ons.
 You could also decorate a felt ornament with stitching. For instance, you could sew on lines to act as extra details. You could also use a cross stitch to add a picture or design to the front of the ornament. For example, if you made a ornament that looks like tree bauble, you could decorate it with stitched stripes and swirls.

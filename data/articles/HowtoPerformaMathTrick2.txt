 Let's say the victim thinks of the number 3. Of course, your victim shouldn't share the number with you.
 Now, your victim will add 1 to his number 3 to get 4. (1 + 3 = 4).
 Now, 4 x 10 = 40.
 90 + 40 = 130, so that should be the new number your victim has in his or her head.
 130/10 = 13. The way this trick works, the number your victim divides by 10 will always be divisible by 10, because he multiplied it by 10 earlier.
 Now, 13 - 10 = 3. No matter what, the victim should always end up with the number he or she started with! Pretty cool, huh?

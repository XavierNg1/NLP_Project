 When texting, the other person cannot see or hear your reaction, so things that sound nice when you say them may not read that way. Answering a casual, light-hearted question with "Yes, haha" or "Yeah" rather than just "Yes" will show your text-ee that you are in a good mood. The same goes for smilies. But don't go overboard; one smiley per text is plenty.;
, If a friend texts you something amusing, don't just respond with "lol." This leaves your friend with nothing to build the conversation on. Instead, try to follow up the "lol" with a question or an observation to keep the conversation flowing.
 In the event of a "text trap," which is where someone keeps texting you and won't stop, do not try to get out of it simply by saying "haha," "lol," or "yeah." The person may either not get the hint and continue texting you, or they may feel that you are a rude texter and not wish to associate with you. The best thing to do is to simply stop responding. They will understand. This also works when a friend says something you appreciate, but have no response for. Just let the conversation go.

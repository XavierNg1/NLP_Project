 Chrome is one of the most popular alternative browsers available for the iPad, and you may want to add bookmarks to it as well.


If you are logged into Chrome with your Google account, your bookmarks will be synced across all of your devices.
 This will open a small pop-up allowing you to set your bookmark options.
 Before the bookmark is added, you'll have a chance to edit it. By default, the bookmark will have the same name as the title of the webpage.
 If you need to make an adjustment to the address, you can do so before saving the bookmark. This can be useful if you actually wanted to bookmark the main page but are currently on a subpage.
 You can choose to add it to any of your existing folder, or you can create a new folder from within the pop-up.
 If you are logged into Chrome with your Google account, the bookmark will become available immediately on all of your connected devices.
 You can manage all of your Chrome bookmarks from within the Chrome app. Tap the Chrome Menu button (â˜°) and select "Bookmarks".


Tap "Edit" to quickly delete any of your bookmarks.
Press and hold a bookmark if you want to edit the name or address.

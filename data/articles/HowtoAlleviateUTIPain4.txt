 There are some symptoms that are common for UTIs. These include:


A strong desire or urge to urinate frequently
A burning sensation or burning pain during urination
Passing small amounts of urine frequently
Red, pink, or coca-cola colored urine, which indicate the presence of blood in the urine
Pelvic pain in the center of the abdomen around the pubic bone in women
Strong smelling urine, To reduce the possibilities of permanent damage, you need to know when to contact the physician. Unless your symptoms disappear within 24 hours with home treatments, it is very important to see your physician for antibiotic treatment. Reducing the pain of a UTI does not mean you have cured it. If you do not see a doctor, you can develop a kidney infection. Most UTIs do not go away on their own.


Your physician can prescribe antibiotics to kill the bacteria causing the infection. Take the entire bottle of antibiotics, even though the pain and burning lessens, because the bacterial growth has not been eliminated.
Follow up with your primary care provider if symptoms do not improve in three days. You may need gynecological exam if you are sexually active.
 Some women can experience recurrent infections. Three urinary tract infections or more are categorized as recurrent infections.


This can be caused by a lack of not emptying your bladder completely each time you urinate. Urine that remains in the bladder after urinating can significantly increase the risk of experiencing recurring UTIs.This may be from a structural abnormality in the lower urinary tract. You can schedule an ultrasound or CT scan to check for abnormalities.

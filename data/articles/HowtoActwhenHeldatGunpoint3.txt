 Call emergency services, discretely, but don't say anything if you can't without being noticed yet. Let them record that you called.
 Try to get away as most kidnappers don't want to kill you, at least not outright; they want to take you.
 Tell them your address, describe the kidnappers if possible, and tell them you need help now.
 Find a busy area, and run into a busy store or get a car to stop and quickly yell what's happening to you. Tell them "I need to get in two guys are chasing me!" or something like that. Chances are that they will let you in. If there are many witnesses around, the kidnappers will likely stop. But call emergency services anyway, because they might be waiting around the corner when you leave. The point is to get near people. Scream 'fire' - This is the best way to get noticed.

 Decrease the arguments and petulance of assigning chores by setting and enforcing a consistent time they occur. Tie them to a regular reward whenever possible. For example:


Instead of serving dessert at the end of dinner, serve it after the table is cleared and dishwasher loaded.
Afternoon snacks will hit the table after the trash is taken out.
Beds must be made before going outside to play.
The family pet must be fed before humans have breakfast.
 Establish routines around chores that reflect consistent instructions that are given one step at a time. Then have your child repeat the instruction then getting praise at each step.For example:


Loading the dishwasher: First load all the plates on the bottom. (“Great job!”). Now load all glasses on the top. (“Excellent!”). Next is silverware …
Laundry: First find all the pants and put them into a stack here. (“Awesome!”) Now put shirts in a stack there. (“Super-duper!”). Socks … then have the child fold each stack, then put the stacks in his or her room, one stack at a time.
 Use calendars, written schedules and chore boards to remind your child of chores that need to be done. These tools remove the “I forgot” excuse., Whenever possible, find ways to make chores more fun and help remove the stress of the task. You need to teach your child compliance, teamwork, and the need to pull his weight—but there’s no reason it can’t be fun at the same time.Belt out instructions in a variety of silly voices or have puppets give orders.
Walk backward when checking progress and make back-up “beeps.”
Have your child dress like Cinderella on a chore morning and play music from the movie that she can sing to as she works.Keep an eye on your child’s attitude. If you sense he or she is getting frazzled, make the next chore super silly or assign movement to it. Say to your child, “Pretend you are a shark as you put this book on my desk.” Or, simply call for a cookie break.

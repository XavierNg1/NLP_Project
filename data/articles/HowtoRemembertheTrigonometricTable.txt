In the first row, write down the trigonometric ratios (sin, cos, tan, cot).
In the first column, write down the angles (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°).
Leave other entries blank.;

We will fill in the blank entries in the sin column using the expression √x/2. Once the sine column is filled, we'll be able to fill all other columns effortlessly!


For the 1st entry in the sine column (that is, sin 0°), set x = 0 and plug it in the expression √x/2.
Thus, sin 0° = √0/2 = 0/2 = 0






For the 2nd entry in the sine column (that is, sin 30°), set x = 1 and plug it in the expression √x/2.
Thus, sin 30° = √1/2 = 1/2






For the 3rd entry in the sine column (that is, sin 45°), set x = 2 and plug it in the expression √x/2.
Thus, sin 45° = √2/2 = 1/√2






For the 4th entry in the sine column (that is, sin 60°), set x = 3 and plug it in the expression √x/2.
Thus, sin 60° = √3/2.






For the 5th entry in the sin column (that is, sin 90°), set x = 4 and plug it in the expression √x/2.
Thus, sin 90° = √4/2 = 2/2 = 1.

Simply copy the entries in the sine column in reverse order into the cosine column. This is valid because sin x° = cos (90-x)° for any x.

We know that tan = sin / cos. So, for every angle take its sin value and divide it by the cos value to get the corresponding tan value.
For example, tan 30° = sin 30° / cos 30° = (√1/2) / (√3/2) = 1/√3

,
Simply copy the entries in tangent column in reverse order into the cot column. This is valid because tan x° = sin x° / cos x° = cos (90-x)° / sin (90-x)° = cot (90-x)° for any x.

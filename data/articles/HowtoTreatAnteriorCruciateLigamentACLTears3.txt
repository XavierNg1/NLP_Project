 Your doctor may recommend that you get surgery on your ACL if you are an athlete and want to continue playing sports, particularly if the sport involves jumping or pivoting. You may also need surgery if there is more than one ligament that is damaged in your knee or there is cartilage in your knee and your knee is buckling with everyday use.Your doctor will refer you to an orthopedic surgeon. You can then set up a consultation with the surgeon to go over the ACL surgery in more detail.
 During the reconstruction of your ACL, the surgeon will remove the damaged ligament and replace it with a segment of tendon, which is tissue that is similar to a ligament. The replacement, called a graft, will come from another part of your knee or from a deceased donor. A new ligament will then grow on the graft in your knee and over time, your ACL will be complete again.This is generally done in an arthroscopic surgery, which uses tools to perform the surgery through small openings along the sides of your knee. You will be put under general anesthesia during the surgery.
Depending on your procedure, you may need to spend the night in the hospital after the surgery.
 You should discuss your recovery plan with your surgeon so your ACL heals properly. It will take about four to six months for you to recover completely and return to normal activity. You will need to go to physiotherapy and do strengthening exercises on your knee to ensure your ACL heals correctly.You may also need to stay off your feet for a period of time after the surgery to give your knee a chance to recover.
 To ensure your ACL tear heals properly, set up follow up appointments every few months after your surgery with your doctor. Your doctor can then confirm your knee is recovering properly and you are on track to gaining back mobility of your knee.


Having follow up appointments will also allow your doctor to check if there are any issues remaining in your knee joints or your ACL, even after the surgery.

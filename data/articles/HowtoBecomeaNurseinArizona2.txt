 It’s common for nursing programs to require students to complete certain classes before entering, or even applying to, a nursing education program. Be sure you’ve finished all the prerequisites before application and entrance deadlines.


Common prerequisites include human anatomy, physiology, biology, nutrition, and English.
 The first step toward completing your LPN or RN nursing program is to apply! Many applications are intensive and many also require an entrance exam. If it’s possible, apply to more than one program. This will increase your chances of being accepted to nursing school.


Each school’s application process is different, but most require a general application, transcripts, and a professional reference. Consult each individual school’s admissions office online or in person for details.
 Each nursing program has specific requirements that must be met in order to graduate. These will include classes, labs, and clinical practicums where you will gain professional nursing experience.


Make your education a priority and set aside regular blocks of time for studying. Nursing education programs are intense and time-consuming, requiring the utmost dedication.

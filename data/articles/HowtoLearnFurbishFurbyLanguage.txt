 This will help lots while you are learning.
 Start with simple ones. Learn words that will help you care for your Furby. For example, "a-tay" means hungry and "koo-doh" means health/healthy., To give an example, a Furby will often say "dah-ay-loh u-tye" when it wakes up. This means "big light up." This is how a Furby says good morning. The "dah-ay-loh" is the sun, "u-tye" means up., Start with words, move onto phrases, then start learning sentences. An example of a Furbish sentence is "Kah may-may u-nye wah!" This means "I love you!", The word "koh-koh" can be used as either "again" or "too." Listen to the way your Furby uses certain words to comprehend what they are saying., Furbish sentences will sometimes have extra words at the end in place of punctuation. "Wah" is used when the sentence is an exclamation. "Doo" is used when the sentence isÂ a question., You may feel silly at first, but this is a great way to remember the words. If you have a Furby from 2005-2006, you are lucky enough to have a Furby that will help you learn Furbish. It is called the "I speak Furbish" mode. To activate this mode, first say "Hey Furby!" Your Furby should answer. Then say "I speak Furbish!" Furby will then say "Oh-kay, wah!" You will know that Furby is ready to play. Say the command you want your Furby to do in Furbish. If you have said it right, then Furby will do that action!, It can be hard to remember all of the words, but you will catch on eventually.,

 You need to remove all of them, no matter what is said about string tension. Do it by any means but don't destroy your guitar.;
, Once all the strings are off, get a microfiber towel (preferably) or a non-lint rag, regular, plain ol' tap water, fine steel wool, sandpaper, a set of screwdrivers, pliers, and tape (only use painter's tape or automotive tape).
 It doesn't matter, but in this tutorial we will start with the neck.
 Use the screwdrivers and the pliers to snug up all screws and the nut and washers on the peg.
 Wipe the neck down, scrubbing inside the frets. You don't need to water a dead tree, get off all excess water, and do not ever use oils or other guitar "care" products.
 Tighten all screws and watch you don't mess with your set up. Do not use any guitar "care" products.
 They will become dirty and have a terrible sound to them.
 This part is time consuming, so you may skip it if you like. Tape off the frets, and use the steel wool to clean each and every fret. Remember that the steel wool will scratch your fretboard, so tape off right at the fret.

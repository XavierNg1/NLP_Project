 The watering can is available for purchase at Tom Nook’s store. In Wild World, the store is randomly placed, but it can be located by finding the leaf icon on the map at the bottom screen.


Enter the Nook’s store and take a look at the centermost table where all the tools are located. Because all of the objects for sale are displayed openly, all you need to do is look with your eyes for the watering can.
If you do see the watering can, approach it, and hit the “A” button while standing in front of it. Tom Nook will ask if you would like to purchase it. Simply select the purchase option.
If you do not seen the watering can, you will have to either wait a day, or manually adjust the date. Tom Nook’s inventory changes every day; hopefully you will only have to wait a few days for a watering can to appear
To manually change the date, start up the game to the point where your player is sleeping in their bed. Instead of selecting the player, select the phone over their head; this will give you the option to adjust the time and date.;
, Wilted flowers can be identified by its brown discoloration; search around your area to find one.
 Once you find a wilted flower, equip the watering can as you would any other tool: hit the “X” button to open up your inventory, and press “A” over the watering can to select it.
 To use the watering can, you must be facing flowers. Once you’re facing the flower, hit the “A” button. Your character will tilt the can over the flowers, which will sparkle to indicate that they have properly been watered.


Once a wilted flower has been watered, it will turn back to its normal color by the following day.

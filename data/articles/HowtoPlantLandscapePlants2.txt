Consider light conditions, and the soil and moisture requirements for the species when choosing their locations.
Make sure you have allowed enough room to accommodate the mature size of the plant.



Remove any sod or weeds, and loosen the soil in as wide and deep an area as possible.
If a soil amendment is going to be used, such as compost, work it into a wide area of soil; don’t just add it to holes when planting the perennials.



Perennials should be planted at the same depth they are growing in a pot. On bare root plants, make the hole 1”, (2.5 cm), deeper than the top of the roots.
Make the hole wider than the current root ball by a few inches. There should be plenty of room to spread the roots out.



If the roots filled the pot and then wrapped around many times at the bottom, take a knife or pruning shears and cut a thin slice off, straight across the bottom of the root ball.
With your fingers, gently spread out the root clump near the bottom of the root ball.
 Do not tamp down the soil.
 If the soil settles below the right level, add more soil and water them again.
 Don’t let the mulch touch plant stems or crowns.

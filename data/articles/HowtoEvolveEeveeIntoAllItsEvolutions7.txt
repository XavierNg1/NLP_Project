 Like Leafeon, you can evolve Glaceon right away after capturing an Eevee. However, doing so requires an Ice Rock, of which there are only a few in the game. Go to one of the areas listed below where ice rocks are located:


Sinnoh: Route 217
Unova: A room on the bottom floor of the basement of Twist Mountain
Kalos: Inside the Frost Cavern in Kalos. (You must have surf)
Hoenn: On the lowest floor in Shoal Cave, however only when the tide is low.
Alola: Inside the cave in Mount Lanakila

, Get into battles in the same area as an ice rock and gain experience for your Eevee. You don't have to be right next to the Ice Rock - you can level-it up anywhere within the areas listed above (note that the Twist Mountain Ice Rock requires you to be in the same room as it). When your Eevee gains a level, it should evolve into a Glaceon!


Glaceon's highest stats are Defense and Special Attack, and its ability, Snow Cloak, makes it more evasive in Hailstorms.

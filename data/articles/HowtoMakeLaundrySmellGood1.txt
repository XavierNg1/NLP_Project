Mist your dirty clothes with it before adding them to the washer., Laundry detergents come in a variety of scents, so go with whichever one appeals to you most.

Add it to your dryer’s load in the last ten minutes of the dry cycle to scent your clothes.You should be able to reuse the sheet a few times without having to do anything more than soak and wring it before each use. Give it a sniff after each use to judge the scent’s strength. If it’s weak or undetectable, include it in your next wash cycle and then add more drops afterward.

 This is very easy and really completes the salad.


Set the eggs in a pan and fill the pan with cold water. There should be an inch of water above the eggs.
Heat until a rolling boil, then turn the stove off and cover for 20 minutes. Do not remove the pan from the stove. During these 20 minutes you can begin preparing the lettuce.
Once 20 minutes is up, carefully drain the eggs and fill the pan with cold water, draining and refilling the pan until the eggs are fully cooled.;
, Try to shake most of the water from the lettuce.
 The lettuce should be cut in thin strips, and then cut a few times sideways to shorten any lengthy pieces.


Using a clean dishtowel, try to soak any excess water from the lettuce.
 The cucumber should be cut into quarters lengthwise and then sliced. For the tomatoes, just dice them as small as you'd like.
 Split the ramen noodles in half so each square piece is 1/2" thick, and soak each half in very hot water for about 30 seconds per side. Once all the noodles are softened, add them into the salad.
 Since the shrimp is already cooked, you can just fry until the shrimp until the shrimp is how you like it. Ideally, you should fry the shrimp for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently.


Put 4 Tbsp. in the pan and turn the stove on to medium-high heat.
When the butter is very hot, add the shrimp to the pan and begin frying them.
After you add in the shrimp, add the cilantro, garlic salt, and juice from one half of the lime to the pan.
Fry the shrimp until the shrimp is beginning to turn a nice golden-brown shade, and is starting to get just a tiny but crispy on the outside.
 If you have a favorite vinaigrette dressing you can use that, or eat the salad as it is!


Alternatively, have your guests serve the shrimp directly onto their plates after being served salad.
Got any leftover lime? Feel free to juice that and let your guests add a bit more spice to their salad using the lime juice!

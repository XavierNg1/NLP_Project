 If you don’t spend time building your muscles at the gym, you can injure yourself running or hit a “performance plateau.” This means that you don’t see any improvement for a long period of time despite training harder and harder., Choose some relatively light dumbbells. Spread your feet about shoulder-width apart and point your toes forward. Hold the dumbbells in your arms down against your side. Lower yourself down into a squatting position, keeping your knees under your toes and extending your rear backwards. Do several repetitions of this exercise., Lie down on the floor or on a yoga mat. Put your hands directly underneath your shoulders a shoulder-width apart. Straighten your back and neck, creating a straight line with your body. Hold this position for a minute before resting. Make sure you keep your back straight – don’t let your hips droop towards the mat or you could injure your back.
 Lie on the floor or on a yoga mat. Place your hands on the floor right next to your armpits, palms down. Push yourself up from the floor using only your arms into a plank position. Once your arms are extended, lower yourself again until your chest is just above the mat. Return to the plank position by extending your arms.Make sure your back stays straight so that you don’t injure yourself.
If regular pushups are too difficult, consider changing your technique. Instead of resting your feet on the ground, rest your knees on the ground and tuck your feet behind you.

 You can also try another type of bread roll instead.
 Set the bottom half of the roll down, cut-side-up. Place 2 slices of ham on top of it, followed by 2 slices of Swiss cheese.


If you don't like Swiss cheese, you can try another type of cheese, such as Monterey Jack.
 Scoop the mayo into a small cup or bowl. Add the honey, dried mustard, and poppy seeds. Stir everything together with a fork or mini whisk until evenly combined.
 Flip the top half of the bread roll over so that the under/cut side is facing you. Use a butter knife to spread the honey-mustard across the roll.
 Place the top half of the roll down onto the cheese, with the honey-mustard side facing down. For a fancier sandwich, stir a pinch of poppy seeds into ¼ tablespoon of melted butter, then spread it across the top of your sandwich with a pastry brush.
 To turn this into a tasty, gourmet sandwich, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Once the oven reaches the correct temperature, place the sandwich onto a baking sheet and tuck it inside. Bake the sandwich for 15 to 20 minutes.
 If you baked the sandwich, let it cool for about 3 to 5 minutes before digging in. If you want a fancier presentation, cut the sandwich in half. Stick a fancy, sandwich/cocktail toothpick through the middle of each half.

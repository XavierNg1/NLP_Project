 If you see a suicide threat but are not close enough to the person to contact them yourself, reach out to the person’s family or friends. They may not be aware of the post. Let them know what you saw on Facebook and that you are worried about the poster.The person’s family and friends may be able to reach the person better than you can. They may be aware of a suicide plan already in place that you don’t know about.
For example, you may say, "I saw a post on Jane's Facebook page where she threatened to commit suicide. I am concerned about her and wasn't sure if you knew about this post."

, You may want to reach out to the person and offer support. Start off by offering to listen to the person. Don’t be afraid to ask, “Are you thinking about suicide?” and “What has led you to feel this way?” Listen as the person shares their feelings with you.Comfort the person. Be kind, gentle, and supportive as you let the person know that you are there for them.
Let the person know that you are concerned about them. Say, “I am concerned about your safety and your life. You are important.”
Tell the person you care about them and they mean something to you. For example, say, “You are important to me. I care about you.” You may even want to pay them a visit if you live close to the person and know them well.
 If a person is threatening to commit suicide, they need help. If you believe they need immediate help because they are going to commit suicide very soon, call 911 or other emergency services. Do not feel bad or embarrassed about calling for help.

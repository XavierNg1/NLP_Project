 Schedule a consultation appointment. This is a 30-minute meeting between you and your stylist. You will talk over style options without actually getting your hair cut. This will relieve some of the pressure on you while also giving you a chance to discuss your fears.Choose your stylist carefully as they will have a great deal of control over the final product. Look for online reviews and ask for client references, if possible.
Be honest about your lifestyle, in particular, as some short styles are low maintenance while others require a considerable amount of time. If your stylist asks, “How much time would you like to spend on your hair in the morning?” There is no shame in answering, “Five minutes or less.”;
, If your friend has a particularly flattering short haircut that you think would work for you as well, ask to take their head shot. Flip through magazines and clip out images of hair styles that you like and would consider as options. Then, bring all of these images to the salon with you.


Remember that there are limits as to what a good haircut can achieve. Do not cut out a photo of a celebrity and then expect a salon visit to transform you into that celebrity. Instead, be specific about what you like about a cut. Think, “The layers around her face really flatter her cheekbones.”, Tie your hair back into a loose pony, adjusting it so that your hair is at your future length. Take a photo of your head from a variety of angles. Ask yourself, “Am I going to look good with this hair?” Continue to make adjustments and take new photos until you are happy with the model hairstyle.
 Upload a head shot to certain websites, or using particular computer programs, and you can digitally alter your hair in the image. This will allow you to see how a particular cut will look on you in ‘real time.’

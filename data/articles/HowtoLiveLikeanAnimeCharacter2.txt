 Anime is nothing if not flashy, so don’t be afraid to be more bold in the way you dress. Female anime characters often wear skirts and blouses that are unbuttoned at the throat. Guys often wear multiple layers, including a hoodie, or elaborate formal attire.


If you see an interesting outfit that you would normally be afraid to wear, buy it anyway and wear it knowing that you look good.
Take the look of one of your favorite characters and adapt it to fit what you like most. Overall, be confident about the outfits you choose.
Anime characters are not afraid to stand out for their crazy outfits. If it seems a little too outrageous, give it a try anyway.
 The worlds of most anime characters are filled with dazzling colors, so you can use them in your life, too. If you tend to stick with black, white, and grey, make a bold change in your wardrobe. You can even add some bright colors to your hair, like many anime characters have.


Use bright colors in other ways like painting your room in vivid colors, decorating with posters and objects that with bright colors, and buying sparkly school supplies.
 Adding makeup and a new hairstyle to your look can significantly change your appearance. Look at your favorite characters and try to achieve their look. Take a picture of your favorite character's hair to the salon and ask the stylist to cut it that way. Add elaborate eye makeup and bright lipstick, if appropriate, for a new look.


If you don’t typically wear makeup, this can be an exciting new step to take. Ask someone you know who is good at makeup to help you, or watch videos online that will teach you some easy techniques.
If you can’t cut your hair, try other ways of styling it. Braid your hair into long pigtails, spike it with gel, or put it into multiple ponytails.

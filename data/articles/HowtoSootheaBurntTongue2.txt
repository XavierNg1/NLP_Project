 Look for cough drops that contain benzocaine, menthol or phenol. All of these ingredients act as local anesthetic, numbing your tongue and helping to relieve pain. Anesthetic mouthwash which contains these ingredients may help as well.
 Chewing a gum that contains menthol can help to activate the cold-sensitive receptors on your tongue, making your tongue feel nice and cool. Both peppermint and spearmint flavor gums contain menthol derivatives., If the pain in your tongue is very bad, consider taking over-the-counter pain medication, such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen. This will ease the pain and help to bring down any swelling.
 Most burn creams and ointments are designed for topical use only.


They should not be applied to the tongue, as they may contain ingredients that are toxic if ingested.
The only exception to this are burn creams and ointments that are designed specifically for oral use.
 If your burnt tongue remains painful or swollen for more than 7 days, it is recommended that you see a doctor. The doctor may prescribe stronger forms of pain relief or medication to speed healing.


If the burning sensation in your tongue arises on its own, without having physically burned it on hot food or drink, you may have a condition known as burnt tongue syndrome. This can be very painful and may affect other areas of the mouth.
If you suspect that you may have burnt tongue syndrome, it is recommended that you see your doctor immediately as it may be a symptom of a more serious underlying issue such as diabetes, hyperthyroidism, depression or food allergy.

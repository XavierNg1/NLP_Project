 The front belts would have to be mounted on the "B" pillar, or on the upper door frame if it was a hardtop. You would have to do some beefing up in the mounting area, especially in the case of the hardtop.;
, You might be able use the bits from that car in the one you want to install the belts.
 The floor mountings should be no problems, as Chrysler had the floors drilled for belts, front and rear, from at least 1962. For example, the 1965 Valiant has plates with a threaded bolt welded in place where the belts go (it only has front belts, but these plates are in the rear as well). The 1962 Valiant and Lancer have the holes front and rear with belts only on the front. There are no mounting plates, but the belts have a nut and bolt arrangement with a large round "washer" inside and out. The one under the floor is about 3" in diameter. The "washer" takes the strain in the case of an accident and spreads it over a larger area.
 The corners of square or rectangular ones could cut through the floor, or whatever panel the belts are mounted, in an accident. Welding these plates/washers in place would also strengthen the support.
 Or, you could drill a hole through the floor in the area over the axle. This spot is higher than the floor where the seat is, and thus you would not need such a long belt. Also, the steel is thicker - just use a plate to add extra strength to the mounting point.
 You could try the wheelhouse, on a flat area. Again that would mean a shorter belt, but would need those plates to add more strength to the mounting point.
 They are a safety feature, and given the traffic these days, perhaps a safety necessity.

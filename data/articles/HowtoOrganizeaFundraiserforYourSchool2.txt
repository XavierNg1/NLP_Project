 If everything is not set up, the fundraiser looks unprofessional and doesn't draw people in. Have music/slideshow/anything else that draws attention before the first person comes in. Rule of thumb: If the event starts at 5:30, come before 5:00. Come at least 1/2 an hour early, and possibly more.
 If people are paying, have someone check in people at the door. This will help you keep organized. as well as having a number of people to use if you're playing any sort of game.
 This will ensure the most people take part in your event.
 No one will just hand money over to a school because you say "We need it!!!" Delve into deeper detail like that.
 You want people to want to donate/take part; this is most important.
 If you have not already, ask for donations. This will ensure that you get the most funds for your event.
 After everyone has left, clean up the place where you hosted the event. If your school requires kids to do community service, offer community service for helping.
 Use the funds for your cause. Congratulations, you're done!

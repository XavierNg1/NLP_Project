 For a casual look, allow your hair to fall naturally over your shoulders. Comb through it with your fingers to smooth it if necessary, and then gather it together at the nape of your neck.If your hair is extremely thick and unruly, you may want to use a hair elastic to secure it at the nape of your neck so it’s easier to braid.
 When you’ve gathered your hair at the nape of the neck, divide it into three sections that are roughly the same size. Braid your hair by taking one of the outer sections and crossing it over the middle section. Cross the other outer section over the middle, and repeat the process until all of your hair is braided.If your hair is extremely thick, you can also create a braid with just two sections. Cross the sections over one another until you reach the ends of your hair.
 Once you’ve braided your hair, use a hair elastic or clip to secure the end of it. Pull some pieces of hair out of the braid to give it a more relaxed, casual look. It’s especially pretty to pull some curls loose around your face.If you prefer, you can gather your hair over to one side and create a side braid instead of a traditional style at the nape of the neck.

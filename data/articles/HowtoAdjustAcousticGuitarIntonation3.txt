 If the saddle's base is uneven, the strings may be supported at different heights, changing the intonation. You may push shims underneath the saddle to correct this, but this can make the saddle more fragile.It's much more effective to compensate the saddle, but this repairs requires wood tools and the skill of a professional luthier.

To measure this, you'll need a cheap tool called a radius gauge. Place the radius onto the 12th fret, cycling through the gauges until you find a good fit. Now place that gauge on the saddle, after tuning your guitar. The tool should touch and mute both E strings, and get close enough to the middle four strings to cause a sitar-like buzz.

You can also measure string height with a ruler with 132{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{32}}} inch marks. The bottom of the low E string should be 332{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{32}}} inches away from the 12th fret, and the high e string should be 232{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{32}}} away.
 If you want to try this yourself, you can buy a pre-compensated saddle that you think will adjust the problem strings in the correct direction. The results are usually not perfect, but the cost is lower than a professional repair, usually falling between $5 and $100 US depending on material.

You can also buy "blanks" and experiment in filing your own compensations into the saddle. Be sure to leave a sharp edge on the lower side of the saddle to stop all string vibration there.
 In some cases, a weak soundboard provides an unstable surface for the bridge, knocking it out of alignment. This is a diagnosis and repair best done by a professional.
 Some guitarists who want their intonation as perfect as possible claim that certain unusual fret boards improve the setup. Fanned-fret guitars are one example.

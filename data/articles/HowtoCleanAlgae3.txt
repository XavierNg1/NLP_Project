 Rooftops are particularly prone to algae buildup. Stop by a local hardware store and get zinc or copper strips. You can install these strips along each side of your roof. This should help prevent algae.Install the strips along the side of the roof just below your roof's ridge.
 If you have a pond that's prone to algae, adding more plant life can help keep algae away. You can purchase plants that fight algae at your local greenhouse and plant them in or around your pond.Floating plants, like lilies and lotus, provide shade that blocks sunlight. This can slow down algae growth.
Plants that you submerge in water can also help fight algae. Go for plants like anacharis, hornwort and parrotâ€™s feather. You can safely plant one bunch of six to seven submerged plants per two square feet of your pond.
 If you do not already have an aquarium filter in your fish tank, buy one at a local pet store. Installing an aquarium filter will help keep algae and other dangerous and unwanted substances out of your tank., If algae is a major problem in your fish tank, add some fish that eat algae. Catfish tend to eat algae and you can also install coral at the bottom of your tank.Be careful when adding new fish to an existing tank. Ask at the pet store if a particular type of fish is safe for your tank given its existing inhabitants.

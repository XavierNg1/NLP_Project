 A conversation starter doesn't have to be complex. You can bring up the weather or what's going on in your city. You can mention a new movie or a new book on the market. Anything can open up the way for a conversation.For instance, you could say "Did you see that bit about the mayor slipping on the city steps? What a way to start off a term!"

, If you see he's carrying a wallet featuring a certain sports team, ask him about it. If you notice his scotch is an expensive brand, inquire about how he got into drinking scotch. Asking people about what they like is a sure way to start a conversation.As an example, if you see he likes the Texas Rangers, you could say, "How do you think the Rangers are shaping up this year? I'm ready for the season to start!"

, Make a pun or even tell a joke you've memorized by heart. Guys like humor, and it will draw him into the conversation.It's fine if your joke is a little cheesy. For instance, you could open with "Jeez, somebody forgot to turn off the snow, didn't they? They should fire that guy."

, People love to talk about themselves, so ask about his job or his hobbies. It's a great way to start building a relationship, especially if you have mutual interests.For instance, you could say, "So what do you do for a living?" or "What do you like to do in your spare time?" You could also ask "What are you passionate about?"

, Actually listen to what he has to say and respond to what he's saying. You don't want to overpower him with too much talking.However, he also wants to get to know you, so don't always deflect the conversation back to him. Be willing to share some about yourself.For instance, if he says he enjoys gardening, you could say, "I've always had a black thumb, but I love fresh herbs. It must be nice to be able to grow things well."

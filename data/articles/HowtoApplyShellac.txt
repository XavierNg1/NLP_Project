 Use a coarse-grit sandpaper to go over the entire piece. If there is an old finish applied to the wood, make sure to sand it away completely. After sanding, wipe the piece down with a clean cloth to remove any dust and dirt.;
, Avoid dipping your brush directly into the shellac can, as this can contaminate the product with wood dust and other particles. Instead, load your brush from a separate bucket.
 Shellac can either be applied with a natural-bristled brush (china bristle is ideal) or a synthetic-bristled brush. Note that it can be difficult to clean the shellac from a natural-bristled brush without damaging the bristles. Do not use a foam brush to apply shellac, as the shellac tends to dry into the brush too quickly and hardens it.
 Dip the brush into the bucket of shellac and press it gently against the side of the bucket to remove the excess.
 Shellac should be applied in long, smooth strokes, following the grain of the wood to ensure an even application. Shellac dries very quickly, so it is important to work quickly and efficiently.


If you miss a spot when applying the shellac, avoid going back to touch it up. Because shellac dries very quickly, the partially dried shellac that is already applied will not blend smoothly into the fresh application. The missed spot will become less noticeable as more coats are applied.
 Let the first coat dry completely, which can take as little as 30 minutes in a well-ventilated area. Once it is dry, sand the entire finish lightly with a fine-grit sandpaper to prepare it for the next coat of shellac.
 Apply the next coat just as you did the first, being careful to work along the grain. When the second coat is dry, you can sand the finish again and apply another coat, or simply leave the wood with 2 coats.
 Shellac can be cleaned from brushes with a mixture of ammonia and water. Mix equal parts ammonia and water, and then soak the brush bristles in the mixture. Rinse the brush and allow it to dry before storing.

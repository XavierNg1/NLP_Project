 For citations in APA style, you'll embed a reference to your citation in the text, then include a reference list at the end of your essay.
 Directly after the sentence in which you reference the information from the website, add a in-text citation.


Use an open parenthesis after the last word.APA style uses the author and date. If you know the author of the text and the date it was published, put the last name of the author, a comma, and the date (year) of publication inside the parentheses.If you don't know the author, put the title of the work in quotations, a comma, and the date (year) of the publication inside the parentheses.Close the parentheses. Place the close parenthesis directly after the date.Put a period at the end of the sentence right after the close parenthesis.
You can also include the citation near the beginning of the sentence. If you use the author's last name at the beginning, you can include just the date after it in parenthesis, such as in the following instance: "Smith (2005) notes that cherry pies are delicious.", Format the citation in hanging indention, where the first line is not indented but every line after it is indented. Use the following format for whole websites.


Author's Last Name, Author's First Initials. (Publication Date). Document Title. Retrieved from URLThe citation looks like this one: Smith, J. (2005). Cherry Pie for Beginners. Retrieved from http://www.piesforeveryone.com

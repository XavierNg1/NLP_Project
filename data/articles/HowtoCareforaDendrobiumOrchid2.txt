Use dead wood chips, much sunlight and good air circulation as optimal growth conditions for your plant.






Remember that the tree does not retain water, and has plenty of air around it.
Provide lots of drainage and holes (if in a pot) for air flow.


Use any spray bottle for misting.






Avoid using chlorinated or “softened” water. These do not exist in the natural habitat and are both harsh on the plant.



If your house in winter uses heat, use either an orchid cage or terrarium to increase humidity.


Do this several times per year as the sun changes position throughout the year.






Remember, the dendrobium needs natural sunlight.


Use a basket and hang towards the outer part of a tree or overhang on a porch.


After being indoors, they, like people, can burn if moved too quickly into a great deal of natural light.



In their natural habitat roots are used to collect dead insects, dust, rotting tree matter as a food source.


Use orchid fertilizer in a mister once every three months.






Too much fertilizer will burn the roots, so fertilize only as directed.






Do not attempt to push your orchid with too much fertilizing.


Two to three times per week of rain or mist is normal and the average.


Do not change how your orchid is planted more than absolutely required.




Too much “fussing” about the orchid is how most people kill them.






Give the orchid simulated optimal conditions and except for misting, leave it alone.

 This should be a donut-shaped object directly on the back of the speaker cone.
 You will need to have this information when selecting the right shield.
 This can be any magnetic metal large enough to cover the back of the magnet.


Consider the most readily available materials first. Common steel items like pipe-caps for air ducts or electrical steel junction boxes will do the job nicely. Best of all, you can find them at any hardware store.
Special products may be purchased which are designed especially to shield speaker magnets. They are just thick enough to shield the magnet, but are also thin enough to be cut with scissors for just the right shape.
 Use a strong adhesive tape to bind your shield to the speaker.

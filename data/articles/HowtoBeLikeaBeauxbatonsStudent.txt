 For example, you will notice the Beauxbatons girls wear fluttery blue robes and hats. They walk gracefully and are always polite. The Beauxbatons students act like they are better than everybody else-and they are! They are completely confident with everything they say and do. Incorporate these traits into your everyday life, and you will slowly become more Beauxbatons.;
, Every student in that school speaks French and most students also know English.If you can't, just throw in little french phrases into your speech, like "Bonjour", "Merci" and "Salut!" If you don't learn french in school, you could try learning french out of a book or online. You could also google Fleur Delacour quotes and copy her graceful, intelligent way of talking.
 If you can't, wear light blue as often as you can, and you could try a trilby.
, Keep it tidy.
 Try not to be boring though! Never get angry or frustrated, but if you do, don't show it! The Beauxbatons girls are always calm and quiet. Don't bore people with constant spouts of knowledge, and don't seem overly confident.
 As threatening as they might look, the Beauxbatons girls are actually very friendly and caring. Look after a friend in need or take the new girl under your wing. Get good grades and try your best at everything.
 Wear just enough make up to look stunning, but not too much. The Beauxbatons girls are natural and never wear too much make up. Try some light foundation-mineral powder works best, wear lots of mascara (try only the top lashes), a hint of blush, and clear or sparkly lip gloss. Always look your best, no matter where you are going. Remain polished and beautiful at all times

, Wear a feminine, light scent. For example, Bath and Body Works has a line called Paris Amour (translated into Love Paris) that is supposed to smell like France.

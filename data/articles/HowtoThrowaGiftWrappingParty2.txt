 This not only has a decorative appeal while setting the tone for your party, it has the added bonus of protecting the surface of whatever you wrap. This kind of decoration is perfect for the table where you’ll be doing your wrapping.Adhesive from tape, errant marks from pens or markers, and so on can cause damage to your wrapping table. Protecting the table with a decorative layer of wrapping paper will help prevent this.
 You don’t have to choose a wrapping party themed playlist, though your guests might be impressed if you do. However, your favorite band or a seasonally appropriate playlist (like Christmas music during the holidays or a spooky one at Halloween) will also provide a suitable ambiance to get your guests in the wrapping mood. Some song ideas include:


"Ain't Too Proud to Beg," The Temptations
"All I Want Is You," Barry Louis Polisar
”Her Morning Elegance,” by Oren Lavie
"I Like It, I Love It," Tim McGraw
"Is This It?" The Strokes
"My List," The Killers
"Objects of My Affection," Peter Bjorn and John
"Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want," The Smiths
"Pretty Things," Rufus Wainwright
"Take It Back," She & Him
"This Gift," Sons & Daughters, A little bit of background scenery can also add a lot to the atmosphere of your wrapping party. You may want to mute the sound on your TV or turn the volume down low so you can chat with your friends while you wrap. Some ideas for this include:


Seasonally suitable movies, like ‘’It’s a Wonderful Life’’ at Christmas time, ‘’Father of the Bride’’ for bridal showers and wedding events, or ‘’Hocus Pocus’’ during Halloween.
Movies that you know you and your partygoers will enjoy. For example, if you know most of your friends enjoy Harry Potter, you might put on your favorite movie in this franchise.

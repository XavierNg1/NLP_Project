 Choose a pan that will just fit your meat or vegetables so that you can use a small amount of liquid.
 You can also do this to green beans, broccoli, or other delicate vegetables. Meat and vegetables should be cooked separately.
 When they feel tender, remove them from the pan.


You can also poach meat or vegetables on the grill by creating packets out of aluminum foil. Place a small amount of liquid in the foil and then add your meat or vegetables. Place them over the medium-heat of a grill until they are tender.

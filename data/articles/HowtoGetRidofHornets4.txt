 Home repair and improvement warehouse stores will have a wide selection of wasp and hornet sprays for a variety of prices. (Buy the least expensive product; they all work similarly.) Two or more aerosol cans are recommended for anything larger than a small nest.


Don't buy generic insecticide unless the label confirms that it works on hornets. You must be certain that the spray has the capacity to handle hornets.
 The wasps or hornets will be mostly by the nest getting ready to sleep or wake up and won't be flying around. Night is also good since they will be sleeping, and therefore more docile, but you will have more trouble seeing and escaping if the nest does get aggressive.
 Wear long sleeves, tucked into gloves, long pants tucked into your socks, and a wide brimmed hat with a nylon stocking over it, tucked into the neckline of your shirt.
 Insecticide kills insects, but it isn't exactly good for people, either. At the very least, provide good ventilation with a fan or retreat quickly after the initial assault.
 Most have a 15 foot (4.6Â m) or more range, so you can start from far away, but after a few seconds you will want to get in close and really soak the nest. The chemicals kill nearly instantly, so there is not much risk. After applying the chemical, leave the area and allow fumes to clear.


The returning wasps will also die, so leave the nest alone for a few days.

 Fill a small cup of warm water. Add three cups of a gentle dish soap or all-purpose cleaner. Don’t use one that has bleach or vinegar, since the acid can damage the belt. Most stains can be handled by detergent or fabric cleaner no matter the origin. You don’t have many options for cleaners because they are too harsh for the seat belt.
 Dip the bristles of the brush into the bowl to pick up some of the cleaner. Minimize the amount of moisture on the brush as much as possible to avoid soaking the seat belt.
 Move downwards from the top of the stain. Be careful not to move the brush in a circle or go back up the belt. Scrub the stain gently, adding small amounts of cleaner when necessary to apply a light, even coating.
 For truly stubborn stains, you or a professional can use a steam machine or hot water extractor. Once you’ve added a coating of fabric cleaner or upholstery shampoo, run the machine over the belt on a low moisture setting.

 Flat weave rugs have no pile and are made from durable materials. Due to their thin but sturdy nature, they will appear dirty more often than other rugs because there is less room for dust and dirt to hide. Although excessive vacuuming can sometimes cause the rug to shed, the durable materials can endure quite a lot before this occurs., If vacuumed up, the fringe can wrap around the beater bar and cause damage to both the vacuum and the rug.For this reason, either temporarily turn off the beater bar when vacuuming the edges, or use a canister vacuum that relies only on suction. If you only have access to a beater bar vacuum, manually hold down the fringe as you vacuum past it.
 Flat weave rugs are reversible and both sides are susceptible to becoming dirty. By vacuuming both sides you are removing grit that may wear your rug out early.Flip these rugs occasionally to distribute wear evenly to both sides. This will increase their lifespan and decrease shedding.

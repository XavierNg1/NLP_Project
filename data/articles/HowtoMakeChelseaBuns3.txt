 This can lead to a much more nuanced bun, and prevents overly strong bites of spice by more evenly distributing it throughout the entire bun. Remember when spicing to smell your spice mixture before adding -- if it smells good, it will likely taste good, too. To spice the dough, simply whip up your dough like normal, adding the following to the dough after the milk and egg:

Zest of 1 lemon
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice or mixed spice (combine cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves, allspice, and/or cardamom).
 Remember that you do need some sugar -- at least 1 teaspoon, to help feed the yeast. That said, how much sugar you add is largely up to you. Want more "spiced," less sugary buns? Stick to just a teaspoon. But equally correct are sweeter dessert buns, which can take 2-3 tablespoons of sugar. There are many recipes on the internet, but the basics are easily adjusted to change the exact flavor you want., Butter leads to denser, but richer, doughs. There are recipes that call for as much as 8 melted tablespoons of butter in the total recipe, 5 in the dough and three for the filling. If you want something just a bit more decadent, try throwing in 1-2 extra tablespoons of butter when warming the milk., While currants are the most common fruit for a Chelsea bun, they aren't your only option. Other popular fruits include:

Raisins
Craisins
Sultanas
Dried apricots (cut small)
Dried cherries

, This may cause them to lose some of their spiral shapes, but it ensures that the fruit doesn't burn, as well. Simply add the dried fruit in after the dough is almost done mixing and bake like normal.

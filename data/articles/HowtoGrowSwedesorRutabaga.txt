 The best soil type for swedes is a well-drained, light soil that has been manured well. Provided there is good drainage, swedes will also grow well in heavy clay soils that receive regular moisture.;
, This is very important as it allows the bulbous roots plenty of time to grow before the coldest of winter strikes.
 Place the large, bullet-shaped seeds in drills to a depth of 2 centimeter (0.8 in) in light soils. Make it only 1.25 centimeter (0.5 in) for a heavier soil.
 The seeds should germinate within 7 - 12 days. Thin the seedlings to 22 centimeter (8.7 in) intervals about three weeks following sowing. This will be when the seedlings have developed their first set of rough leaves.
 Swedes will grow through autumn (fall) and winter. They can be pulled when required and left in the ground to keep growing in the meantime.

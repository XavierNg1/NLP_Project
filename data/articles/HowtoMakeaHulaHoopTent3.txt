 Choose the fabric of your choice to accent your tent’s color(s), patterns, and/or textures. Cut it into triangles or any other shape that pleases you. Attach adhesive velcro strips to the backs of these. Attach corresponding strips along your tent, over the hula hoop. Then simply press the two strips together to attach your bunting., Give yourself the ability to close your tent’s flap. Attach adhesive velcro strips along the edge of one flap, facing inside. Then, for each strip used, attach a corresponding one on the inside of your other’s flaps edge. Pinch the strips together to keep the flaps from whipping open when you’d rather seal yourself off from the world., Use adhesive strips or tape to line the hoop with strands or strips of decorative lights on the inside and/or outside of your tent (like Christmas, star, or fairy lights).However, be sure to use LED lights. Avoid using other bulbs, like incandescent ones, since these emit far more heat and pose a fire risk.

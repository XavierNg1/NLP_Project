 Paying a larger down payment can help you qualify for a loan you would otherwise not get. Making a down payment of 20 percent or more will show lenders that you have enough money to afford the loan, despite your poor credit., If you have bad credit, lenders will see lending to you as a risk. This means that they will charge you higher interest rates than a borrower with good credit would get in order to counteract that risk. You may be able to qualify for a loan by accepting these high rates, but keep in mind that the interest be very expensive over the life of the loan and will increase your monthly payments., Your DTI, defined as the percentage of your monthly income that goes towards paying off debt, should be lower than 45 percent. For a borrower with low credit, an even lower DTI can help you get a loan. Improve your DTI and your standing with a lender by showing a recent increase in income or a decrease in your debt payments.


For example, if you recently paid off a car or your home, you will have a sudden reduction in debt that will give you more buying power and a better chance of getting a loan., While it may not be what you want to hear, the best thing to do is to make an effort to improve your credit before taking on more debt to buy an RV. You can improve your credit by paying overdue bills, removing errors from your record, and lowering your outstanding debt balances. You can also improve your credit over time by making payments on time and using less of your available credit.


Even if you don't improve your credit score dramatically, showing that you made an effort to do so can convince a lender to finance your RV purchase.

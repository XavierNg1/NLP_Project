 The person who is judging the cards will rotate with every turn, so pay attention to what each player tends to choose as the winning card. Do they tend to choose things that are silly and outlandish, funny and descriptive, or serious? Choose a card that you think the judge would most likely pick.This strategy works best if you know the judge's personality, likes and dislikes.;
, Remember that the judge does not know whose card is whose, so you can use this to your advantage. After the judge reads the cards out loud, you can say things to encourage them to choose a particular card - either your own or a favorite.Try saying something like, “Wow! ___ ___ is a great combo. You should pick that one.”
Keep in mind that some judges will not be swayed by other players comments, but it doesn’t hurt to try!

, If you are playing by the rule that the last card thrown will not be judged, then playing your cards right away is a good idea. If you take too long to choose, then you may not get a chance to win a point for that hand.Try to decide which card you are going to play as fast as you can and then throw it down right away.
 While the goal of the game is to play red cards with meanings that match the green card, make sure that you play a silly card now and then. Judges will often choose the silliest card as the winner even if some of the other cards do a better job of matching the meaning of the card.The rules of Apples to Apples Junior are very loose in this way because the game is more about having fun than being competitive.

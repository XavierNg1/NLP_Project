 A passionate hug shouldn’t come out of nowhere. Flirt with him first. Make it clear you are interested in him.
 You can do this by taking his hand, putting an arm around his waist, or tugging the front of his shirt. Pull his hips in to your hips, run your hand over his back, and give him a sexy smile.
 Wrap your arms around him and pull him even closer. Notice the physical sensation of being so close. Smell him. Feel his arms around you. Enjoy yourself.
 Run a hand through his hair, or across his back. Make a soft, “mmm” sound. If you're enjoying the hug, he should be able to sense it.A quick back rub is not sensual. Move your hands slowly, exploring his body.
 Maybe a hug is all the passion you’re up to right now, maybe not. Often a passionate hug is leading to more, but it doesn’t have to.


If you want to turn the hug into a kiss, lean your torso back so your hips are still pressed together, look him in the eyes, and go for it.If you want to end the hug, squeeze him gently, and lean back. Grab his hand as you break apart, and give it a light squeeze before letting go. Look into his eyes, and give him a mischievous smile as you break away.

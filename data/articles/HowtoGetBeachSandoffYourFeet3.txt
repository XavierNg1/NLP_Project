 When packing your beach essentials for the day, include a wash basin that can fit feet inside of it comfortably. Also take a generous amount of water with you, at least a gallon sized container.If you are traveling to the beach with more people, bring one gallon of water for each person to use for cleansing purposes.
 The basin should not only be on a flat surface, but also on a surface that is not sandy. The goal is to not have to repeat its use once you’ve washed yourself off.
 Make sure there is enough water in the basin that feet are completely submerged underneath the water. Use your hands to douse sandy areas of the skin with water.


In the place of your hands, a clean sponge can be used to help with sand removal.
Be gentle with your skin as you get the sand off. It’s easy to get abrasions if you rub too hard.
 If there is still sand left on your feet, you might need to empty the water and start over by refilling the basin with clean water. Wipe off any excess water with a clean towel.


Rinse out the basin in between cleanings.

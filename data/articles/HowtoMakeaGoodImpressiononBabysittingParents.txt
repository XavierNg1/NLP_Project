 Wear an appropriate outfit, not something you might wear to a friend's house. Comb your hair, brush your teeth, and put on a nice body spray, or deodorant. This will give the parents the impression that you take care of yourself. (Which is hopefully true!) Be sure to avoid shorts shorter than a few inches above the knee, very tight clothing, anything badly ripped, and miss matched clothes.;
,, Say something like, "You have a lovely home." Or compliment the mother's clothing.
 Wait patiently for the parents instructions about what the kid can eat, or their bedtime, then nod with a look that says, "Yes, yes of course."

, (or whatever time they are getting home, to show you were paying attention when they told you)"

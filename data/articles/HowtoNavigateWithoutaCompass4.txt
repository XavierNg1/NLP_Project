 You can look for natural landmarks, like mountains, lakes, and rivers. You can also look for manmade landmarks like roads, buildings or bridges.


You can also try to line up a landmark with another landmark further away. Keep the landmark in line with the more distant landmark as you travel to be sure you are going straight.
If you have a map, orient the map in the direction you are facing. North is usually up at the top of a map.
Walking straight may seem easy, but without a means of getting their bearings people tend to walk in circles while thinking they are traveling in a straight line., When you reach it, make a mark in the direction you came from. Use a stick and scratch a line in the dirt., Look for a hill, a tall tree, or any distinguishing feature in the direction you are heading. Be sure it lines up with your line in the dirt. Continue walking toward the landmark.
 When you get to the new landmark, look back to the last landmark and draw a line in the dirt. Line up a new landmark in front of you from the line in the dirt. Using this technique, you can continue to travel in a fairly straight direction so you can avoid becoming lost.
 Moss will grow only on the north side of a tree. Deciduous plants tend to populate the southern slopes of hills while coniferous trees cover the north. These phenomena occur in the opposite manner in the southern hemisphere. Plant life signs may help you to determine your direction of travel, but it is not very imprecise. Though you shouldn't rely on these occurrences entirely when navigating, it can come in handy when other methods fail.

 A very light shade of graphite is ideal to prevent the marks from showing through your paint. This is especially important if you paint with watercolours or other thin paint, which requires a 6H pencil or an even paler option.


It's okay to have faint pencil lines showing through watercolour, as long as they aren't too obvious. Some artists even use this intentionally, sketching in pencil then applying a very thin wash of paint over it.;
, Insert the pencil into a drawing compass. Place the compass point against the paper and carefully rotate the compass to draw a precise circle.


Alternatively, place a circular object flat against the canvas and trace around it.
 Paint inside the pencil marks carefully, with a thin brush. If the pencil lines are dark enough to stand out, you can instead wash over the whole sketch, letting the pencil communicate the shape.

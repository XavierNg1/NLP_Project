 If you found that your partner was insistent from the outset on physical intimacy (sex) and didn't hide this urgent need but insisted on pressuring you, this is a sign of the potential for exploitation. If you gave in to this insistence or willingly surrendered to your date, even though in the back of your mind you did not want to do so, this likely established a pattern of demanding that you concede and having you do so. You followed your partner's lead because you thought it was fine to do so.;
, Even if he or she did, you had to persuade him or her and ask him or her to do so. When he or she did, it would be during "major events" such as Valentine's Day, your birthday or his or her birthday. Maybe there is a series of "break-ups" prior to such events, with make-ups after the event has taken place, making gift giving easy to avoid.
Your partner asks you to invest for him or her with Your Money.
Your partner asks you to purchase everything for him or her, from food, for his or her cats/dogs/pets to his or her desktop Mac and laptop, clothing, costly sunglasses in an expensive brand and gifts for his or her family during Christmas.
You agree to almost all of your partner's requests to go for a mini-vacation with him or her and end up paying for them all. Make sure that you get all the rewards where you both stayed - that's the best you can do for yourself so you can apply the points towards your next break away from him or her––for good!
Your partner asks you to pay for his or her monthly car payment or other expenses he or she has.
He or she asks for your credit/debit card and also your PIN number so he or she can use it towards anything possible in your absence.
The relationship starts to evolve more with what he or she wants and how much he wants you to spend on him or her than us. You just cannot catch a break from not paying anything or everything for him or her.
 When a person introduces you too soon to his or her friends and family, this can be an alert for you. It may be because his or her biological clock is ticking and he or she is being exceptionally desperate or obsessive. If your partner introduces you so suddenly within a week or a month when you have not yet been given the chance to know more of who your partner is, etc., this is a red flag. It's an attempt to get you to think he or she is serious with you. No matter how hot the sex is between the two of you and how insanely handsome or beautiful he or she is, do not be clouded by this particular action. If you're considering it in retrospect, put this action in with the others to determine whether or not you're being used.
 If your partner constantly makes you feel guilty if you do not comply or "obey" to his or her wants and needs, this is a sign of absolute manipulation. For example, your partner acts as if he or she knows it all and should things did not work-out, he or she will say, “I told you so. You should listen to me more often." Inducing guilt is a classic sign of manipulating a person to get preferred behavior and actions that benefits the manipulator.
 For example, if your partner makes a major purchase, such as an automotive purchase or a home, to give you an impression that you both are exclusive and that the purchase is for both of you, but failed to discuss this with you, watch out. Even if he or she used his or her own credit to attain it, the lack of any thorough discussion between the two of you is a warning sign that your wishes don't count and that he or she is seeking to boss you about. A balanced relationship requires two people to sit down and discuss the big things with each other.
 Sooner or later, when you realize that your partner's exploits diminish your personality and individuality, you'll also discover that you are no longer the happy and cheerful self which you were before. As much as you look forward to seeing him or her and spending time together, you may begin to dread it more and more. You become a person who you are not, possibly cagey, anxious and jumpy, and you may begin to become withdrawn from the outside world. Another possibility is that you neglect your other loved ones, such as your family, especially your children and work colleagues, because he or she becomes your priority. Remember that your family and friends deserve to share you in their lives. When you've lost all self-respect for who you are in the hope of keeping this manipulator happy, it's time to realize that you deserve to start feeling that you are worth it, and that what has happened to you owes much to having been exploited.
 Because of your blinded love for him or her, everything this person does and says can risk becoming endearing to you, and you no longer perceive the faults. You neglect to take notice of his or her mental, emotional and perhaps even physical abuse.


For example, if your partner has managed to brainwash you to believe everything he or she says, causing you to push aside your priorities such as your family, friends and work, then your personal life suffers a great deal. When he or she keeps chiding and criticizing every move you make because it is not according to what he or she desires you to be, see this as a red flag.
Note how often your partner shows loving care towards you. If he or she rarely compliments how you look but will carelessly say something along the lines of, "I would like to date someone else - how do you feel about that?", it's clear he or she isn't caring about you.
Does he or she listen to you? When you confide in him or her about your problem such as a tough day/week at work, he or she refuses to listen to what you have to say, or even he or she does, manages to turn the focus back on himself or herself, on how hard his or her life has been.
Is there abuse involved? If, when you decide not to give in to your partner with what he or she wants, he or she will start yelling at you and calling you names. In some cases, this may escalate to physically abusing you. Do not let physical abuse occur. Once you have established the emotional and mental abuse, immediately seek the help needed to get out of the abusive relationship before you get hurt. You do not deserve the harm.
 Because of your belief in this person and hope that the relationship might work, especially your "never ending love" for him or her, it is probable that you will do whatever it takes to make "sacrifices" for the relationship. In doing so, it is easy to become irrational and end up using all your funds from your retirement funds to your savings and everything else in between that he or she can convince you hand over. Worst of all is when you borrow money from your friends and family to support his or her "idealism of a perfect relationship". Seek immediate professional help in the case of financial losses before it gets too late. Do not commit anything illegal which will jeopardize you entirely; such relationship is never worth it!

, Until a manipulative partner gets what he or she wants (whatever that will be), he or she may seek to take power over you. This can include limiting the sexual intimacy which a normal relationship requires. A manipulative partner controls that aspect of the relationship to ensure that he or she gets what he or she wants.
 Men and women have mood swings from time to time but this is infrequent and shouldn't be a constant occurrence. In the case of manipulative behavior, he or she is likely to change moods daily.


Watch for change of plans. Say that you spend three days in a week with him or her. However, when you both made plans (usually he or she will make the plans), he or she will change it at the last moment. For example, he or she plans on going camping for the weekend and when the weekend comes along, your partner said he or she would rather you both go to the movies.
Notice his or her feelings for you. One day he or she will express undying love for you and wants to be married (even though he or she repeatedly scoffs at commitment) but the next day, he or she wants to date other people. This is all said to hurt you.
Notice the angelic behavior in public. In the presence of his or her family and friends, this person will be extremely charming and very loving towards you. Away from others, he or she will not show any affection at all and will repeatedly reinforce that you both are just friends.
Watch for jealousy. It is a common factor in any relationship but is also a good sign of exploitative behavior.


These mood changes will be more apparent and escalated throughout the relationship when he or she does not get his or her own way - whatever it is that your partner wants at the time in his or her agenda.

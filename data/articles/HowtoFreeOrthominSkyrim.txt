 Orthorn can be found locked up inside Fellglow Keep, a ruined fortress somewhere along the Whiteshore area. To get to the keep, take the road from the city of Whiterun all the way south until you reach the river.


Once you get to the river, head east and follow its lead. Keep following the river for a couple of miles until you see some mountains in the horizon. Stay with the river until you get to the foot of these mountains. Here you’ll find the entrance to Fellglow Keep.;
, Inside you’ll find several mages walking around; they will attack you once they see you. Kill these enemies, and from the entrance, make your way to the third chamber in the area to find the prison cells where Orthorn is locked inside.
 He’s imprisoned in the center cell, and you can talk to him through the bars. Once you get close enough to him, press the “Interaction” button on your controller (displayed on the game screen) to talk to him. He’ll tell you all about the books he stole and that he’s willing to help you.


This step is optional though and you can go free him without talking to him first.
 Right in front of Orthorn’s cell are three levers. Approach these levers and activate the middle one using the interaction button again. This will open up the prison cell door, setting Orthorn free.
 Once you free him, Orthorn will tell you that he will aid in in reclaiming the lost books. Just keep silent to let him tag along. If you don’t want his aid though, select “I don’t want your help” from the response list and he will be on his way back to Winterhold.

 Also, if there is any dry skin on the area you will apply on, moisturize it with a thin non-oil based moisturizer. Makeup looks unpolished on top of flakes. If you choose to use foundation, use a light and thin one. Before you start this, you should also have no makeup on as well. This includes face makeup and mascara, before you start the makeup fun!;
, Not very much, you only want just a bit of color. Sixties makeup is all about the eyes, so use face makeup sparingly. Be sure to pick the right shade. Smile as you apply this. Start out by dabbing, and once you apply the desired amount while smiling, smear in with the clean brush or your fingers/hand. Make sure both the cheeks have an even amount.

 Once you're ready to start, install the solar panels. Choose the best type of panel for you and get enough of the to produce the amount of power you need. This is another area where a professional (or at least an expert) can be really helpful, as there is a lot of math involved in figuring out the necessary number of panels.
 You will need to connect the panels to a charge controller. This controller will help regulate the amount of power in the system, keeping your batteries from becoming damaged.
 Assuming you have DC batteries, you can connect your charge controller to your batteries. If you have AC batteries, you'll need to connect your inverter first (see next step).
 If you live in an area where AC power is used, you'll need to connect your batteries to an inverter, which converts the DC current created by the panels into useable AC power. You can then connect your inverter to your main power supply or connect your appliances to the batteries directly, depending on the type you got.


If using AC batteries, connect the inverter to the panels directly and then the invert to the charge controller.
 Once everything is safely connected, you can introduce power to the system by connecting the solar panels to the charge converter. In the end, the panels should connect to the charge converter, which connects to the batteries, which connect to the inverter, which connects to your main system.

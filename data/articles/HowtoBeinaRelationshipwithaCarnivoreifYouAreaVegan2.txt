 Some people that you have just met may wonder how you could have given up bacon/steak. These people usually seem to accept a shrug and a short explanation of how you did it. If they are interested, they may ask for an explanation of your reasoning for why you became vegan or vegetarian or what your diet or lifestyle entails. Tell them what you are comfortable telling them.


Be careful of talking about it too much. Their curiosity may be a way to invite a conversation, and conversation is never as fun when one subject is discussed too much.
 People are more likely to respond badly if they feel that you're attacking their omnivore lifestyle. Make it clear that this was your personal choice, and you don't hold their diet against them.


"I researched vegetarian lifestyle and found that it really fit me and my beliefs."
"I was having some health issues and my doctor recommended going vegan."

, These are the strangers who are overly familiar, family and friends who go too far, and and so forth. Standard procedures apply:


Ignore them.
Laugh it off with a "Well, everyone's different."
If they are persistent, stand up for yourself. Always be respectful when doing this, and never assume anything about them or be judgmental. Judgement, although tempting, invites full-blown fighting and hurt feelings. As important as food is, it is not worth it to make people feel bad about themselves.

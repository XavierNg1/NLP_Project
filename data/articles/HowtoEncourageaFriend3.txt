 You are not the boss of anyone but yourself and telling a friend they need to lose weight is rude and can lose you their friendship. People are going to make their own decisions and at a certain point they need to be allowed to decide what they need for themselves.This is true even if their weight has become a health problem. Chances are they recognize that it's a problem and if they want to do something about it, they will.
 When a friend is committed to losing weight they will need the support from their friends. If they're willing to share with you, find out as much as you can about the diet and exercise regime they're undergoing.Commit to exercising with them. Tell them that you'll bike to work with them, or go for a run in the evenings every day. Go to the gym with them and offer encouragement.
Eat the dishes that they prepare, or some of their diet food with them so that they don't feel so isolated in their food choices.
 It isn't your job to monitor how they're doing. Unless they specifically ask you to do this, don’t focus on how they’re doing, what they’re eating, when the screw up, and so on. You aren't the diet police. You're here to support and encourage them, not take them to task.


Cheer on the little victories and the things they accomplish.
Avoid criticizing when they fail to do something right. If they eat the wrong foods or go a little slack on their exercising, that isn't your job to tell them to shape up.
 When they've lost some weight, or when they've managed to step up their exercise program, make sure you celebrate that. Make sure that these celebrations don't focus on and aren't centered around food.


Take them out to a movie, or buy them a pedicure, or that lovely new book they've been craving.
 When you talk to them, don't focus on the diet, on what they've accomplished or where they've fallen short. Instead, ask how they've been doing (them as a person), how their dog is doing, how their schooling is going, and what the new changes are at the job.


Remember: whether they succeed or fail with losing weight, this is your friend. Their life shouldn't have to revolve around weight-loss and how much they weigh.
 It's tempting to show someone how much you're there for them by giving them lots of "helpful" ideas for how to do things better, or giving them exercise plans and weight-loss books. Don't do this.


It’s better to ask what they need, and simply be there for them, than to push in where you’re not wanted.

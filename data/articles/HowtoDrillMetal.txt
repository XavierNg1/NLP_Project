 High speed steel (HSS) bits will work for most kinds of metal, as will carbon steel bits coated with titanium nitride (TiN). For very hard metals, use a cobalt steel bit.

, This step is not necessary if drilling into a large, heavy steel object like a wall or stud.
 Measure this area with precision, since it's harder to patch a mistake in metal than to patch one you've made in wood.
 Hit it lightly with the hammer to mark your drill point and create a starting divot.
 The chances are small, but the sparks thrown by drilling metal can sometimes start small fires. A nearby fire extinguisher will help you keep a small fire from getting out of control.
 You may also want to wear a long-sleeved shirt with a closed collar as well.
 Make certain it's set level to the drill angle you want. Newer drills will have integral leveling bubbles to help with this.
 For hard metals, drill slowly and steadily. Soft metals will require a faster speed because the metal shaving may melt if you go too slowly. Even with soft metals, don't us a speed higher than medium.
 Keep the bit spinning until you've removed it entirely from the metal.

 If the project involves staining a concrete floor, that means all furniture and area rugs are removed from the space. For concrete counter tops, remove all items from the counter top, and place them in another room or at least in a distant area of the same room, covering them with a drop cloth.;
, The idea is to smooth any rough spots and leave a more or less uniform face to the concrete. The sand will also remove any finishes that may already be on the surface, making it easier to stain the concrete.
 Sweep the area or use a shop vacuum to remove any loose particles. Then use the mop to apply a cleaning product that is especially formulated for use with concrete. Most brands of concrete cleaners will apply easily with a mop or a soft brush. Allow the concrete to dry before proceeding.
 When staining a concrete floor, this means using painter's tape along the baseboards of the room. If the project is staining concrete counters, use the painter's tape and butcher paper to protect the wall surface behind the counter.
 Mix the product in a basic pump style garden sprayer. Pump the stain onto the concrete using even strokes to make sure the surface is complete coated, but without creating any puddles. Allow the first round of spraying to set, and then look for any areas that are lighter than you prefer. Administer a second and even a third coat of the stain to create the look you want.
 Once the stain has set to your liking, apply a concrete sealant to the surface. A paint roller made with synthetic fiber rather than cotton fiber will make it possible to apply the sealant evenly and avoid streaking. Allow the sealant to set before attempting to move any furniture back into the area.

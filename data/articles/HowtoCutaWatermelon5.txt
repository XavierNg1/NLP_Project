 Find the midpoint of the watermelon and cut through it to separate your melon into halves. Then place each half on your cutting board with the rind facing up. Cut each half in half, lengthwise or crosswise.
 Use a melon baller or an ice cream scoop to scoop out the flesh of the watermelon. Place it into a bowl or tupperware container.








A seedless watermelon is best for this method, so you donâ€™t end up with seeds inside your melon balls. Alternatively, you can remove the seeds as you scoop out the fruit.
 Chilled melon balls are a wonderfully refreshing treat that the whole family is sure to enjoy.

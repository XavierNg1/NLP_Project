 This will get any of the tangles and kinks out of the cord.

The object of this step is to ensure that the extension cord is not full of twists, kinks and entanglements.;
, Do not connect them, though.
 Then use your other hand to run down the cord to the halfway point to get anymore kinks out of the cord before you begin to wrap the cord.,, Pull through the loop partially creating another loop., You should be holding the loop with your right hand.
 The base is the part of the loop where the halfway point meets the other part of the cord.,,, Youâ€™ll see the start of a chain beginning which is what makes this method so special.
, Remember to have your palm up every time you grab the cord. This will make another loop, thus creating another link in the chain.,, Try to keep your loops consistent sizes so that you create a better chain for storage.

Notice how each chain is a similar size. Try to keep that size as you make each link in the chain. Depending on how long of an extension cord will determine the size of the loop, since you don't want to be looping small links for relatively long cords.
 As you get closer to the two ends, your last loop will be different.

Grab the cord like you have for the previous steps.
Pull the cord through to make a small loop (depending what you are left with in length).
Separate the female end and male ends.
Put one end through the loop.






Connect the ends.
 Now the cord is secure, it is up to the user where to store it. You can hang it up, or bundle it.

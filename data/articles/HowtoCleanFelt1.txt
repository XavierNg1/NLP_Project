 Whether the issue is food crumbs, dirt, mud or any other non-staining spillage, it must be allowed to dry before proceeding.If you attempt to clean the item before the spillage has dried, the substance will likely get ground into the fibers of the felt, making clean up far more difficult.


Doing this could also result in ruining your felt item completely.
If you suspect that the spillage will cause a stain, immediately skip to the spot cleaning and hand washing methods.
Stains must be addressed promptly for successful removal from felt.;
, Once the spillage is dry, shake off or brush away all loose debris from your felt item.Take care not to accidentally mash any debris into the fiber of the felt.


You can simply use your hand to brush debris away, especially if the issue is very minor.
Use a soft bristled brush to gently brush away any stubborn debris.
Also try flicking the felt item from the back (if possible) to get off stubborn debris.
 Everything, especially food particles, needs to be removed from the item. Allowing food particles to remain in the fibers of felt can lead to deep set staining, as well as pest or sanitation issues.


If additional debris is found upon closer examination, gently use the soft bristled brush again.
 This will clean any remaining debris from your item. Be very careful when wiping and avoid any aggressive scrubbing, since this can damage the surface of your felt.


The wipe wonâ€™t cause a lot of wetness to begin with, but still allow the moisture to air-dry before using or wearing your felt item.Do not air-dry in direct sunlight because this can damage the fabric.
 Persistent lint and hair can be eliminated by patting the sticky side of masking tape over the surface of the felt, then quickly pulling it off.


You will see the lint and hair transferred from the felt onto the tape.Repeat if necessary.

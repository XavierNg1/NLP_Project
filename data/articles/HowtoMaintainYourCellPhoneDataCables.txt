Data cable has two interfaces. One interface is for the connection of computers, and the other interface is for the connection of mobile phone. And their interface stitches are different. And stitch is thin which is easy to break. We must insert the interface carefully; otherwise if the stitch is broken, the data cable is useless.



Data ports have small stitches which belong to the metals products and be very vulnerable to get water and dust oxidation. Undeserved maintenance is easy to let the water and dust intrusion into the cable, resulting the data cable cannot work normally, download speed nature also slow.



Many users would like to crimp up the data cable for storage after using the data cable. Actually this is wrong. A data cable is made of plastic and aluminum foil shield which can't stand long time volume. Long time volume will cause the damage of the plastic layer or internal aluminum foil shield and reduce the service life of the data cable.

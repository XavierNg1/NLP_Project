 Draw a thin layer of white eyeliner directly on top of the blemish you wish to hide. Cover the blemish itself and any surrounding redness.


Use your fingers to blend the white liner into your skin. The area should appear much less red, but the white dot of liner will likely stand out.
 Apply concealer directly over the whitened blemish. Use your fingers to blend the concealer into the liner and into your skin.


As you blend in the concealer, both the remaining redness and the white liner should fade from view. The blemish should be even more hidden than it would be when you only use concealer.

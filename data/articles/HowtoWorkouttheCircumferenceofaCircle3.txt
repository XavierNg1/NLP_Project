 Most of the time, people don't measure the area (A) of a circle directly. Instead, they measure the radius (r) of the circle, then calculate the area using the formula A = πr2. The reason why this formula makes sense is a little tricky, but you can find out more here if you are interested and willing to tackle some tougher algebra.



Note: If the math problem does not tell you the area of the circle, you may need to use a different method on this page.
 The circumference (C) is the distance around the circle. Typically, you find it with the formula C=2πr, but because we don't yet know what the radius (r) is, we'll have to spend some time figuring out the value of r before we can solve it.
 Since A = πr2, we can rearrange this formula to solve for r instead. If the steps below are difficult for you to follow, you might want to start on some easier algebra problems or try some techniques for understanding algebra.


A = πr2

A / π = πr2 / π = r2

√(A/π) = √(r2) = r
r = √(A/π)

, Any time you have an equation, such as r = √(A/π), you can replace one side of the equation with the other. Let's use this technique to alter the circumference formula above, C=2πr. For this problem, we don't know the value of r, but we do know the value of A. Let's change it like this to make the problem solvable:


C = 2πr
C = 2π(√(A/π))

, Use the area given by the problem to solve for the circumference. For instance, if the area (A) of a circle is 15 square units, enter 2π(√(15/π)) into your calculator. Remember to include the parentheses.


The answer for this example is 13.72937... but unless instructed otherwise you can round to 13.73.

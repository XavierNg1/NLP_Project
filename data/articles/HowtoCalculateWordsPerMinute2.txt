 If you're trying to figure out how many words per minute you can read, once again, your best bet is generally to use an online speed reading test program. These are a little less common than typing speed tests but plenty of good ones can still be found with search engine queries like "reading words per minute."


One great program is available at readingsoft.com.In this program, you time yourself while you read a text of predetermined length. Once you finish, the program calculates your WPM based on how quickly you reached the end.
 As above, it's also possible to find the WPM you read manually. To do this, you'll want to open a word processor, paste a page or two of text into it (preferably something you haven't read before), then get ready to start a stopwatch.


Before you begin, use your word processor's "word count" feature to determine how many words are in your text selection. Record this number — you'll need it at the end.
A good place to find long text selections you haven't read before is on your favorite news website. Since the news is constantly updated, you won't have to wait long to find something you haven't read yet.
 When you're ready, start timing yourself and begin reading the text at your normal reading speed. Unless you're specifically trying to see your maximum reading speed, you shouldn't rush yourself — this won't give you an accurate picture of how fast you read in your day-to-day life.
 Stop the stopwatch as soon as you read the very last word in the text. Now, just use the same formula as above to find your WPM: # words/# minutes.


For example, if it took us three minutes to read a 1,100-word news article, we would find our WPM by dividing 1,100/3 = 366.7 WPM.

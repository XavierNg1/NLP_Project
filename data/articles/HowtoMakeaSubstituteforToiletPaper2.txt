 Spray yourself clean with a peri bottle, or any other water-spraying device. You can find a peri bottle in a pharmacy or baby supply aisle., Most leaves are scratchy and unpleasant. A few species are soft enough to earn the names "cowboy's" or "lumberjack's toilet paper." Look these up in a local wildlife guide before your camping trip:


Common mullein (Verbascum thapsus), found throughout the world.Lamb's ear (Stachys byzantina), native to Asia but cultivated in most temperate climates.Pine needles still attached to the branch.This may not be as comfortable as other options, but the natural brush shape makes it easy to wipe.
Moss is comfortable, but messy if it falls apart., An oval river stone is a common wiping tool in cultures without toilet paper. It sounds strange, but these are easy to find and comfortable to grip. Just make sure not to point any sharp edges at the wrong place.

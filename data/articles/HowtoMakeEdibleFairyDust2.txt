 Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper.
 Pour in 10 drops of food coloring, adding gradually until you are happy with the resulting color. (This might mean you add less or more of the food coloring drops.)

, Be sure to mix well enough to cover all of the sugar.
 Spread across it evenly, breaking down any clumps with the back of the fork.
 Bake for 8 to 10 minutes.
 Again, break down any clumps using the back of the fork. Allow to cool completely.
 The edible fairy dust is now ready for use as a decoration on cakes or cookies, etc., or for other uses. If not using straight away, keep in an airtight container.

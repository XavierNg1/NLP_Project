 You can find them on eBay for around $100 USD, or maybe even in your desk drawer.
 They're available at the AT&T store, eBay, Target, Best Buy, and many other retail electronics stores. The phone itself is not important—only the SIM card—so get the cheapest phone you can find.
 Make sure your GoPhone is powered down as well.
 On the top of the iPhone, next to the earphone socket, is a tiny hole. Insert an unbent paper clip into the hole, and push down: the SIM tray will pop out. Remove the SIM, noting how it is oriented in the tray.
 Follow the instructions included with the GoPhone for details.
 Put the GoPhone SIM into the iPhone SIM slot, and close it back up.
 You are now on your prepaid GoPhone plan! You will also still be able to use Wi-Fi to connect to the internet.
 SIM cards generally have wireless services disconnected, but try this:


Find a Wi-Fi hotspot, and launch Safari on your Go-iPhone.
Navigate to unlockit.co.nz, and tap Continue, then tap Custom APN.
From the list of carriers, choose "US-AT&T" or your local carrier, whichever is appropriate.
Tap Create Profile to create and download the APN file.
At the prompt, choose "Install," and then "Replace."
When you see the "Profile Installed" screen, restart your iPhone.
When it's restarted, go to Settings, and disable Wi-Fi. Check the on the upper left of the iPhone screen, and it should say Edge or 3G.

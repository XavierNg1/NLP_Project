 You'll need this to run the latest DLL exploits in ROBLOX. You can download it from microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145.


Most Windows computers that are somewhat modern already have this preinstalled.;
, Many of the exploits you download are written with this. You can download it for free from microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653.
 You'll need a couple of Visual Studio debug DLLs in order to inject your exploits.


Download msvcr100.dll from dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr100. The file will download in ZIP format.
Download msvcr100d.dll from dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr100d. The file will download in ZIP format.
 Double-click each downloaded file and extract the DLL file inside. Place them on your desktop for now to find them easily.
 You'll need to place the DLL files into the correct system folder. If you aren't sure if you're running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows, press âŠž Win+Pause and look at the "System type" entry.


64-bit (most modern computers) - C:\Windows\SysWOW64

32-bit - C:\Windows\System32


, This will allow Windows to inject your exploits while you're running the game.
 These utilities scan for currently-running programs and then allow you to inject your DLL into a specific process, such as ROBLOX. This loads the DLL code into the game, letting you run the exploit. There are several DLL injectors that will work with ROBLOX exploits:


dllinjector.com
Extreme Injector

,

For most exploit forums, you'll need to create an account before you are able to view forum posts or download links.
, There are free working exploits out here, but most of them are unstable or almost completely broken. The highest quality exploits out here, such as Elysian, Intriga or Cerebrus, requires payment before gaining access to the software.


Most transactions occur using Skype, PayPal or Discord. There is no guarantee that you're not going to get ripped off, or that the exploit won't be fixed the next day by the ROBLOX developers.
Avoid cracked versions of these exploits. Most cracks are scams or viruses, and exploit authors have been known to do unkind things to people who crack the paid exploits.
 ROBLOX gets updated often to fix exploits, and exploits that work one week may not work the next. New exploits are released all the time, and free ones come and go. If you're desperate for a free ROBLOX exploit, you should keep tabs on the forums for new posts.
 Using an exploit from your main account is asking to have it banned, so you should always use exploits from dummy accounts. Make sure there is no information in the account that can link it back to your main., Using exploits can get your IP address banned from ROBLOX, which will affect any of your accounts. Consider using a proxy or VPN to hide your IP address before connecting to ROBLOX and using exploits.

See Be Online Anonymously for tips on masking your home IP address.
 Having your DLL injector running before you start ROBLOX will make the process a little easier. You'll see a list of the currently-running programs appear in the DLL injector window. It may take a few moments for the list to populate.
 Click the "Add DLL" or "Select DLL" button and browse the exploit DLL that your downloaded or received. This will load it into the injector and have it ready to go when ROBLOX is running.
 ROBLOX needs to be running before you can inject your exploit DLL. Start the game and load the room you want to test your exploits in., You don't want a room that's too populated, or you run the risk of getting reported quicker. You'll need at least a few people to test commands on., Look for the RobloxPlayerBeta.exe process in the list and select it. This will tell the DLL injector which process to inject the DLL into.
 This will inject the exploit DLL file into the ROBLOX process. For most exploits, the command window should appear if the DLL was injected successfully.If the injection fails, make sure that you've installed everything listed in the first section of this article. The exploit could also have been patched by the ROBLOX developers, rendering it useless.
 You can usually type something like cmds to see a list of possible actions you can take with the exploit. These commands could include invincibility, noclip, superjump, and admin abilities like killing and kicking other players. The available commands will vary depending on the exploit.

Check out YouTube videos for the exploit you are using for some examples of commands you can use.
Check the ReadMe file that usually comes with the exploit for additional information on available commands.
 "Leeching" in the Roblox exploiting scene is the equivalent of receiving a product or a service and not thanking the one who served you. Most exploit developers out here who works fully pro bono simply expects a mere "thank you" if the one using the developer's exploit likes his work. This kind of behavior ("Leeching") is highly frowned upon in several Roblox exploiting communities. If you download a free exploit, make sure to send a "thank you" note to its creator!

 You'll need baby powder and crushed chalk. The chalk is an optional ingredient that is used to add color to your smoke bomb. Pick out whatever color of chalk you want the smoke to be. Use a variety of colors if you want multiple colors of smoke.
 Crush the chalk pieces if you haven't already done so. Be sure that the chalk is finely ground. You could grind the chalk in a food processor, or by hammering the chalk in a sealed plastic bag. Mix the chalk into the baby powder. Use about a handful of baby powder per tablespoon of chalk powder. Stir your powders until they are evenly mixed together.









Experiment with different proportions of baby powder to chalk.
Create multiple batches of colors. Don't feel limited to use one color for all of your bombs. Store the mixture in a tupperware container., Take a sheet of computer paper and fold it in half hot dog style. Unfold the paper, and place two tablespoons of your mixture onto the paper. The crease you created will help guide the powder into the shell without a mess.
 Flip your shell in the egg container so that the hole is facing you. Carefully shake the powdered mixture into the hole. Work slowly with the powder to avoid a mess. This step above anything else requires patience and a steady hand. Don't feel discouraged if you make a mess.








If it's difficult to fill, increase the size of the hole. Be careful not to create any cracks.
If you find clumps in the powder, smooth them out with a fork or by using a food processor.

 Arrowroot is a starch extracted from tropical fruit rhizomes. It's a fine powder and works really well as a last-minute gravy thickener. The arrowroot must be added to a little cold liquid and blended into a paste before being added to the hot gravy. , The beauty of arrowroot is that it will stay clear, which can be important for lighter colored gravy. You don’t have stir really hard, just keep the arrowroot in motion while your gravy comes to a boil.
 Any further cooking can have the reverse effect and thin the arrowroot. As soon as you see bubbles in the gravy remove the gravy completely from the hot stove plate. Don’t just turn the stove off and let the gravy sit on there – it will continue to boil! , Hopefully it has reached the consistency that you were looking for. Wait about ten to fifteen before serving your gravy so that it can cool down to an appropriate temperature. You want to be able to taste the flavor after all.

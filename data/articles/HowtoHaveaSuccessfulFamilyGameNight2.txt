 While some games are well-suited to young players, other games give adults an unfair advantage. For example, a young child may not stand a chance in a game of Scrabble against an adult because of the vast differences in their vocabularies. One thing that you can do to ensure that all players have a chance at winning is to make rule adjustments to suit the needs of younger players.Try teaming up younger players with an adult or older child player to help even the playing field. Or decide on an exception or rule adjustment for younger players, such as giving younger players a flat 20 points for each word played in Scrabble, regardless of size or complexity.
 Cheating can be a problem for some children because they really want to win the game. Make sure that you have some clear consequences for anyone caught cheating to help make it clear that it is not okay. For example, you might specify that anyone caught cheating has to do the dishes at the end of the night., Since the goal of a family game night is to spend quality time with your family and enjoy their company, it is a good idea to ban all electronic devices during game night. That means cell phones, TVs, tablets, or anything else that might distract players from the game should be shut off and out of sight.If you have trouble getting your family members to observe this rule, try setting a consequence. For example, you might say that anyone caught using a device during family game night has to wear a silly hat for the rest of the evening. If that doesnâ€™t work, try a more serious consequence like losing a turn or getting a points deducted. Just make sure that you make the consequence clear before you start the game night.

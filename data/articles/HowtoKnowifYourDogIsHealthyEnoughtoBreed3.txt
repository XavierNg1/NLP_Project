 If you have a female dog that you are breeding you need to make sure that it is getting proper health care throughout its pregnancy. This means following the suggestions from your veterinarian about prenatal and postnatal care, including how often it should be brought in for a veterinary exam.A veterinarian will be able to assess whether the pregnancy is going well and if any alterations to the dog's health care or diet are needed.
Your veterinarian may also do an ultrasound or X-ray of the dog to see how many puppies you should expect the dog to deliver.
 You should feed a high quality food to a dog that you are attempting to breed. This will assure that it is getting the nutrients it needs to have a high functioning reproductive system. Once the dog is pregnant, it should be switched over to a high calorie puppy food in order to get enough nutrition.In addition, you will need to increase your dog's food intake throughout its pregnancy. Generally, a pregnant dog's food will need to be increased by fifteen to twenty five percent over the course of its entire pregnancy.
 It is important that you know what to expect during labor and delivery so that you can assess whether they are going well or if there is a problem. While the dog is in labor and while it is delivering its puppies you should be present if possible and keeping an eye on your dog's energy level and overall health.While your dog is pregnant, discuss what to expect with your veterinarian and ask him or her any questions that you have about the process.
Call your veterinary office immediately if you suspect a health problem with your dog while it is giving birth. The veterinary staff should be able to discuss the problems you are concerned with and they should be able to recommend whether or not to bring your dog in to the veterinary office.

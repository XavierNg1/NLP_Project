 This is the single most important step; remember, you can laugh as much as you want over a joke by yourself in a quiet place, in your own mind, or at home, but when a person tells you a joke, or something funny or joyful, don't smile or laugh. Be nice, express your emotions by your words, and not by your facial expression.;
,, Make sure to speak clearly and to only use formal speech. Always address teachers, your peers, and others by their proper names, unless they specifically ask otherwise.
 Sometimes girls come up to you and act like they are overly friendly, (ex. "Hi Fred! How was your day?"). Maybe they even giggle at you behind your back. They might act as if they think you're "cool" and want to hang out with you, but in reality they may just think of you as a "dork" and/or a "loser." If this ever happens to you, simply ignore it; don't smile, frown or show any facial expression, and respond as you would to a typical conversation; "Things are going well. How are you today?" or "I have a lot of work. Have a good day". A polite response that is neither rude nor submissive will win in the long game.
 Being a high achiever will give the impression of "professionalism", another box now ticked, it will also benefit you later in and all throughout your life.
, During class, do not speak to anybody unless spoken to by a teacher, and only a teacher.
 Choose a desk at the far back of the class, a desk by itself away from your class group, but not so far to the point where you aren't able to pay attention or can't see what the teacher is teaching.
 Be cautious of the fact that you could be making these "indications" up in your own mind. However, if he/she really is interested in you, then continue with your technique, and perhaps be a little extra friendly to him/her.

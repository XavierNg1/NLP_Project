 She will/may be starting her period soon so you need to have the products for it. Pads and/or pantyliners are your best bet for her first few periods.;
, Make sure she knows where these products go, when to change them, and overall how to use them.
 Some moisturizers and cleansers for her face. Teach her how to wash her face well without drying her face out. Try to get her in a habit of using these products.
 She is growing up and she might want a bra herself, but is embarrassed to ask. This gives her an open door to get one. Make sure to get one that fits and maybe help her the first time she wears one to school, or until she gets the hang of it. This doesn't mean dress her like you did when she was younger, just help her latch it up in the back and tighten the straps if they fall or loosen them if they are to tight.
 She may not understand, she may think she smells "fine." But she is going to need deodorant because she is going to get a lot sweatier these days.
 If you feel she may need it then at least try it, she may have underarm hair and hairy legs but not know what to do and be embarrassed to do things with her friends like swimming or anything where you wear shorts! Don't hold her back, get her a razor and teach her how to use it, when to use it, how much shaving cream to use, etc.

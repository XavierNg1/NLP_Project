 It is generally always safer for your cat to be indoors than outdoors. Cats in rural areas can come upon electric fences intended for livestock, and cats in cities can come across downed power lines or stray voltage from leaking utilities. If you want to let your cat outside, do so in a fenced backyard and supervise them to ensure their safety., Curious cats may scratch at wall outlets. While shock from this is a more minor risk, you can buy outlet protectors for peace of mind. These plastic covers—often intended for baby proofing—have prongs that plug into your outlet much like a normal plug, blocking access to the current., Faulty electrical wiring is a hazard to both you and your cat. If any wiring in your home looks suspect, perhaps tinkered with by a DIY-inclined previous homeowner, call an electrician to have it examined for safety. Always get your electrical work performed by a licensed electrician.


Signs of faulty wiring include flickering, buzzing or dimming lights, or excessive circuit-breaker trips.If there are any exposed wires in your home, cover the areas with coated electrical tape until you can call an electrician.

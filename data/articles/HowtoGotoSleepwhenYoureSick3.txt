 A humidifier is a machine that produces a mist or steam, increasing the humidity or moisture in the air. The moisture in the air keeps your mucus loose, making it easier for air to get through your nasal passages as you sleep.The noise created by a humidifier might keep you awake, though, so look for a quiet machine. If you're buying a new one, look for online reviews to get an idea of whether it is noisy.
Try keeping the humidifier just outside your bedroom door; this way, you’ll still have some moisture in the air, and the noise will be reduced.
 Extreme temperatures — either hot or cold — will keep you from getting a good night’s sleep. Your brain, which regulates your body temperature without you even thinking about it, tries to achieve different internal temperatures when you are awake versus when you’re asleep. Reducing the external temperature slightly will help your body gear down for rest.The ideal temperature for sleep is 68°F (20°C).
 Though you may think that reading a book or watching TV will help you get to sleep, the light from both of those activities will actually keep you awake longer. When your eyes take in and process light, the nervous system stimulates the parts of the brain that control hormones and body temperature. When this happens, your body chemistry stays wired up for consciousness, and you’ll find it more difficult to fall asleep.When it’s time to go to bed, turn off all light sources and cover up any technology that may have blinking lights that will keep your brain engaged.
Stop using all electronic devices — including phones, tablets, and laptops — at least 30 minutes before bed, if not a few hours, as the blue light emitted from the screens will keep you awake.
 If someone else in your home is listening to music or watching TV with the volume up high, ask them to turn down the volume enough to keep you from hearing it in your bedroom. The less distractions you have, the better chance you’ll have of getting to sleep.

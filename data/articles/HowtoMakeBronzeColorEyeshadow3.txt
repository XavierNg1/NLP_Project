 Add a little powder to foundation, and put it on your eyes for a long-lasting liquid eyeshadow. Russet and olive skin tone foundations appear bronze, and, like eyeshadow, you can mix different colours, but there will be no visible shimmer.
 This comes in brown and gold shades, but may be too thick and it will be difficult to find the right shades.
 As you can tell by the name, this would be the best way to imitate bronze eyeshadow. Most bronzers come with glitter/shimmer, which reinforces the bronze quality. You get get bronzer in powder or liquid.
 Very subtle and often scented, and gives a golden sheen that could look like bronze, but is very subtle.
 Lasts the longest of all of the other options, and is available in various shades, but will be difficult to get off.

 Fiber is extremely important to a healthy diet. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to get lots of fiber aside from the whole grains one might otherwise eat in bread. Some of the best sources of fiber, in fact, are beans. Split peas, lentils, black beans, and Lima beans have especially high amounts of fiber.Beans are also especially easy to add to all sorts of dishes. Use mashed lentils, for instance, to make a patty with lemon juice, cilantro, and walnut pieces.
Add black beans to your morning eggs to add both fiber and additional protein.
 If, like most people, you enjoy eating, an entree alone might not leave you fully satisfied. For especially contentment-inducing sides, steam or bake some veggies. Those that are high in fiber, such as artichoke, broccoli, and brussel sprouts, will be particularly filling.Steaming veggies is the healthiest preparation method. For instance, steam lightly salted broccoli and season them with turmeric for a savory and delicious side.
 Bread gets a lot of love in part because it is cheap, filling, and easy to carry and snack on. Of course, there are other healthier food categories that offer these benefits as well. Get in the habit of snacking on fresh fruit or slices of cucumber or bell pepper instead of a roll or other bread item.Raspberries, blackberries, and pears are especially high in healthy, filling fiber.
For an extra flavor burst, dip veggies in hummus. This snack will offer the satiating effects of fiber that will quickly quell any mid-afternoon hunger.

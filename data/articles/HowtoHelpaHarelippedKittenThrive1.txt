 If your kitten has a harelip, the teeth and gums may be showing on the upper part of the mouth. One of the kitten’s nostrils may be misshapen, especially if it is connected to a deformed upper lip.This should be apparent at birth.;
, Harelips often occur with cleft palates. A cleft palate can be easily seen. Look inside the kitten’s mouth. The kitten has a cleft palate if there is a split in the roof of the mouth.The hole may be small or large. Look for a circular opening in the middle of the roof of the mouth.
 Harelips and cleft palates may cause respiratory problems. The kitten may sneeze, cough, gag, or make snuffling sounds often. You may need to watch the kitten closely for a while to see if they exhibit any respiratory problems.They may also cough, gag, snort or sneeze when they eat or drink.
 Harelips cause kittens to have trouble eating or drinking water. They may not be able to feed properly because the harelip makes it so they can't attach to the nipple and get any suction. This causes them to not get the food they need to grow. This can lead to stunted growth and lower weights.They may also end up with fluid in their nose while feeding. This may present as a runny nose. This can lead to pneumonia or death.

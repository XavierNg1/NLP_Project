 Test it for strength and flexibility. Try to see if fish seem to venture close to the area.
 You will need two sticks with carved out mouths and several feet of wire. The only difference between this method and the hook trigger method is that you must make sure the soil is compact and will not erode away while your trap is waiting for its target.
 Instead of a noose, you will be using your baited line to catch fish. The bait dangles in the water and the top of your line rests on the hook, ready to fly into the air upon even the slightest of tugs.


Make sure algae or seaweed won't mess up your trap. Try to clear the area of any needless shrubbery that could trigger your snare unnecessarily.

 It’s easier to reduce the chances you will get a sick stomach on an airplane in the first place. .


Airports don’t have a lot of great food options, but downing a fast-food meal before flying is a recipe for an upset stomach on board.Better choices are natural foods, like carrots and nuts. It’s harder to digest foods full of salt and saturated fat while flying. Avoid eating food that causes gas and bloating, such as fried foods, but also avoid foods like baked beans, cauliflower, and onions.
Avoid anything you have an intolerance for; for example, if you’re lactose intolerant, avoid dairy. , If you fly on an empty stomach, you might feel sick to it. Try to eat something but make it something bland.Snack on pretzels. Bring some along, although most airlines offer them while you’re on board. If you're feeling sick, ask the flight attendant for some crackers.Strive to eat foods that are higher in protein, such as a peanut butter sandwich, meat, or fish. These will fill your stomach and settle it.
If you didn’t bring any food along, don’t reject the airline meal completely. Nibble on fruit or crackers, at least.
 Just in case, bring along some Pepto Bismol when you fly. That way, if your stomach is feeling sick, you’ll be prepared.


Remember that Pepto Bismol comes in chewable form, which is obviously a better choice on a plane than a liquid bottle. You could also purchase motion sickness bands. These bands work because they have a small knob on the inside that applies constant pressure to reduce nausea.
Take an over the counter medicine like Gas-X or other Anti-Gas pills if you’re worried you’re going to get a sick stomach in the air. It’s not recommended to fly if you’ve recently had stomach surgery.Be aware if you have chronic intestinal inflammation that some studies have found that travel can lead to bouts of it, partly due to the lack of oxygen in an airplane.

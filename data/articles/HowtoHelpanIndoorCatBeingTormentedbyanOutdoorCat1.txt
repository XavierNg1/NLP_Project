 It should be fairly obvious if your cat is upset. It may hiss or yowl. It might also puff up its fur, a tactic designed to make it look bigger and more menacing to other animals. It may also become more aggressive, attacking you or other family members (human or animal) because it can't take out its aggression on the outdoor cat., One way to try to calm your cat is to spend some time petting it. Gently stroke the cat in its favorite places, talking soothingly to it as you do. Use long strokes, going from the head to rump. For some cats, that may be all you need to calm them down.


Obviously, if your cat tries to attack you, back away, and let it have some space.
 While your cat may enjoy watching the birds, you may need to block its view of the outside for a while. Though your cat will likely still be able to smell the other cat, not being able to see it may keep your cat from getting as crazy, calming it down.You may need to do more than close the blinds since cats are persistent creatures. For instance, purchase dark window clings to cover the window. Use them on the part of the window at your cat's level, and leave the top of the window open for a view.
 Cats need entertainment, just like you do. That's one reason your cat is looking outside: it wants to see what's going on. However, you can help keep your cat's focus indoors by providing more interesting toys. Often, simple toys will suffice, such as boxes and paper bags.However, sometimes upgrading toys can interest your cat. For instance, puzzle toys that release treats as your cat plays with them are a great way to keep your cat entertained.
 If the outdoor cat is mainly in one area (the front or the back of the house), considering keeping your cat out of that area for a while. Keep the door closed so your kitty can't venture in there and be annoyed by the outdoor cat.

 This is an appropriate way to get closer to a girl you don't know very well, or stay connected with a close friend.


Like her status updates, photos and covers.
Send her messages. If you bonded over something you do together, such as a sports team or tutor group then start off with something like "Well done at tennis today!" If you share interests then post something about that, such as "I though you might like this video about soccer! *link*" If you want to maintain a friendship, or are interested in her romantically then just talk to her like you would if you saw her at school, e.g. "How are you?" "I had a great time at the movies with you yesterday!" etc.
Post funny pictures/videos, links to websites or in-jokes to her wall.;
, Text her asking her about her day, or with a funny joke, or asking her to do something together. Talk about stuff that you have in common such as shared interests and school.
 Get Snap Chat, Skype, etc.

 Instead of slicing cucumber medallions, you can dice your cucumber by cutting it in half longways, and then cutting it in half longways again. Line the halves up horizontally on your cutting board and slice through the length of your cucumber to dice it.
 Dicing your cucumbers adds just one step to the Julienne cut you have already done. Take your julienne cuts and bunch them up with your hand. Then cut the julienne into equally shaped dice. That's it!


Aim for dimensions of about 2mm X 2mm X 2mm (1/16 in X 1/16 in X 1/16 in).
You can also dice your cucumbers into thicker pieces if you prefer.
 If you'd like to produce cubes, you can use whatâ€™s called the Medium dice to cut your Batonnet pieces.Hold each piece and cut cubes of about 6mm X 6mm X 6mm (1/4 in X 1/4 in X 1/4 in)


Aim to get your pieces as even as possible.
 If you would like smaller thinner cubes, slice each cube into about 12mm X 12mm X 3mm (1/2 in X 1/2 in X 1/8 in) squares from one side of the cube to the other., Use a sharp knife or vegetable peeler (recommended if you don't have experience in spiral cutting cucumbers) and begin peeling at one side in a circular motion. You should be creating a very thin peel. Continue until you have reached the end of your cucumber.


Be careful with the knife or vegetable peeler, always cut away from your hands and fingers.
Try to keep the shaving intact, but it's okay if it breaks off too.
If you'd like, you can use a knife or apple corer to take the seeds out before you begin peeling.
Spiral cut cucumbers are a fun way to garnish a salad. You can even dress spiral cut cucumbers with a light dressing and a little bit of pepper for a creative salad. Put spiral cut cucumbers on a sandwich or burger for a twist.
 Sliced and diced cucumbers make a great addition to salads or sprinkled on top of dishes. Bring a professional look to your dishes with these slicing and dicing methods.

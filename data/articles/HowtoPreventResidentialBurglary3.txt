 Connect lamps in different parts of the house to timers, especially lamps whose lights you can see from the street. Have them turn on during different parts of the day and night. This will give criminals the impression that someone is home.For example, have a lamp or two turn on at 7 p.m. and off at 11 p.m. to indicate that someone is home. Then have another lamp turn on 6 a.m. and off at 8 a.m.
You can also place a timer on your TV.
You can find timers at your local hardware store.
 Piles of these items indicate to criminals that you have been away from home. Have a neighbor, friend, or family member pick up these items while you are on vacation to make it seem as if you are home.Alternatively, contact the post office and have them hold your mail for you while you are gone.
If you will be gone for an extended period, like a month, then schedule someone to mow your lawn while you are gone as well.
 Parking your car in the garage makes it harder for a thief to decipher if you are home or not. Make sure to park your car(s) in the garage before you leave. Also try to park it in the garage regularly while you are home. This will make it even more difficult for a thief to know when you are or are not home.If you don’t have a garage or room for your car, then park your car in the driveway. Make sure to lock your car and remove valuable items from it before you leave.
 Ask them to keep an eye on your house while you are gone. If you have timers on your lights (or your TV), then let them know the timers’ schedule. This way, they will be able to tell if there is any suspicious activity going on inside of your house.Tell them to contact the police if they see or suspect any suspicious behavior.

 then draw two short, curving guidelines. Add a long oval for the body and a long skinny triangle for the tail. Don't forget the odd shapes for legs and the small claw shapes for feet.;
, Also draw the cere(nostrils) and beak. Draw the throat by simply connecting the body to the head.
 Your eye should be between your two guidelines. Make sure your wing ends over the top of the tail feathers. it might take a lot of erasing to get looking good, but that's fine.
 Also add lines to the tail to show the separate feathers.
 Also improve the feet and add a perch for your bird to stand on.

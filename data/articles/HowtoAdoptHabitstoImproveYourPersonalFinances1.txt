 Automate your payments to send 15% of your income each month into your savings account from your checking account. Set aside that money to save and live with the amount you have left. This way you save more easily and more regularly.;
, If you say you are going to put aside what you have left after spending what is necessary in a given month, you might never make it. Put aside money to save first, and calculate your spendings based on what you have left.
 For example, if you want to save € 50 per month, divide by 30 to get how much you need to save per day (€ 1.66). That's about the price of a cup of coffee - so have coffee at home rather than buying it. It is much easier to save € 1.66 per day than to save € 50 per month. Set a goal and deliberately adjust your spending to achieve it.
 The growth of your investments over time will be amazing if you start in your twenties. Create a pension account or a 401k, or pick another method of saving for your retirement. Do a little research to find out what will work best for you, but whatever you do, start now!

, A good education, though expensive, will help you find a better job. Investing in your knowledge and skills will be the best return you can get for your future. Remember to distinguish between investment and expenditure.
 Make paying off your debt a priority. If you're not careful, loans and credits can put you into a vicious cycle from which it can be very hard to escape. It is better to make efforts to avoid finding yourself in overwhelming debt in the first place.

Raise the car using a jack so that the wheel is off of the ground.
Remove the lug nuts and the wheel.
Spray the steel brake line fitting with penetrating oil to loosen any existing rust.



Remove the rubber plug behind the backing plate.
Loosen the self-adjuster (star wheel) to lower the brake shoes. If you turn the self-adjuster in the wrong direction, then the drum will get tighter and will not turn. Use a small flat head screwdriver to release the adjuster arm, if needed.
You may need to use a hammer to hit the middle of the drum to loosen any rust that surrounds the center piece.
Remove the drum.
Place a drip pan beneath the brake shoes. If the brake shoes are covered in fluid, you will need to replace them as well.
Spray the area with brake cleaner to eliminate dirt and fluid.



Prepare a vacuum hose to prevent brake fluid from leaking out of the steel brake line. Place a screw or bolt in one end.
Locate the steel brake line on the plate where it screws into the wheel cylinder and use a line wrench to loosen the brake line fitting.
Remove the fitting.
Place the vacuum hose over the line to prevent leakage.



Locate the two retaining bolts on the backing plate that hold the wheel cylinder in place.
Use a socket wrench to loosen the bolts.
Remove the old wheel cylinder.
Thread the steel brake line fitting into the new cylinder. Screw it in as far as you can by hand.
Insert the bolts back into the backing plate and screw them in to secure the new cylinder.
 See instructions in method six.

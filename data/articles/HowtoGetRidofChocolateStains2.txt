Allow the stain remover to break down the stain for up to 15 minutes if the colour stays in tact. If the solution produces a difference in colour from the rest of your garment, stop immediately.Wear gloves when handling hydrogen peroxide as it can be damaging to the skin., Turn the garment inside out and rinse repeatedly. Depending on the stain, your garment may need several cycles through your washer before it is completely removed.If it seems no stain was removed after the first wash, try leaving the peroxide solution on the stain for a longer period of time.

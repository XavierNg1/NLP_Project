 Pasta noodles are often flavored with rich, creamy sauces. Instead of reaching for Alfredo sauce, go for sauces made from oil and herbs. Drizzle some olive oil over your pasta and add sun dried tomatoes. Use a small amount of pesto for flavoring. Even just a few dashes of dried or fresh basil can bring out a great flavor without adding too many calories.Use only a small amount of any sauce you're using. Even healthy sauces, like pestos, can be high calorie due to the olive oil content.
 Plant-based sauces are generally healthier than rich, creamy sauces. Go for tomato-based sauces like marinara sauce. This will cut down on the fat and calorie content of your pasta.
 Many people love pasta with Alfredo sauce. However, Alfredo sauce is high in calories and fat. Thin down Alfredo sauce by using a recipe that calls for white wine instead of cream.You can also make a "pink" sauce by mixing one part tomato sauce to one part Alfredo sauce. This will give you a creamy consistency while cutting down on calories.
 Portions are generally bigger in restaurants and sauces and creams may be heavier. Opt for vegetable-based sauces, like tomato sauces, over things like Alfredo sauce and order smaller sizes. Even when you're ordering the smaller sizes, chances are the portions will be bigger than what you would eat at home. Make sure not to eat your entire serving at a restaurant. Take some home for later.You can share with a friend if it's hard to resist eating the full serving. You can also ask that the server bring half of the pasta already boxed up to take home.
Order a salad as an appetizer to cut down on how much pasta you eat at dinner. This will prevent you from eating the entire pasta dish. You can always take the leftovers home to reheat for another meal.

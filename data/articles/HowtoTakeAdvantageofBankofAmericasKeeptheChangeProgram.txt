 You will also need to figure in sales tax as you go. The idea is to always have your purchase total to just over a given round dollar amount (for example, $49.01). Another, somewhat lazier method is to have a few small items available that are worth, say, 80 or 50 cents, and then be prepared to void the purchase of one or more of those items, in order to make your purchase total as close to (but still above) a given dollar amount.;
, So for instance, if your total is $23.50, don't buy a candy bar to push the total over $24.00; subtract an item instead.
, Bank of America imposes a $250 matching limit for that period. Of course, since the most you can generate in any one purchase transaction is 99 cents, it might be impractical to reach that amount.
 Many merchants are charged for each debit card transaction. Plus, you will delay other customers from making their purchases (even if you use self-checkout), and will add to the workload of the store's employees (not just the cashiers, as all debit card transactions need to be logged and processed).

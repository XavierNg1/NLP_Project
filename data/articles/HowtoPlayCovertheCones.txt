 The field should be cut into two equal halves with a center line dividing them. The players are safe on their own side, but on the opposing teams side, they can be tagged. Parallel to the center line, at the end of each half there should be a safety line. If a player gets behind the opposing teams safety line, they are safe. The cones should be set up in a vertical line about five feet from the safety line. There should also be sidelines that if a player crosses, they are out of bounds.;
, The game works best with at least ten people on each team.
 Players can act as offense, defense, or both. However, it is wise to keep at least one person guard each cone with a ball on top of it.


Offensive players run into the opposing teams side. Their goal; grab a tennis ball and return it to their side. If they are tagged by an opposing player, or they step out of bounds, they become "frozen," and must stay where they are and cannot catch a tennis ball. Likewise, if a frozen player is tagged by a teammate, they become unfrozen and can run again. If a player passes the safety line, they cannot be tagged. They are safe as long as they have some part of their body in the safety zone. If a player manages to grab a tennis ball from the other team, they can either try to run it back to their side, or throw it to a team member on either side. They can go into the safe zone to make their throw. If they are tagged with the ball, the ball is returned to the cone and the player is frozen. If the throw hits the ground before it is caught, the ball is returned. If the player does manage to bring the ball to their side, they place it on an empty cone.
Defensive players stay on their own side. Their goal; tag opposing players and guard the tennis balls. You cannot touch your own tennis balls when they are on the cones. However, you can put them back if they fall or touch the ground and intercept it if an opposing player attempts to pass it.

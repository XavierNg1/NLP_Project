 You sweat while you sleep and that makes you stink. Use a good smelling soap and be sure to shave your underarms and legs if it's necessary. Use shampoo and conditioner, but not too much conditioner.;
, It's less painful to pluck after a nice hot shower. Next, dry your hair to about 95% dry so it doesn't completely dry out. Then, wash your face if you didn't in the shower.
 Make yourself smell good, but remember not to overdo it or mix scents.
, (Tip: never straighten your hair if it's wet. Sure, it saves time, but it makes your hair dry, which damages your hair, and gives it a straw-like appearance)

, If you have serious acne, go to the dermatologist or use an acne solution. It'll be the best thing you ever do for yourself. In the mean time, pat on some concealer with a light powder and go easy with the foundation.
 Choose to play up the lips or the eyes, never both. If you want to do your eyes, use an eyeshadow, and maybe some mascara or eyeliner and a natural color lip with a little clear gloss. If you want to go for the lips, use your favorite lipstick and only use a little mascara on your eyes. (No tarantula legs.)

, Keep them short, and use a moisturizing lotion of your hands. People often judge you on the way your hands and nails are kept. Don't wear polish until it chips away, and don't over grow your nails. If you're going for fakes, go for the classic short French manicure look. Bold fake nails are outdated. Avoid buying the plastic kind and doing them yourself. Go to a salon. If you can't afford that, just keep your nails short and clean.
 Consider the color of your eyes, your skin tone, your body shape and your personal style when shopping.

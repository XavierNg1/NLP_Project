 In a relaxed state, your mind is more open to new ideas and directions.
 You want an environment that is comfortable and relaxing. Make sure it is a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed.
 Music is a great tool for relaxing your mind. Use music that helps you focus.


Only use music if it helps you meditate. Do not use music if it distracts you.
 Either sit crossed legged on the floor or in a chair with your legs uncrossed. Make sure that you are comfortable and well supported.


It’s best to keep both feet on the ground if you are sitting in a chair.
 If you do not want to keep your eyes open, find a room with enough light to come through your eyelids. While relaxed, you might fall asleep.
 While you sit comfortably, try to relax and let go of your thoughts. Breath deeply and regularly. Focus your attention on a point right below your navel. Once you are aware of this spot, only pay passive attention to it.
 If a thought comes to you, do not engage it. Acknowledge the thought and let it go. You want to avoid active participation. Any active participation might make you tense and distract you.
 Once you feel completely relaxed, repeat your autosuggestion to yourself. Put as much emotion as you can into the autosuggestion. Visualize yourself performing the autosuggestion.
 You want to give yourself enough time to focus on the autosuggestions so that you can absorb them.

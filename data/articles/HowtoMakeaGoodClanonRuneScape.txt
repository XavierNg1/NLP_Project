 No one would want to join if you're a low level.;
, Its important to be financially safe so make sure you have a surplus of money.
 For example say you want to have a mage only clan. Your requirements might be to have at least level 60 combat and at least level 94 mage or something like that. Of course only mages can join though. If you are going to pk (player kill) often then you might want to have a pking clan. You're the leader so you make all the rules, but the ranked people can do the same as you

, Don't tell them about the clan just ask to be friends. Then make sure whether they are trustworthy enough for them to join. Also remember to ask some of your friends to join. Once you get enough members start to think of a system such as specific jobs and positions. Decide who can do what. This will make the clan more organized. Try to make money at first. Remember the letters CMF.


C: Combat Level
M: Money
F: Friends
E: Expert on at least the free to play area of Runescape.
 You would want to start with money and then attract higher level friends.
 This will make it fun and better. Mix events up and throw in meetings once every week to talk about topics going on in the clan. Try these events: Pking, skill training, combat training, Pest Control, Barbarian Assault, Barrows, and much more. There's tons to do!

, Make up badges that are given to members, have clan wars, make allies and enemies, and pick out a specific god in the game. It makes the clan that much better.

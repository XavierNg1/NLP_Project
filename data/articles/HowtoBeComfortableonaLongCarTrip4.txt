Exhale as you come back to center and then repeat on the left side., Stretching out your ankles and wrists is especially important during a long car ride if you've been leaning on one hand or sitting with your feet in the same position for too long.Make sure you roll your wrists a few times in both backward and forward motions.
If you have space, place your ankle on top of the opposite knee to roll it. This will also help stretch out your hips. If you don't have the space, simply lift your foot a little off the floor and roll in both directions.

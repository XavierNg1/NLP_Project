 For this project, you will need window screening (you can find it at Lowe's or Home Depot), Scissors, Hot Glue, colorful Duct Tape, rope, and a hole punch.
 Wrap your duct tape around the two short ends., Hot glue the sides together. This is your "seam.", Fold the screening inside outside, so the "seams" are inside. It should look like a strapless bag., It should be at hand-level so you can easily put shells in it. Punch a hole (using the hole-punch) in the front side of the bag. Thread the rope through and tie a knot. Repeat on the other side.,

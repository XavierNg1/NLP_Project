 Every show's lottery policy is different, and some shows don't do a lottery at all. The following are general guidelines.
 Curtain time for the day's performance(s) should be easily found on the show's website. This is important because lottery entry and drawing times are typically given in relationship to curtain time.
 Ticket lotteries typically begin two to two-and-a-half hours prior to curtain. Drawings for the lottery can fall anywhere between one and two hours prior to curtain. You don't need to stand outside the theater for this whole period, but your tickets will be forfeited if you're absent when your name is called. You'll want to be able to stay within a few blocks of the theater from the time you enter until the drawing is over.
 Like rush tickets, some lottery tickets can be paid for with a credit card, but if the show's website doesn't specify, assume that you'll need cash.

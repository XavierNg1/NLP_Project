 To avoid injuries to both yourself and the cat, you should never handle them with your bare hands, even if you have been nurturing it for a while. Choose to use bait, such as cat food or white chicken meat to lure the cat into the trap., If you are planning to visit a veterinarian within 12 hours, you may keep the cat in the cage or trap during that time. Using this method will eliminate the need to release the cat and then have to re-trap it. If the veterinarian visit is planned for a time that is further in the future, designate a closed, warm space in your house and provide food and water for the time being. Suitable areas might be the basement or a quiet, unused room., At the size of a grain of rice, microchips sit just underneath the skin between the shoulder blades. Scanning a microchip provides contact information about the animal owner., Craigslist, weekly newspapers, or social media sites are great ways to reach out to the community. Add a picture of the cat, a specific description, and include the area where you found the cat., Many animal shelters are typically loaded with animals, and non-adopted ones are usually put to sleep after some time to avoid overpopulation. Many people will put up a re-homing fee; this is to help ensure the cat will be going to a safe and loving home., Taking stray cats off the street is a great alternative for pet adoption rather than using pet stores or shelters., Your home environment may have a lot of obstacles and conditions the cat either may adapt after several months or years, or not at all. Some obstacles that are typically more difficult to overcome are young children and existing pets, especially dogs. High levels of patience are required and it helps if you are able to provide a dedicated room for the cat the first few months., This helps the cat adjust to new territory and will likely pay off in the end by establishing a warm relationship.

 Lay out your 8 tortillas onto a cutting board and press down on the surface of the tortilla with a heart shaped cookie cutter.You can purchase heart shaped cookie cutters online or at most major department and craft stores.
Layer a couple of tortillas over each other to cut them faster.;
, Grease a standard 9 x 13 in (22.9 x 33 cm) cooking sheet with a cooking spray or olive oil so that your tortillas don't stick to the pan as they cook., Put the cheese in the center of the tortilla in a little pile. Try to get an even distribution of cheese on all the tortillas so that they taste similar., Line up 8 more of your tortilla hearts and place them over the existing tortillas with cheese on your cooking sheet. This will complete the preparation portion for your quesadillas., Preheat your oven and bring it up to 325°F (162.7°C). Place the cooking sheet on the middle rack and continue to cook them for three minutes. Once they are done cooking, take them out and allow them to cool. The cheese inside of the quesadilla should be completely melted., Allow your quesadillas to cool for a minute.Do not let your quesadillas sit for too long before serving, because the cheese will harden as it's out of the oven. Sprinkle salt over the top of your quesadillas to finish seasoning them and serve them.

 Most servers do not allow people to report griefing after a certain time.
 Another option is to watch your house, wait for the griefer, and either see their username, or take a screenshot of them griefing you.
 Post in the chat to warn others users of the danger.
 We all hate being griefed, it sucks right? So why not work on preventing it?;
, If you say leave a chest full of important stuff out in the open, the more like someone is to steal all of it, and to destroy your home.
 This one is pretty self explanatory.


Make sure friendly people know where these traps are though, no sense in slaughtering a friend.
 If they know there is good chance they will die, they are a lot less likely to try it.
 Above all though, know that from time to time someone is going to grief you, so have a secret backup supply stash ready, and move on. Make sure this secret stash is thousands of blocks away from spawn and use a x-ray proof design. It should get you back on your feet especially if there are no admins, mods, or owners around.
 There are plenty of anti-griefing Bukkit plugins out there ranging from region-protection to block logging. Check them out!

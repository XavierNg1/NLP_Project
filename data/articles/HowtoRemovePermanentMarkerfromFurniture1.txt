 The brand doesnâ€™t matter but avoid gel toothpastes or a combination as these don't tend to work as well.


This same process can work with baking soda in place of toothpaste. Or better yet, use toothpaste that contains baking soda!;
, Use enough toothpaste to ensure the stained area will be completely covered when the toothpaste is spread around. Don't be stingy., You don't need to soak the rag. Just run it under warm water then wring it out until it is just barely wet.
 As the toothpaste disappears, the permanent marker should as well.


If the marker doesn't completely disappear after the first attempt, repeat the process with a new damp cloth and another dab of toothpaste.
 Then wipe any remaining toothpaste from the surface until clear.

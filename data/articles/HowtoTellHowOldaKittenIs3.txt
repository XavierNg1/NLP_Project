 At around 4 months, kitten behavior begins changing as a result of changing hormones. Kittens of this age will meow loudly at night or try to escape the house to get outdoors.These can be signs that the kitten is beginning to go through puberty.
 A cat of this age will begin to lose its plumpness (baby fat) and develop a sleeker body, even as it gains weight.


Male kittens over 4 months may begin scent marking (spraying urine) to attract females to mate.
Female kittens may begin going into heat between 4 and 6 months. This also involves scent marking, along with loud yowling and writhing about.
 Kittens 7 months or older are considered juveniles, and they are both larger in size and sexually mature. Be aware that a juvenile female cat can become pregnant if she is not fixed. Along with sexual maturity comes increased aggression.


Kittens begin to challenge other cats for dominance starting at around 6 months.Juvenile kittens tend to bite more often than younger kittens or grown cats.
Cat bites tend to occur a lot from cats in the juvenile age group, so take care when handling cats from this age group.

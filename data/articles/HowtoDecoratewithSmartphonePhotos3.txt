 Take photos of subjects facing sunlight whenever possible so details aren’t obscured in the shade. If you know you want to use a photo of someone in particular as part of your decor, ask them to pose a little after sunrise or during sunset so you can bring out their features with the warm tones that the sun imparts at these times of day. Additionally, be on the lookout for eye-catching ways to use particular beams of sunlight, like photographing someone in the shaft of light coming in through a window., Keep in mind that subjects lit by various lights at various angles will create a hodgepodge of shadows. Expect these conflicting shadows to catch the viewer’s attention more so than the subject itself. Whenever possible, limit yourself to a single light source so shadows are cast consistently, which makes for a more dramatic effect., Your smartphone may or may not have a flash, but even if it does, avoid using it if possible. It may light things up, but expect the quality to be unattractively harsh. As an alternative, cover a pocket flashlight or the flashlight feature on a second phone with a thin white napkin. Illuminate the subject with a softer light for a less jarring photo., Avoid taking photos with only a single hand holding your phone, since this increases the chance of it altering position slightly and losing focus. For best results, hold your camera in two hands and support your arms or elbows on a stable surface. Also keep your feet and legs in mind and squat a little to stabilize your center of gravity so you don’t sway a little without realizing it., If you’re trying to capture a dynamic action rather than a static subject (such as someone in the act of skateboarding instead of just posing with their skateboard in hand), use your phone’s digital storage to maximum effect. Instead of waiting to capture the “perfect shot,” take as many photos as you can without pausing. Then review them afterward and pick which ones work best.

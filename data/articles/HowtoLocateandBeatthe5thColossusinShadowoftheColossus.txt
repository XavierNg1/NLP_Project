 When she’s beside you, mount her by pressing ∆.;
, The beams should centralize on the east side of the shrine.
 You'll notice there's a ravine and a small path beside it (near the place you entered through while going to the fourth colossus).
 Keep going forward, through the winding path, until you see another path between the mountains. Enter and walk through this path until you see some ruins.
,


Press R1 to dive underwater and go through it.
Go towards the wall and scale it by pressing ∆.
Press R1 to grab on the ledge.

,, This will cause Avion to fly up to the skies. Prepare for battle!, Avion will try to swoop down on you. You'll immediately notice that there's a patch of climbable fur on each side of its wings.
 Grab onto the fur.


This may sound easy, but the timing for it is horrendously hard to get, and you'll probably end up in the water more than half a dozen times, but keep going until you get the timing correctly.
Another thing that makes this hard is, if you miss the timing, there's a possibility that Avion will hit you and cause a lot of damage, so be cautious!

, It'll put up a fight and hysterically fly around. Once Avion settles, down run down its back and grab onto its tail.
 Be careful not to fall off while doing this, and watch your stamina.
 Grab its fur near the wings, and make your way through its right wing; the second weak point will be there.


Be extremely careful while transferring from the body to the wings as Avion will fly violently, leaving you only a small amount of time to get there.
 Do this only once! The weak point will immediately disappear, and stabbing it after the weak point disappears will cause Avion to go crazy.
 The last weak point will appear on the left wing. Repeat what you did to to the right wing.


Rest on Avion's back first before going straight to the left wing, just in case things go bad.
 Avion will fall down and die.

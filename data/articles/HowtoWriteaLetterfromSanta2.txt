 The Post Office has a longstanding “letters to Santa” program for children.


First, have the child write a letter to Santa. Have the child address it to Santa Claus, North Pole. When the child isn’t looking, write Santa’s response on the back of the letter. Then, send the letter to the following address: North Pole Holiday Postmark, Postmaster, 4141 Postmark Dr, Anchorage, AK, 99530-9998.
Be specific in the letter. Reference your child’s accomplishments, such as how proud Santa is that the child helped at something specific. Sign it, Santa Claus. Put the letter in a new envelope addressed to the child. Put a first-class stamp on it. The return address on the envelope should say Santa Claus, North Pole.
 If the Anchorage postmaster receives the letter by Dec. 15, the postmaster will remove Santa’s letter addressed to your child, apply the North Pole postmark, and send it back to your child.


The child will then receive the letter from Santa in the mail.It's more believable to a child when a letter arrives in the mail. Just make sure it's not in your handwriting if the child might recognize it.

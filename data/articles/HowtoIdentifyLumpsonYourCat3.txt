 Check for lumps on your cat every month, and whenever their behavior changes. If a lump turns out to be a tumor, the sooner it is addressed, the better. Start by placing both of your hands on top of your cat’s head and petting them around their ears and beneath their neck. Then check their front legs, beneath the shoulders, and down their back and belly. Finally, feel their hips and back legs.Call your vet or set up an appointment to have any new lumps inspected.
 Tumors that are benign, meaning that they are not cancerous, will generally grow very slowly. You may notice one when it is still small, and may never even notice a change in size. Lumps from benign tumors will be rounded and firm. You may be able to move them around beneath the skin. The skin itself will not appear unhealthy.Benign tumors are generally not a risk to your cat, but it’s worth having a vet check it out.
Your vet will likely recommend removal of a tumor on a cat’s face or legs, even if it’s benign. Otherwise, they will likely recommend leaving a benign tumor alone.
 Malignant, cancerous tumors pose a risk to your cat and should be addressed immediately. Fortunately, they are also relatively easy to identify. Foremost, malignant tumors will seemingly appear suddenly, be surprisingly large, and will grow noticeably quickly. They may be an odd shape, and the skin above them may appear discolored or otherwise unhealthy.The cause of malignant tumors in cats is unknown, though they sometimes develop near the location where a cat received a vaccine or other injection.

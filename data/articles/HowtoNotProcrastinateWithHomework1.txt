 We are all plugged into the matrix today, whether it be Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or another way to connect. Regardless of the form of social media or game, turn off updates. If you can't resist temptation, there are software tools and router settings to limit internet usage., Email automatically delivered to you based on receipt or software timeline is pushed, because it's sent without your interaction. When you must look or check for new email, it's called pulling email. Every email client has a setting to stop automatic email push and notification. Remove the distraction by seeing emails only when you deem necessary., The allure of TV and radio is stronger than homework. Hearing the opening jingle of your favorite TV show, or a great quote from an intense movie, can lead to complete distraction. It's even possible the TV and radio are subliminally distracting you. , Isolate yourself completely from sound and distraction. Noise-cancelling headphones are perfect for 100% focus on the task at hand. Choose one you believe will help you really focus., Try to make it as much like a library as possible. Bright lights will help avoid sleepiness, which can hinder motivation. Working at a desk instead of your recliner, sofa, or bed will help you stay on task. Keep only homework related items near you. Clear off the desk or your work area so the only possible temptation is homework completion.

 You’ll find the “Insert” menu at the top of the screen.


Mac users will see a menu of shapes appear on the right side of the screen.
PC users will see a drop down menu of shapes.
 Click on a 2D object that you’d like to convert to three dimensions. Click on your document and your shape will appear.
 Right click (for Mac users, Ctrl + click) the shape and select “Format Shape”.
 Select “3-D Rotation” and use the rotation buttons to turn your shape along the X, Y, and Z axes. Play with the rotation until your shape is facing the desired direction.


You need to rotate the shape along the X or Y axis to see the depth you are about to add.
 Still in your “Format Shape” menu, select 3-D Format > Depth and Surface. Increase the “Depth” value to your desired depth and watch your 2D shape become 3D.


You can experiment with the depth amount and the X, Y, and Z angles until you are satisfied with the look of your 3D object.
The 3-D Format > Bevel menu allows you to add more 3D effects to the top and bottom of your object.

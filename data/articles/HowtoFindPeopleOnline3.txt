 Type the person's name in the search field. If you know a city or state, add that as well.



You’re more likely to find people if their names are on a website for the company they work for, if they blog regularly or have articles published online, or if their names are in the news.
It’s easier to find someone this way if his or her name is uncommon. It’s also easier if you have a full first name and a middle name. If you are searching for a woman who might be married, try using both her maiden and married names.

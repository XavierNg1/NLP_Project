 Diamond is the major distributor, and it will be almost impossible to run a comic shop without working with them, as they have exclusive relationships with most of the major publishers. Diamond recently raised their monthly pre-ordering minimum of $425 (prior to any wholesale discounts), so make sure you can afford to do business with them each month.;
, For example, Haven Distributors specializes in indie comics and has a low minimum order to qualify for wholesale prices.
 You may need to wait up to two weeks after applying to be able to order through their system. Once accepted, you will be assigned a customer account number.
 When dealing with Diamond, you can order via the Previews order form, the Diamond website, or the Previews Program for Windows.
 Wednesday is new comics day, so be prepared for an increase in traffic to your store each Wednesday.

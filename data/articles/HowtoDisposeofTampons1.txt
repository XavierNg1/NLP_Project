 Once you have removed your tampon, you should dispose of it properly. This means never letting the tampon simply fall into the toilet and then flushing the tampon down the drain. This will clog the drain of the toilet and could damage the plumbing., You should take a piece of toilet paper and wrap it around the tampon. This will prevent blood from dripping everywhere and protect your hands from touching the blood on the tampon.Wrapping the tampon in toilet paper will also make it appear more discreet and hidden. You may do this to try to cover up the tampon.
 Make sure you dispose of the tampon in the garbage. Throwing it away as soon as you take it out will contain the mess and allow you to get rid of the tampon discreetly.


Sometimes tampons can start to smell if they are left out for a few days so you may start a separate garbage for your tampons next to the garbage or in the bathroom cupboard. Make sure you dispose of it after one to two days.

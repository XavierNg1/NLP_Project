 Numb or tingling lips could be related to an allergic reaction, especially when accompanied by itching, swelling, or an upset stomach. Try taking an over the counter allergy medication to manage numb or tingling lips and any accompanying symptoms.Note the food and drinks you consumed prior to the onset of your symptoms. Try to identify and eliminate the possible allergen from your diet. If you used a lip balm or similar product before experiencing numbness, stop using it.
In severe food allergies, numbness and tingling can precede anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening allergic response that requires immediate medical care.;
, If swelling accompanies your numbness, apply an ice pack to the affected area for 10 to 15 minutes. Swelling and numbness could result from an insect bite, a bump or other minor trauma, or allergies.Swelling could put too much pressure on facial nerves, which can cause numbness.
You can also take an anti-inflammatory medication to help decrease swelling.
 If no swelling is present, avoid using a cold compress. The issue could be related to a lack of blood flow to your lips, and applying a warm compress can help increase blood flow.Decreased blood flow could be a simple reaction to cold temperatures, or could indicate an underlying issue, such as Raynaudâ€™s disease.
 In addition to applying a warm compress, you could try massaging your lips to warm them and increase blood flow. Try moving your mouth and lips around and exhaling air between your lips to vibrate them.Wash your hands before and after massaging your lips.
 Numbness and tingling can occur just before a cold sore develops. If you suspect lip numbness might be due to a cold sore, apply an over the counter medicated ointment or talk to your doctor about a prescription antiviral pill.You could also try holding a slice of garlic over a cold sore for 10 to 15 minutes.

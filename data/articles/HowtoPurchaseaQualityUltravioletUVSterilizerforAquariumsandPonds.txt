 -- Low-pressure lamps are much better in aquatic uv sterilizers and clarifiers. Low-pressure lamps produce virtually all of their UV output at a wavelength of 254 nanometers, which is very close to the peak germicidal wavelength of 264 nanometers. Low-pressure lamps typically run on low-input power (saving you money on the electric bill) and operate at temperatures between 100º and 200º Fahrenheit. They have a useful life of 8,000 to 12,000 hours, depending on the operating current of the lamp. Low-pressure lamps are also better for uv water sterilizers because they are long and therefore have more ARC length. As a general rule, the longer the lamp, the greater amount of UV light the water will receive because it will be exposed to the UV source for a longer period of time.;
, -- The design of the UV sterilizer's water exposure chamber (body) is the primary design criteria that will determine the unit's "UV dose rate" at any given water flow rate. Select a unit with the right diameter body compared to the wattage you are considering. A unit with a larger diameter will have a greater contact time, but if the body is too large the water furthest from the lamp could receive diminished uv intensity. If the body is too small you could be wasting valuable uv light and, in turn, money on the electric bill, again. For example, 25-watt standard-output T5 low-pressure lamp has an ideal diameter body of 3 inches (7.6 cm), while an 80-watt high-output T6 low-pressure lamp has an ideal diameter body of 5 inches (12.7 cm). This has been proven via scientific tests by independent companies like Bolton Photosciences, Inc. and the EPA.
 -- Any portion of the UV lamp that is not located between the water ports is rendered useless by fluid dynamics. Wasted UV-C light will reduce the efficiency of the uv sterilizer and/or clarifier. And for a third time, will affect your cost efficiency as well.
 -- The quartz sleeve is needed to isolate the UV lamp from the water to avoid possible shock and damage from the lamp's electrical components getting wet. The quartz sleeve is also important because it allows the uv lamp to operate at its optimum temperature through insulation.
 -- The end-of-lamp-life rating takes into account the lamp losing UV-C output due to age and therefore is a more realistic projection of how the unit will perform over time. This also slows the water flow rate down to ensure your aquarium or pond water is getting enough uv exposure to eliminate your harmful bacteria and algae microorganisms.
 -- The power supply should be positioned remotely on the cord and away from the uv sterilizer body and the aquatic application. The power supply needs to be as dry as possible to avoid damage to the unit and the chance of electric shock situations.

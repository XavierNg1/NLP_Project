 This vinyl doesn't change the appearance of the fabric, and is great for waterproofing baby bibs and lunch bags., Once you have waterproofed the fabric, you can use it as a tablecloth, or even cut it up and sew it into a lunch bag., If the fabric you are working with is dirty, then wash it, and let it dry completely.









If the fabric cannot be washed, then use a vacuum or a brush. You can also use a specially-formulated fabric cleaner if the fabric is heavily soiled.
 This will make the fabric easier to work with. Any ripples or folds will end up as wrinkles in the finished piece. If necessary, iron the fabric out to get it as smooth as possible., If the vinyl is too narrow for your fabric, then you will need to cut the vinyl to the length of your fabric. You will need to cut several pieces like this, and overlap them later on., You will notice that the paper has two sides: a shiny side and a dull side. You will also notice that the vinyl has two sides as well: a sticky side and a smooth side., If the vinyl is not wide enough, lay two sheets of vinyl next to each other. Overlap the edges by Â¼ inch (0.64 centimeter)., Make sure that the shiny side of the paper is facing down, and that the paper is covering the vinyl entirely. You will be ironing the vinyl, and the paper will help protect it from getting melted., Turn on your iron and set it to medium heat. Do not use a high heat setting, or you will melt the vinyl. Carefully run the iron over the paper. Do not leave it in one spot for too long, and do not use any steam., The heat of the iron will have melted the glue on the vinyl, and fused it to the fabric.

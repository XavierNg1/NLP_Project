 Empty an entire 750 ml bottle of Everclear, an entire 750 ml bottle of coconut rum, and half of a 750 ml bottle of vodka into a large container, such as a 5 gallon ((19 l) cooler. Mix the alcohols together with a long-handled spoon., Once the alcohols are combined, add 16 ounces (473 ml) of pineapple juice and 1 gallon (3.8 l) of fruit punch. Next, mix some orange and pineapple slices, and give the entire mixture a good stir to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully blended.You can substitute any juice that you like for the pineapple juice. Orange, grapefruit, and cranberry all work well.
You can mix whatever type of sliced fruit you like into the punch. For the best flavor, match the slices to the juice, though.
 When all of the ingredients are combined, fill your glasses with ice. Use a ladle to pour the punch over the ice, and serve to your guests.If you find that the punch is too strong, you can mix in a fruity soda, such as lemon lime, to dilute it.

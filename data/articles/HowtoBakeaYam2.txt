 Sweet potatoes can be cooked at any temperature from 375-450Â°.
 Take 4 yams, peel, and then cut into one-inch cubes. Spread the medallions out into a roasting tray.


An alternate way to cut the yams is to wash and leave the peel on the yams. Slice the yams into medallions, as narrow or wide as desired.Eating the peel provides extra nutrients and aids in digestion.Just make sure to wash extremely well if you are going to eat the peeling.
 First, drizzle oil over the potatoes.If you do not want to cover the yams in oil, brush them with butter instead.Decide if you would like a sweeter dish or a savory dish, or a mixture of both.


For a sweeter dish, drizzle the yam chunks with honey, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Alternately, add brown or white sugar.
For a savory dish, sprinkle salt, pepper, and paprika over the yams.
 Place into the oven. Cook until tender, or the yams start to crinkle around the edges. Start testing the potatoes when they've been cooking for fifteen minutes.

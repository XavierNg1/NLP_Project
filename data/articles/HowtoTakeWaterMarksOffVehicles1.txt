 Using an equal amount of each or 2 parts water to 1 part vinegar, fill a tub with enough water to wash your windows. If your watermarks are particularly bad, you will want to do the stronger of the two vinegar solutions.Some water spots may appear to have disappeared, but return after you dry your windows. If this is the case, bump up your vinegar solution to half water and half vinegar or even straight vinegar.;
, Microfiber cloths are wonderful for cleaning windows, as they do not leave any fibers behind. When you are cleaning watermarks, it is extremely important to leave as little residue as possible., Soak your cloth completely in your vinegar solution and immediately place it on your windows, washing in a circular motion. You may need to pay special attention to any areas with a lot of staining or thick, calcified deposits.
 Once you have finished washing your windows, immediately dry them with a clean, microfiber rag. If you notice any lingering spots, go over the area again, putting a little bit more elbow grease into your movements.

Do not worry about rinsing your windows before drying, as vinegar can be wiped directly from the glass.
Skipping this step could result in further water calcification. Always thoroughly dry your windows after washing.

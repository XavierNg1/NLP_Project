 Fill a bowl with warm water and add a drop or two of mild dish soap.








Alternatively, you can wipe a soft, damp cloth on a bar of mild soap.;
, Then thoroughly wring out the cloth.









It is very important to make sure the cloth is only damp, not wet. Otherwise water can seep down between the keys and cause damage to the piano body.Make sure you use a white cloth. A colored cloth can transfer dye to your keys and discolor them.
 Brush down the keys back to front. Do not wipe side to side, as this can transfer moisture and dirt between the keys. Do not wipe backwards either, since this pushes dirt behind the keys.
 This is important because if you use the same cloth and then wipe the white keys, black paint can stain your white keys. Use the same front to back motion that you used on the white keys.
 Again, make sure you wipe back to front to avoid getting anything between the keys.
 Wiping the keys down will remove dust and dirt, but fingerprints require different treatment.








Mix up a solution of 1 part vinegar and 4 parts water.
Dip a soft, white cloth into the solution. Wring it out to make sure it's only damp before wiping the keys down.
Wipe and dry each key individually. Make sure the previous key is dry before moving on to the next- the vinegar could damage the keys if it's on too long.
If your piano has a cover for the keys, leave it up for a day to let the vinegar smell dissipate.
 Be sure to lower the cover when you're done playing your piano. This way, you'll avoid dust buildup and won't have to do this cleaning procedure very often.

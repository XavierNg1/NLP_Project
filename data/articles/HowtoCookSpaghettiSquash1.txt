 Slice the squash in half and place it on a baking sheet, flesh side down.,, Bake it until it's tender. After 35 minutes, start poking it with a fork to check to see how tender it is. Then, remove the squash from the oven.
 Rake the squash with a fork, creating the spaghetti-like strands.
 Spoon 4 oz. of mozzarella cheese, 1 jar of spaghetti sauce, and 2 tsp of dry basil over the spaghetti squash.
 This should take another 2-4 minutes.
 Enjoy this spaghetti squash while it's hot.

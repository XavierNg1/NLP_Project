 If you have a smartphone, tablet, or other device for yourself, this is the best choice. However, if you don't have your own personal device, then you will need to use your parents' phone or computer.;
, It doesn't matter if you are using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc., just log in your account. Log out afterward, and don't let it remember your password. Your parents will know you have an account when they visit the page, especially if it's their device.
 If you are using your parents' phone, your parents will know you're using social media sites if the notifications show up. If you are using your own phone, even if your parents don't check your phone, they may be suspicious if you receive too many notifications.
 Particularly paranoid parents may check your browsing history to find out what websites you were on. You should delete your history after you use the website. Don't delete all of it, just the websites you aren't allowed to be on.

 When your boyfriend does things that are exactly what you like, make sure to let him know. Encourage the behavior by responding well or openly telling him that you appreciated his behavior.Try saying something like, “I love it when you do that.” It will demonstrate that what he did was positive and you’d like him to do it more often.
If he holds your hand or does something else that you wish he’d do more, respond with positive body language. Smile and hug him closer so he knows you appreciate the gesture.
 Being direct and explaining what’s going on is often the shortest route to a solution. You may want to address your boyfriend directly and explain to him that you’re unhappy and would like him to alter his behavior.Being assertive and being aggressive are different things. Don’t approach the situation out of anger, but rather in hopes of improving things between the two of you.
If you want your boyfriend to hold your hand while you walk down the hallway at school, don’t wait for him to take your hand. Instead, take his.
 Remember that relationships are two way streets and you shouldn’t expect your boyfriend to behave in an outwardly loving manner if you don’t do so yourself. Make sure that you demonstrate your feelings for him in a way that makes him know how you feel.It wouldn’t be fair for you to expect behavior from your boyfriend that you’re unwilling to do yourself.
Showing your love may make your boyfriend more comfortable expressing his own. It may be difficult for some people to open up about their feelings, but by making him feel comfortable and loved, it may be easier for him.

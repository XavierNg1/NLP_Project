 This depends on the subject for magazines. If you want to keep up with politics, do subscribe to a magazine about politics. Or if you want to know the latest about games, subscribe to one of the gaming magazines. As for newspapers, find one you like. You can purchase a copy of a newspaper to see what it's like before subscribing. The same applies to magazines.
 This can be extremely useful, especially since your favourite news channel has an RSS feed meaning you can keep up to date on important events. Google Reader is also useful for things like blog posts or web comic updates.
 Read a lot of books and watch a lot of movies. The former is preferred to the latter, but if the books or movies are good, then both are good. Quotes and references are most often from classic books and movies, so make sure you read them.
 Facebook allows you to connect with your friends and family as well as receive updates. Twitter allows you to "follow" your favourite celebrities and/or political figures as well as your family and friends.

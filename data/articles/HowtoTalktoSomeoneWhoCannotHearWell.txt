 Don't mumble. If you talk fast, even someone with good hearing can have trouble. Slow down, especially if you do not enunciate well.;
, Sound is directional, and needs to be toward the person. Anything in the mouth is going to reduce clarity and enunciation.
 Some Deaf and hard of hearing people use lip reading to understand what you are saying, so if you're looking away, they'll have no idea what you're saying.
 Would it help if you talked more slowly, or more loudly? Different people have different needs, so instead of assuming, just ask how you can help.


There's no need to start shouting or using a high-pitched tone of voice like you would to a small child. This can come across as patronizing. If they need you to make an adjustment, they will tell you.
 You may need to repeat yourself sometimes or make other adjustments to accommodate them. Remember, being Deaf presents many more challenges to them than it does to you, and they certainly aren't trying to annoy you!

, Your conversation partner most likely has many interesting things to say, and may come from a culture very different from your own. They have valuable things to tell you. Make sure they have the opportunity to speak too.
 Background noise, loud music, many people talking, traffic noise, dishwater running, et cetera can make it more difficult for them to hear you.
 They know themselves well and have plenty of experience dealing with their disability. They are experts on their own needs. If you are ever wondering how to accommodate them, just ask.

 Also known as a website domain, an Internet web address provides some protection against future entrepreneurs who want to use your name for their website.


Call your Internet service provider to acquire an Internet web address for your business.
Consider purchasing additional Internet web address extensions in addition to ".com," such as ".net," ".biz" and ".info." This protects against domain name confusion if another party attempts to use your name on the Internet.
 If your business has customers in other parts of the country and the world, a federal trademark is critical to ensure another business doesn't take the same name Doing so can cause customer confusion when doing business over the Internet.


Check your national trademark registration authority to search for names similar to yours. If another party hasn't used your business name, you can file an application.
Look for another name if your business name is already taken.
Consider filing the trademark application yourself (if your business name is available). Obtain self-help books to learn how to file the correct paperwork.
Hire a lawyer who specializes in trademark applications if the trademark application is too cumbersome for you.
 This lets businesses know you have legal claims to your name.


Type "TM" (trademark) in super-script type wherever your business name appears in your website and print communications, before your application is accepted.
Replace the "TM" with a capital R surrounded by a circle once your trademark application is approved. This symbol indicates the name is registered. On a Macintosh computer, the symbol is typed with the "Option" plus "R" keys, while on a Windows-based computer you can use the "ALT" key plus the numerals 0174.

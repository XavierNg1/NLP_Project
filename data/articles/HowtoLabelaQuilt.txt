 Write your name in a corner with neat writing. This option is the least pretty and you risk the ink running or your writing not looking neat enough.;
, Embroidering your name on is in keeping with the stitchery feel of the project and will last as long as the quilt. Use an embroidery stitch that you're good at and that will stand out from the rest of the quilt. Again, choose a corner or some other inconspicuous place.
 If you want to make a label, this can be sewn directly to the quilt. The advantage of a label is that it can be written on without marring the quilt. It can also be large enough to include your address or a phone number as well as your name if wished. The label could be in matching fabric, or use calico or other similar easy-to-sew fabric with an old world feel.
 This can be a pretty option albeit a fiddly one.

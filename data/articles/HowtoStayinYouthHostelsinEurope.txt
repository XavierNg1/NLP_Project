 There are some basic guiding rules that impact your choice of a youth hostel. First the location â€“ the nearer it is to the top places that you want to visit, the better. If you want to book online, spend a little time reading a few of the comments about the hotel you're looking at. On many websites you can find user reviews on hotels before booking online.;
, Understand that you're not going to a 5 star resort, so the bathroom will probably be shared. Some hostels have separate bathrooms but many do not. Maintain your personal hygiene and avoid sharing toothbrushes, toothpaste, water glasses and towels. Also, if you want to take a shower, always wear flip flops, as you don't want to turn your feet into a fungus farm, or share your fungus with others.
 Perhaps you'll be sharing the bedroom with many people, some of them probably unknown to you, so you'll surely want to keep your personal objects out of other people's hands. If you have some valuable objects, ask at the hotel if there is a safe box where you can leave them. If not, try bringing a little box with a lock and hide it somewhere. If you have to carry a lot of money with you, use an old trick: put the money in a 3/4 panty (yes, the one your girlfriend uses) and put it inside your jeans or pants, then tie it up to the front button and there you go!

, It's not your room, so be tidy. You and your fellow travelers will benefit from this and you will avoid losing something on the way. The same goes for the kitchen and living spaces; clean up after yourself, just as you'd expect others to do.
 You're living with many other people from many parts of the world, so take care of your manners to make living together as pleasant as possible. If you're respectful, you'll see that you'll gain new friends and have a wonderful time!

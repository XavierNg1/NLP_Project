 In addition to causing an enzyme deficiency, EPI can lead to a deficiency of vitamin B12 (also known as cobalamin). This deficiency occurs when there is a bacterial overgrowth in the gut. These bacteria 'steal' the nutrients, leading to nutrient deficiencies. To correct this deficiency, your vet would first give your German Shepherd weekly vitamin B12 injections into the muscle, then give the injections every 3 months.Your vet will periodically take a blood sample to measure the amount of vitamin B12 in your German Shepherd’s blood.It is not known whether a vitamin B12 deficiency significantly affects in dogs with EPI.Your vet will determine whether vitamin B12 supplementation is necessary for your German Shepherd.
 If your German Shepherd's gut cannot properly absorb nutrients due to bacterial overgrowth, diarrhea will occur. If your German Shepherd continues to have diarrhea with pancreatic enzyme supplementation, the bacteria are probably the culprit. Your vet will prescribe an antibiotic to correct the overgrowth.Your German Shepherd may be on the antibiotic for up to 6 weeks., Since EPI decreases the ability of dog’s gut to absorb nutrients, a low-fat, highly digestible diet used to be recommended for dogs with this condition. However, a low-fat diet would make it even harder for your German Shepherd’s gut to absorb fat. This could cause deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, E, and K) and essential fatty acids (omega 3 and omega 6).A low-fiber diet may help your German Shepherd, especially if it’s not gaining weight.Most dogs with EPI do not need a dietary change.Talk with your vet before making any changes to your German Shepherd’s diet.

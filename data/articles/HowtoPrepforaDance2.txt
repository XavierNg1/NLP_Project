 When you wake up in the morning rub them just under your eyes. This gets rid of bags without surgery.
 If you can, sleep with your feet flat up against something, like the footboard on your bed. Try to stretch yourself out while still being comfortable enough to stay like that all night.
 This keeps your lips smooth and soft all day and night.

 When most people hear "organic," they automatically think of organic food. Organic goods can include a range of products, though, including food, health and beauty products, cleaning products, gardening products, and even clothing. Determine what, exactly, you want your store to provide. An organic grocery store will likely focus on food and beauty products, while a general purpose organic store might have a little of everything.
 Organic goods tend to be more expensive than non-organic goods. As such, you may find that stocking your shelves the first time around is a more difficult or more costly process than you realized.
 Check out directories of organic wholesalers or contact organizations that specialize in the promotion of organic stores.Research the suppliers and double-check their reputations.
 If you are satisfied with a supplier and that supplier is equally satisfied with you, you may be able to secure a long-term contract. The benefit of a long-term contract is that you can lock in a particular price for the goods you obtain from that supplier. This can be especially important for you as the owner of an organic store since organic food prices are known to fluctuate., There are nationally set organic standards. In order to qualify as an organic business, your products must meet these standards. Become familiar with these rules and consider having your shop officially certified as organic by the Organic Trade Association.

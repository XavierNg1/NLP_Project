 You'll need to wash and slice one apple. Since you'll end up simmering the apple, you won't need to core it or remove the seeds. Place the sliced apple in a saucepan. Peel one orange and add the peel to the saucepan as well.Eat the orange or save it for another use.
You can also leave the peel on the apple.
 Add 1 tablespoon of whole cloves and 3 cinnamon sticks to the saucepan that has the apple slices and orange peel. This is your fresh fall potpourri.Because the fruit hasn't been dried, you'll need to use this potpourri immediately.
 Add 3 cups of water (705 ml) to the fall potpourri in your saucepan. Turn the heat on to low and let the potpourri come to a slight bubble. Continue simmering the potpourri until your house smells like fall.You can turn off the potpourri once your home is fragranced. You can also add more water to the saucepan to keep simmering the potpourri.

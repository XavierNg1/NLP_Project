 Before you just go ahead and create a channel and start posting videos, think and act. Choose a suitable name for your channel and a unique one. Think of what videos you'll be posting. It should be something you love to do, not something you don't like or don't know much about.;
, Don't expect to get 1000 subscribers in just a day or a week. Growing a YouTube channel is a very tough and slow process. Sometimes it can even take years to fetch you a decent amount of viewers (depending on how good you are).
 Make sure you are being yourself. No matter what videos you upload, it has to be you. Don't let your videos be dry and dull. Post interactive videos where you can talk to your audience and they can talk to you back. Think of it as a community. Post your own original ideas and not copies, because if you post copies your audience might have already seen them and your channel will be no use to them. Think fresh and original, and at a few places...try to be funny.
 It's the internet so there is a 55% chance of haters trying to bring your hopes down. If you think you are good...then you are! Don't listen to people who try to bring down your channel. The best thing to do is just ignore.
 Don't just go ahead and post dull videos. Post videos which at least have a good quality (360-780 is good enough). Quality also refers to how bright your videos are. Never let them be dull and have no meaning. Post videos which will keep your viewers interested and to come back and eventually...Subscribe!

, Tell friends and family about your channel. Don't feel shy. Just put yourself out there. Chances are they can spread the news.

 Adjust the end pin length. Test this by playing G on the E-string - your finger should be level with your eyes.

(like squeezing a ball between fingertip and thumb), You can use a tuning fork or an electric tuner, or use tuning harmonics (explained elsewhere). The lowest (thickest) string is E, then A, D, and G., Classical music primarily uses the bow, while jazz, bluegrass, and other contemporary styles use pizzicato primarily. To pluck the bass properly, align your index finger pointing downward, pulling the string away with as much of your finger (from tip to middle knuckle) as possible. Proper bowing technique starts with a proper grip for your style of bow, and a relaxed body and hand. Keep the bow perpendicular to the strings, halfway between the bridge and fingerboard. The feeling should be of pulling the sound from the string rather than pressing down on the string, although significant pressure is required for clear sound., If you lay the rest of your fingers down, you naturally rest in first position. That is F# on your first finger, G on your second (middle) finger, and G# under your pinky. Work with these intervals until you get them in tune.,, Half position begins a half step lower in tone than First position on all strings.,

 If you find that you have unintentionally run out of Effexor, call your pharmacy and inquire as to whether you have any refills left. If you do, all you may need to do is go over and pick up your new pills.
 If you have no refills, contact your doctor or psychiatrist immediately and let them know that you need a new prescription. Make an appointment for as soon as possible.
 If you are unable to get an appointment with your doctor any sooner than 72 hours, it is advisable to go to the nearest emergency room. This may sound unnecessary, but Effexor's withdrawal symptoms can present as soon as 24 hours after a missed dose., Once in triage, tell the nurse about your condition (what you are being treated for with Effexor), how long it has been since your last dose, and what dosage you are on. Some nurses are unaware of how serious Effexor withdrawals can be, so be patient and explain to them that missed doses of this medication can cause you to become very ill., Inform the doctor of when your next appointment with your doctor/psychiatrist is, and they may be able to write you a prescription for a small quantity that will hold you over until you can see your doctor., When you leave the emergency room, go straight to the pharmacy and fill the prescription. This way, you will not lose the prescription or forget to fill it.

 Stand next to the pole so that it's closer to your weaker side. Then, place both of your hands on the pole so you're gripping it like a baseball bat, with your hands a bit more than a foot apart. The hand closest to the pole should be on top and the hand on your outside should be on the bottom. Your lower hand should be at about eye level.
 Take one step with the foot closer to the pole and swing the leg on the outside around the pole to get your momentum going. This will give you enough speed and power to comfortably swing around the pole.
 Pull up on the pole with your hands so your arms are supporting the entire weight of your body for a second. As you do this, jump off on your inside foot and grab onto the pole with both of your knees. Make sure you have a firm grip on the pole so you don't slide off.
 Continue to hold onto the pole with your hands and knees as you spin down around the pole until you land on both feet. The higher your arms are positioned on the pole originally, the longer you'll spin before you reach the ground.
 Once you've landed, just move your hips back and get back into a standing position.

 Your relationship may not be fully developed if you are in the early stages, but you should be able to determine whether it is on the road to being a healthy relationship. A healthy relationship is built on love, trust, and communication. A few signs of a healthy relationship are when both partners in the relationship are able to:Share feelings and thoughts openly
Feel secure and happy in themselves
Admit when they are wrong
Share what they admire about their partner
Spend time on a variety of activities: intimacy, play, serious conversation, sharing new experiences, etc.
 You might specifically want to ask about his views on equal partnership. Some abusive men have very strong feelings about “traditional” gender roles in a relationship.Remember, however, that some people talk a good game, but do not follow through with their actions.


Abusive men will often think of women as inferior to men.If a potential partner expresses ideas that men are superior to women, he is unlikely to be a good match, even if he doesn’t turn out to be abusive. You should be with someone who respects you.
 An early warning sign of an abusive or controlling relationship is a man trying to keep you from other people.If he seems to be limiting the time you spend with friends or family, get out now. This is a trend that continues and escalates in an abusive relationship until the victim is so isolated that she feels as though she has nowhere to go if she wishes to leave., Even when they are having problems, members of a committed, healthy relationship speak well of each other to others.If your partner talks down about you, insults you, or blames you for problems while you are not around, he may be heading down the road towards abuse. While it can be difficult to know how someone speaks about you while you’re not there, if you feel uneasy about it, you can always ask other people.

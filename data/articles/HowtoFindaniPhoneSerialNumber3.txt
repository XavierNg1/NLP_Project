 Flip your device over and check the lower portion of its back side. Right below the word “iPhone” you’ll find a set of alphanumeric combinations. One of these sets is labeled “S/N” or “Serial,” which refers to the serial number of your device.
 If you still have the box that came with your iPhone, look around its sides and find its barcode. Listed with the barcode are two sets of numerical combination: one is its IMEI, the other is labeled “S/N” or “Serial,” which refers to the serial number of your device.

 Lord Shiva is often referred as " MAHADEV ", meaning God of Gods.


God refers to: G - Generator (Lord Brahma, the creator); O - Operator (Lord Vishnu) and D - destroyer (Lord Shiva destroys with his third eye). In this regards, it may seem that Lord Shiva has the third eye and he destroys in anger. But the truth is mahadev is bhole shankar ('bhola' means innocent), he is the only God who is pleased by mere chanting of his name and fulfills all wishes of all people. 
The other popular names associated with Lord Shiva are Mahesh, Maheshwar, Shankar, Shambhu, Rudra, Har, Trilochan, Devendra (meaning Chief of the gods) and Triloknath (meaning Lord of the three realms).
Shiva means "the One who is eternally pure" and he is untouched by any thing. ;

 Shelves can help organize any room by allowing you stack your possessions vertically. In a small room, wall-mounted shelves that hang are often the best choice.


Mounted shelves allow you to store items against the wall without taking up floor space.
You can also mount shelves above your bed, allowing you to store items both above and underneath.
 When possible, use furniture that doubles as storage. For example, instead of a bedside table, use a cabinet or trunks that can double as storage.Trunks can be attractive nightstands. You can use them to store winter blankets that you only need to access once a year when the weather starts to get cold., If you use baskets or tubs to store your belongings, use attractive containers that stack on top of each other.


These container get your things off the floor and hide clutter

, Windows create storage problems. You can't hang shelves or place large furniture items in front of them. A window box provides storage space as well as seating.


Get a large wooden box with a lid. It should be slightly shorter than the bottom edge of your windowsill. Fill it up with your possessions. Then, close the lid and cover it with some large pillows. Now, you have a place to sit and enjoy the sunshine, and you can store things there.

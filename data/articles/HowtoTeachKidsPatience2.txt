 Children won’t just sit there and wait for something to happen. Instead, they need to learn how to engage themselves in other ways while they wait. They may distract themselves by playing, singing a song, or dancing in a mirror.You can help reinforce this habit by saying to your child, “We have to wait to do that. Why don’t you sing this song or play with your toys for now?”

, You can also teach patience through hands on activities. By having your small child go through the process of creating something before they get the end result, you can help teach them patience and how to wait for the results.For example, try buying toys that you and your child can put together, like Legos or model cars. Not being able to play with the toy until they have put it together can help teach patience.
Baking is another way to make patience into an activity. Bake a cake with your child and let them help measure and mix ingredients.
Fishing can help you bond with your child while teaching them how to wait for the fish to bite.
 You can teach toddlers how to be patient by playing games with them. It’s hard for toddlers to be patient because of their age, so games can help distract them and teach them how to deal with waiting.Play physical games with them, like having them march in place, sway like a tree in the wind, or play patty cake.
Play knowledge games by giving them categories and having them give examples from that category.
 Some parents just give their children tablets or video games to keep them distracted. This doesn’t teach children how to entertain themselves without technology or learn how to focus. Instead, it reduces patience and decreases their attention span. Teaching patience without technology can help a child learn skills to cope with waiting in life.

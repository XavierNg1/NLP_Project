 When you know where your presentation will take place, you can envision yourself giving your speech. Check out the room where you’re be presenting. Get a feel for the size of the audience. Know where the restrooms and water fountains are.
 Figure out when you’re giving your speech. Will you be the only speaker, or will there be several speakers? Are you going first, last, or in the middle?


If you are given a choice, determine what time of day you’d prefer your speech. Do you tend to operate better in the morning or in the late afternoon?

, If you’re planning to use audio or visual aids in your presentation, find out if the venue can accommodate them.


Communicate presentation preferences to the organization. For example, if you prefer using a hand-held microphone over a headset, tell them. Other things to consider are using a stool, having a podium or table, and having your slides show up on a small monitor for you to use so you do not have to read off the big screen. Work these details out with the organization, instructor, or other representative before the day of your speech.
Test audio and visual aids beforehand. If your presentation aid doesn’t work during your actual presentation, you will feel heightened anxiety. Try to prevent this by testing your aids in advance.

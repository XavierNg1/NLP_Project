 Most pasta contains egg, but to be considered an egg noodle, it must contain at least 5.5 percent egg solids., When measuring egg noodles using measuring cups, 2 oz. (56 g) of egg noodles is approximately 1 1/4 cup of egg noodles and also 1 1/4 cup of cooked noodles.


Unlike macaroni pastas, egg noodles measured in measuring cups are typically the same both dry and cooked.
 Typically, for extra wide egg noodles, a 2 oz. serving equals 1 1/4 cups of dry egg noodles, which will yield approximately 1 1/2 cups of cooked noodles.

 Traditionally, the bride is not involved with the shower, but if she is hard to please, it will be easier to talk through any worries or ideas she might have at the beginning of the process and avoid confrontations that could ruin the day.;
, You can co-plan with the best man and reduce the formality of the event, leading to a more enjoyable time.
 Make sure that anyone who has a large say in what goes on at the shower, is also giving money toward its creation. Collect money in advance, if possible, to pay for reservations, catering or party favors.
 It is hard to keep a fun atmosphere for a long period of time.
 Make sure that everyone who is invited to the shower is also invited to the wedding. It can be a cause of resentment if people believe they are being solicited for gifts for a wedding that they won't be attending.
 Set up the shower layout to encourage mingling between friends and family of the bride.
 This is often a cause for worry. If the bride does not want gifts, be sure to say "No gifts" on the invitation. If the bride does want gifts, it is a good idea to create a theme around the gifts she most needs, like kitchen wares or lingerie.


The bride can also register for gifts, in which case you should include that information in the shower invitations.

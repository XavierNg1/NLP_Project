 Before you start the game, you need to choose the person who will be "IT". If no one wants to be "IT", use the eenie, meenie, minnie, moe chant. To do the eenie, meenie, minnie, moe chant, have the players stand in a line or a circle. Then, point at a different person every time you say a word. The chant goes like this: "Eenie, meenie, minnie, moe, catch a tiger by the toe. If he hollers make him pay, fifty dollars every day. My mother told me to pick the very best one and you are IT!" Make sure you're pointing at yourself as well as everyone else during the chant. You can also do "Not it!" where one player yells "One, two, three!" and everyone (including the player who says "one, two, three!") has to yell "Not it!" The last person to yell "Not it!" is "IT".;
, For hide and go seek tag, you'll need a base. It can be an old tree in your backyard, or the cherub statue in your lawn. You just need a base big enough for all the players hands to fit on it.
 Count the number of players excluding "IT", and multiply that number by ten. For example, if you have five players, subtract one for "IT", and multiply the rest (four) by five which would be 20. "IT" has to count to 20 with their eyes closed before they can go and get the other players. If you have less than five players (including "IT"), have "IT" count to twenty so the players have time to hide.
 While "IT" is counting, the rest of the players need to hide somewhere at least 20 feet (6.1Â m) from base. When "IT" says "Ready or not, here I come!" the players have to try to get to the base without "IT" tagging them. If all the players make it to base without "IT" tagging anyone, then the same person who was "IT" will be "IT" again the next round.

 Whenever you paint your nails, you want to have a nice, clean canvas. Remove any remaining nail polish currently on your nails with a cotton ball lightly soaked in nail polish remover. Cut your nails down to your desired length using nail clippers.File down your nails even more if you want them shorter, and smooth out the sharp corners of your nail.

Consider pushing back your cuticles with a manicure stick to expose a bit more of your nail bed.You can also use your thumbnail from your other hand to push back your cuticles if you don’t have a manicure stick.
 Paint on a clear base coat to protect your nails from being stained by the color in colored nail polishes.A clear base helps to extend your manicure by making chips in the polish less prevalent.

Allow your clear base coat to dry about 5-10 minutes before applying any more nail polish.
 Paint all of your nails with your base color. Your base color can be whatever color you want; it’s really up to you. To get a solid base, consider painting on two lighter coats of polish as opposed to one, thick and heavy coat.Wait a few minutes in between coats (about 5-10 minutes), so the polish has a chance to dry completely.

Two light coats of polish will increase the opacity of the color without making the layers of polish gooey.
 Unscrew the brush from the bottle, and wipe the sides of the brush on the inside neck of the bottle to remove most of the glitter polish. You want tiny glitter on the brush for your first coat of glitter.Paint over your entire nail, making sure that the top portion of your nail near your cuticle is barely speckled with glitter. The bottom portion of your nail can have a bit more glitter since it will be layered with glitter anyhow./images/thumb/6/67/Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-10-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-10-preview-Version-2.jpg

Allow this first layer of glitter to dry for at least five minutes.
 Wipe off the brush a little less this time, so there is a little more glitter on the brush. Paint the lower half of your nail, focusing on applying more glitter toward the end tip of your nail.Allow your nails at least ten minutes to dry completely.


Obviously, you can make the bottom half of your nail as glittery as you would like. Just be sure the ombré glitter gradient transitions from thin to thick, smoothly.
You can always add another coat of glitter to the bottom 1/3 or 1/4 of your nail, but then you run the risk of having a very wet nail (full of layers of polish). A wet nail heavy with polish will take a long time to dry.
Experiment to see what you think looks best and works well regarding drying time.
 Paint on a clear topcoat to seal your nails and smooth out your nail surface./images/thumb/2/2c/Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-502px-Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-11-Version-2.jpg

You may consider adding two thin coats of your top coat, only because the glitter can make the surface of your nail quite bumpy. You want all the glitter to be covered, so the glitter doesn’t get caught on any clothing or scratches your skin.

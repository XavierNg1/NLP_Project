 Go to a garden store or home improvement store and ask if they have concentrated vinegar products designed for garden use. When using stronger vinegar, it is advised to take extra caution such as wearing gloves and goggles.Most weeds will die with regular vinegar, so use that first and only use horticultural vinegar if regular doesn’t work.
Be careful not to get any on your skin as it can cause burns because of the higher concentration of acetic acid.
 Mix some dish soap into your sprayer or spray bottle. Using around a teaspoon (5 ml) per quart (liter) of vinegar is a good amount. The dish soap will help the vinegar stick to the weeds and not run off.Gently stir the soap into the vinegar, but don’t shake the bottle too much or the soap will get sudsy rather than mixing into the vinegar.
It is not necessary to carefully measure out the dish soap. Squirt an amount that seems close to a teaspoon per quart.
 Salt may not affect all weeds, but it can dry out some weeds faster than plain vinegar. You can add salt to the mixture that already has dish soap in it. Use cheap table salt rather than rock salt, Epsom salt, or sea salt.Salt tends to stay in the soil for a while and can have long-term effects on healthy plant life. If you are killing weeds in an area where you’ll plant again, it is probably best to avoid the salt.
On the other hand, if you are killing weeds in an area that you want to prevent future growth, salt can help achieve this.
It is especially important to clean a sprayer in which you added salt because it will clog up the parts and can even corrode the sprayer.

 When you are ready to attach your new watch band, you will basically be going through the same process, but in reverse. Start by carefully threading the spring bars through the loop at the top of each side of the band.


Your new band may have come with its own spring bars, but you need to make sure these fit the watch.
 Take one half of the band, and carefully place the bottom part of the spring bar into the indent in the shoulder, or case lug, of the watch. You are just putting the spring bar back to where it was before you took off the old band.


Once the bottom end of the spring bar is in the hole, carefully apply pressure downwards on the bar so you can slide the top part into the corresponding indent, or hole.
You may find it easier to use your tool to compress the spring bar when you are manoeuvring it., Now you just have to repeat this with the other half of the band. Begin by slipping the bottom part of the spring into the small hole in the case lug, and then press down and slide the top part into the opposite hole.


Listen for a slight clicking sound that indicate the bar is fixed in the place in the hole.
Once both parts of the band are in, check they are securely positioned and your band is not likely to fall off.
 If you are struggling to change the watch band, and it is proving too awkward, just pay quick visit to a local jeweller or watch store. With the right tools and some practice it is quite simple to change the band, so the jeweller will be able to do it very quickly. If you are buying a new band, the jeweller will often offer to change the band for you for free.

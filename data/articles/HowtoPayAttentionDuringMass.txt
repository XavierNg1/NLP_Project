 When you get ready to go to mass, don't think about how much cleavage you're showing, focus on looking nice for God, not the cute altar boy. Also, it's okay to wear makeup, but don't overdo it. Go for a nice natural look. Remember, God gave you the way you look as a gift, he wouldn't want you to cover it all up.;
, Really care. Before the service begins, think about this: Jesus was basically the king in heaven, He had angels and His father all adoring him then he gave all that up to come down to earth as a baby! He had to have someone else change his pants and feed him and make decisions about his life. Then, when he grew up, he gave up even his life as a human and was nailed to a cross for each and every one of us. Then he rose again! The least you could do is listen to His and God's word.
 Just listen. Imagine yourself as the people in the stories. What would you do? Respond when you need to. If you don't know what to say, pay attention to what other people say and say it next time.
 The priest will help you to understand what the readings have to do with you. Do what he says!

, Consume the body and blood of our Savior.
 Think about something you can do or stop doing and do/stop doing it!

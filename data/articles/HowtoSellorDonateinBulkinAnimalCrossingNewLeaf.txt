 If you want sell or donate a ton of things all at once, then just fill your inventory with the items you want to sell or donate. You don’t actually have to fill your entire inventory, but carry more than one. You can sell nearly anything you get you hands on, aside from certain objects, but you can only donate fossils, artwork, bugs and fish to the museum;
, Now, when you’re in the shop or the museum, when prompted to sell or donate the items in your inventory, you simply highlight everything you want to get rid of then press confirm.


Note that you can only donate fossils, art, fish and bugs you haven’t donated yet to the museum. Blathers will refuse the items you already donated, or tell you outright that you have nothing to donate if your inventory is full of things you already donated.
 Another way you can sell in bulk is by stacking items together! While you can only stack bells in all the games and and fruit in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, this can be useful when conducting trades with your friends. Just drag the individual items into one slot. Bells can be stacked near-indefinitely, but in increments. You can’t stack a 100 bell coin into a 1000 bell “bag,” but you can stack 10 units of 100 bell coins until you get 1000 bells. Fruit can be stacked into “bunches” of nine, taking up a single slot for every bunch.

 Many people who make chicken quesadillas used leftover chicken in their quesadillas. If you don't have pre-cooked chicken at your disposal, here are some ways that you can cook your chicken:


Pan-sear chicken. Season chicken with salt and pepper and begin searing it over medium heat in a well-oiled pan. To develop a nice, brown exterior, turn the heat up to medium-high just before the chicken is finished cooking.

Oven-roast chicken. This is a great way of cooking a whole chicken.

Butterfly a chicken in the oven. Another great way of cooking a whole chicken, butterflying is a quick technique that sounds more difficult than it is. Definitely worth trying!

, Cook until onions are aromatic and translucent, about 4 minutes.
 Cook until a little bit of color develops on both the corn and the onions. Remove from skillet and set aside.
, Make sure all the ingredients are evenly spread across the bottom of the tortilla.
,, To expedite the process, cover the skillet with a lid while cooking.
 Enjoy!

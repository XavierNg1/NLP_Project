Use these when something is happening in the present, has happened in the recent past, or will happen in the near future.These shows I've been watching are absolutely extraordinary.

However, in English we do not use these to refer directly to people: "These are Sean and Adrienne" is incorrect. Instead, you would say "This is Sean and this is Adrienne."
If introducing yourself, as when answering the phone, use this: "Hello, this is Chang."

 Place your feet so they are slightly more than shoulder width apart, to give you extra stability. Open your arms out to the sides, until they are parallel to the ground.
 Return slowly to the center, and then twist gently to the left side for 3 seconds. Repeat the exercise 3 times on each side.









For an advanced approach to the exercise, keep your hands closer to your legs. Grasp your right hand firmly on the right side (leg or seat), and try to join your left hand with your right hand. Grasp your left hand on your right, or on your right thigh. Hold for 10 seconds, and then repeat on the left side. Do this exercise 2 to 3 times on each side.

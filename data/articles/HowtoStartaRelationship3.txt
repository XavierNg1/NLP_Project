 Even though you are seeing each other frequently and going out on dates, the other person can’t be sure of your intentions unless you tell them. Let the person know that you are ready and interested in a relationship. You should also be willing to hear whether they want the same thing or not.For example, you could say “We’ve been going out for a while, and I know that we both enjoy being around each other. I just wanted to let you know that I am interested in a serious relationship when the time is right for both of us.”

, Once you agree to be in a relationship, there are certain rules that come with that. The tricky part is that these rules are not the same for every person or couple. You should both sit down and discuss what boundaries you expect to be followed in the relationship.For example, your partner might be okay with staying friends with exes, while that makes you uncomfortable. You discuss both sides, and agree on a set of boundaries that makes you both comfortable.
Creating boundaries can help you to find a happy medium between what makes you comfortable and what makes your partner comfortable. For example, you might agree that being friends with exes is okay, but constantly communicating with them is crossing the line.
 One of the hardest things about a relationship is that both people must be willing to compromise to make it work. That means you will have to do some things that you don’t like, and so will the other person. Keep an open line of communication about the relationship, and make sure that both people are giving and taking.For example, you might both hate doing dishes and laundry. As a compromise, one of you could do dishes, and the other do laundry.
Work to keep your lines of communication open throughout the course of your relationship. Unspoken issues may arise and create even larger problems later on if not addressed.

, Etsy only allows you to sell:


Handmade items - Anything made, assembled, or altered by your own hands. Just tailoring, restoring or repairing an item isn't enough; the design needs to be significantly changed.
Vintage goods - Items that are at least 20 years old. The items still qualifies as a vintage good if it was restored to its original condition, but if it was significantly changed, it should be listed as handmade, not vintage.
Crafting supplies - Yarn, beads, instructional books, patterns, tools.

 Use a little nail polish remover on a cotton round to wipe any existing nail polish from your nails. If necessary, clip and file your nails to achieve the desired shape. Then, paint all of your nails with a clear base coat.









The base coat will provide a smooth surface for the polish and will also protect your nails from becoming stained by the strong colors.













A quick dry base coat that will also double up as a top coat is a good option.;
, The bolder the color choices, the more your nails will pop! You will also want to make sure that at least two of the nail polishes are fairly heavy, so when you're layering the colors you won't see the base coat underneath.









If you really want to add wow factor, think about incorporating a shimmering silver or gold polish into the mix.
Good color combos include: pink, silver and red; pink, yellow and blue; gold, green and red; or white, red and purple. But it's really a matter of personal preference!

, It's important that you always apply the lightest color of the three first. Firstly, a lighter color won't work as well on top of a darker one, and secondly, the light base will allow the other colors to really stand out. Depending on the nail polish, you may need to apply more than one layer of this base color to achieve the desired effect. Once the nail polish is dry, you can apply a layer of clear top coat to add shine to your base color.









When painting your nails, try to follow the three stripe rule: first paint a vertical line down the center of your nail, then paint two more lines on either side of the central stripe. If you use broad strokes, this should be enough to cover your whole nail.
Remember that it's always better to apply multiple thin layers than one thick layer of polish. This is because the thin coats dry much faster and are less prone to smudging than thick layers.

Go to http://images.marthastewart.com/images/content/web/pdfs/2004/kids_spr04_bunny_ear_template.pdf to find a template of bunny ears. You will place the template above the bottom 2 inches (5 cm) of your envelope and draw the bunny ears upwards.
 You will need to cut through both layers of the envelope to form bunny ears on both sides. Discard the extra paper between and to the sides of the ears.
 The side without the seal will be the front of your envelope. What was once the side will now be the bottom of your envelope and the bunny's face.
 Use white construction paper if you have a pink envelope. Take your template and draw a bunny ear on the construction paper.
 Take about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) off the outline of the ears. These will be the inside of your bunny ears.

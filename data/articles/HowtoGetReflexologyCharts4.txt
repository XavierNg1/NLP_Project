 Some books have excellent, full color charts. The charts should be large enough for you to easily read.
 The colors will help you differentiate the areas of the body that correspond to the reflex points. Referring to a reflexology chart will help you practice reflexology, so try to purchase a book that contains all the information you will need.
 Buying a book that also clearly shows the meridian zones on your body is also a great help. The meridian zones are parallel energy lines that run vertically through your body and each reflex point on your foot, hand or ear is associated with the body parts within each meridian zone.

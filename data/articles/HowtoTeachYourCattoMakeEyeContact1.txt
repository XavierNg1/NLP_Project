 With an especially shy cat, you will need to start slowly. Begin by sitting as close to the cat as you can without scaring them off. Gradually, move closer and closer until you are close enough to lock eyes., Avoid facing toward the cat, as this is likely to scare them away. Instead, sit as close as you can, turning your body slightly away. Watch the cat using your peripheral vision., Remain still and keep your peripheral vision focused on the cat. Anytime your cat looks in your direction, reward them with a treat. As the cat becomes more comfortable, gradually begin turning toward them., Once the cat is comfortable with you turning toward them, you can begin to demand a bit more from them before offering a treat. Begin rewarding only actual eye contact, as opposed to every glance., Whenever the cat makes eye contact with you, begin using a verbal cue that they can associate with the action. Try saying "watch," each time the cat locks eyes with you. Then say, "very good," and offer a treat.

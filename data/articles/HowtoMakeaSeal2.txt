 If you'd like, you can make it taper towards the middle to make it easier to grab onto.
 This will give you a nice, smooth surface to work on., Many clay-working tools are too big to carve such intricate designs. Luckily, you can use just about anything to carve your design, such as a: ball-point pen, knitting needle, toothpick, stylus, or paperclip. You can also "stamp" a design into the clay. Simply find a fancy coat button or charm, and press it into the clay. Carefully pull the button or charm away. The indent is your design.
 Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the package, usually about 275°F (135°C). Once the oven is hot, stick the piece into the oven and wait the time specified on the package, usually 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the piece.
 If you'd like, you can sand the bottom of the stamp gently to make it perfectly smooth. Do this by placing a sheet of fine-grit sandpaper on a flat surface, and then rubbing the base of the stamp back and forth across it. This should not affect your design, because it is carved into the stamp. Rinse the stamp when you are done, then part it dry.
 Lightly oat your stamp with oil or water first, then press it into a puddle of melted wax or hot glue. Wait a few seconds, then pull the stamp away. For more detailed instructions, refer to the methods on making wax seals and hot glue seals.


You can also make a seal out of clay. Simply roll a bit of polymer clay into a ball, then flatten it. Rub some oil or water onto the stamp, then press it into the clay. Gently pull the stamp away, then bake the clay piece according to the package directions.

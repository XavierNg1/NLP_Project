 On the Wii game, Luigi has several unlock methods. Any one of these will earn you the green legend:


Complete 22 Brawl matches to make Luigi appear, then defeat him in one-on-one combat.
Complete Classic mode without using continues, then defeat Luigi.
Play Subspace Emissary mode until Luigi joins your team, near the end of the story.;
, Complete 800 Vs mode matches to unlock Luigi.Alternatively, you can attempt this difficult unlock method:Play the first level of Adventure mode (the Mushroom Kingdom). Wait by the end of the level and cross the finish line when the seconds place reads 2. Your time should be XX:X2:XX.
Luigi will replace Mario in the next level; defeat both opponents before the timer drops below 03:00:00. (Stage 11 will have an additional Metal Luigi, but that fight doesn't have a time requirement.)
Complete adventure mode without using continues, then defeat Luigi again once he appears after the credits.
If you're having trouble, set the difficulty to Very Easy and raise your stock to five lives. If you have the difficulty at Normal or above, finish in more than 18 minutes if you want to avoid fighting an extra boss: Giga Bowser.
 If you're playing the original Nintendo64 game, play "Bonus 1 Practice" in single-player mode. Destroy all targets before the time runs out. Repeat with all eight original characters. You'll fight Luigi with the final character you succeed with, and unlock him if you beat him.The original characters are the eight characters in the center of the character select screen: Mario, D K, Link, Samus, Yoshi, Kirby, Fox, and Pikachu.

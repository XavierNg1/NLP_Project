 Lavender is a Mediterranean herb, so it thrives in hot, sunny locations. Choose a spot in your garden where the plant will receive full sun for at least eight hours a day. The spot should also be as sheltered as possible to protect the plant from wind., Dampness is the enemy of lavender, so your most important consideration should be to choose a location where the soil is well-drained. The soil should be light, fluffy and well-aerated for optimum lavender-growing conditions. To improve soil's drainage, you can mix in a little silica sand before planting. Silica sand offers many benefits: it drains well, does not cement, and is very reflective, which helps reflect sunlight onto the plant. This is especially helpful in colder and wetter climates.Alternatively, try planting your lavender on a raised bed, at the top of a slope or beside a wall to maximize drainage., Lavender grows best in slightly alkaline conditions, with an ideal soil pH level of between 6.7 to 7.3.You can test your soil's pH level using a commercial test probe. These are available for purchase at home improvement stores and garden centers.


If necessary, you can increase the alkalinity of your soil by adding a little lime. The amount you add will depend on your type of soil and the test recommendations., There are many species of lavender available for home growing. Whether they flourish or fail will depend on the conditions in the area in which you live. The types of lavender sold at your local nursery or garden center will usually be compatible with your area's conditions, though you can check the label on the plant or ask a nursery employee if you are unsure.Mustead and Hidcote Lavender are two especially hardy varieties.
While it is possible to grow lavender from seeds, this is not recommended as the seeds require scarification and chilling and can take nearly a month to germinate.

 A cake made in ten minutes can give your sweet tooth a fix and be healthy at the same time. This pumpkin cake is perfect for a rainy fall day, or if you're a pumpkin lover, any time of year. Here's what you'll need:


3 tablespoons pumpkin puree
1 egg
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
4 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons whole wheat flour and 2 tablespoons (29.6Â ml) white flour
2 tablespoons milk
Sprinkle of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ground cloves
Small pinch of salt

, Grease a mug with butter or oil. Pour the batter ingredients into the mug. Use a spoon to completely mix the ingredients together until no lumps remain.
 Place the mug in the microwave and cook it on high for 1 1/2 minutes. Check to make sure the batter isn't overflowing; if it is, let it rest for a minute. Then close the door and cook the batter for another 1 1/2 minutes. You now have cake.
 Either invert it onto a plate or eat it straight from the mug with a spoon. Consider adding toppings like whipped cream, chopped nuts, and maple syrup.

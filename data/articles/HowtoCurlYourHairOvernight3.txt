 The sections should be even and split in a place that makes sense for your hairstyle. Keep the part of your hair in mind when choosing where to divide the hair.


If your part is in the middle, consider dividing your hair down the middle. If your part is off to one side, it might be a good idea to divide your hair using the side part.
 Take one section of your hair and twist it repeatedly until it is in a tight twist (though do not keep twisting once the section starts to twist on itself and create a bun). Take the twisted length of hair and clip it on top of your head using a crab-clip.
 Make sure both sides are clipped properly and comfortably. Remember, you'll have to sleep with this style in

, When you wake up, take out the clips and run your fingers through your hair. Set the waves but spraying them with the hair spray.

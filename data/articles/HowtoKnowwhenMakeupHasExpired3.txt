 It is often apparent when makeup has expired, as it often dries out and/or becomes clumpy. When this happens, the makeup will not apply as smoothly. Be sure to dispose of makeup that changes texture, as it can affect the quality of your skin due to the breakdown of the chemicals and the bacteria that grows.
 If you have noticed a change of color in your makeup, dispose of that particular item. Over time, the product can break down and separate, causing it to change color. When this happens, it is not likely that it will apply smoothly anyway, so you should be inclined to get rid of it.
 Any makeup that has an odd smell should be an immediate red flag. An unusual smell generally indicates that the chemical composition of the product has changed and that it has expired.


Periodically sniff your makeup to ensure that it does not have an unusual smell. If it does, toss it immediately.

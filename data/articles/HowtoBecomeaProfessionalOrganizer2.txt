 Joining a professional association, such as the National Organization of Professional Organizers or the Institute for Challenging Disorganization, is a great way to learn more about the profession and start the important process of meeting people and networking.


Join the organizations' listservs for access to the knowledge of thousands of other professional organizers.
Ask a lot of questions, attend gatherings and conferences, and be as active as you can within the association. Making a name for yourself there will give you credibility as you move forward with your career.
As you get to know professional organizers, ask if you can assist with a project. This is a good way to prove yourself and learn more about professional organizing.
 Professional organizing associations offer in-person classes ranging from Intro to Professional Organizing to Transference of Organizational Skills to guide you forward in the beginning of your career.


Some associations offer teleclasses or webinars, which are conducted online. These are generally less expensive than in-person classes.
Keep in mind that the classes offered by organizing associations don't necessarily result in a degree; rather, they are designed to educate and build confidence.
 Some companies offer training programs, with classes building toward a certification issued by that company. Some specialize in business organization, and others in personal organization.


Be sure to conduct a lot of research before signing up for a training program. These programs can be expensive, and won't necessarily lead to more clients or a better career. It's important to make sure the training program you choose is recognized as a reputable program by other professional organizers.

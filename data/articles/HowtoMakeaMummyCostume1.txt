 Old sheets work great, but you can also purchase some cheap material at fabric stores. If you don't already have something usable, try thrift stores for bargain-priced items.


You'll be cutting these up, obviously -- so if you need more than one, that's not a problem (as long as you have it!).;
, Using scissors, cut 2" to 3" (5 to 7.5 cm) slits down the side of the sheet. Don't feel the need to bust out the ruler -- if they're uneven, that's fine. Mummies look better when they're asymmetrical and full of imperfections.
 They will have a perfect mummy-style frayed edge. These become your mummy bandages.


Again, if they don't rip perfectly, don't freak out. If you absolutely must, grab a pair of scissors and start "redirecting" the rip; then, resume tearing as normal.
 The look that you are aiming to achieve is the dirty, off-white, centuries-old mummy look. To get this look you'll be dying your fabric with teabags!


Get out a large pot. Fill it 2/3 full with water and bring it to a boil.
Add in a handful of teabags. Presumably, the larger the costume wearer, the more fabric you'll be using, and the more teabags you'll need. For a child, a few is good. For an adult, kick it up to a handful.

If you don't have teabags, use watered down coffee.Stir in the material and steep for about 30 minutes to an hour.
Take the material out and let it dry. If you'd like, take some black face paint and haphazardly brush some on at random intervals. To speed up the process, throw it all in a pillowcase, tie it up, and toss it in the dryer.

The pillowcase is necessary to avoid getting a mess all over your dryer. Don't skip this part if you choose to do it!

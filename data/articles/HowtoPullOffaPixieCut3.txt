 A large headband with gems, flowers, or bows can over power your short do. For a chic, flattering look, don a thin, flat headband instead. Tuck the headband behind your ears or use it pull back your bangs., To complete your retro look, tie a colorful scarf into a “Rosie the Riveter” head wrap.


Fold your square scarf in half diagonally to create a large triangle.
Grab the left edge with your left hand and the right edge with your right hand.
Bend over and place the folded edge of the bandana along the hairline at the base of your neck. The apex of the triangle should hang down towards your forehead.
Pull both ends around your head and over the apex of the triangle. Tie the ends in a simple knot.
Stand up, tighten the knot, and tuck the two tails under the scarf.
Fold the center point over the knot.
Untuck the tails and tie a second knot.
 A scarf headband is simple and chic! To achieve this look:


Fold the scarf in half diagonally.
Fold the scarf into a long rectangle—begin at the point and fold inwards.
Take one end in each hand and place the centre of the scarf at the base of your skull.
Pull the ends up towards the top of your head and tie a knot.
Tuck the ends under the scarf or tie a bow., No hair accessory could be simpler than the bobby pin! If your pixie cut keeps falling in your eyes, bobby pins can help you tame your unruly hair. Twist your bangs and secure them on the top of your head with a bobby pin or two. Pin back the sides just above your ears to pull the hair away from your face., Make the most of a bad hair day by covering your untamable pixie with a cute hat! Wear a beanie in the winter. Put on a cloche in the spring. Don a fedora in the summer. Rock a floppy wool hat in the fall.

 Make adequate time in your schedule to devote to class and schoolwork. If done properly, getting an associate degree should be a quick process.
 Online programs often allow you to progress at your own pace. In such situations, it might be easy to get distracted. Try to treat your online education like you would a traditional education.


You should try to allot a certain amount of time per day to your education. Plan to finish your courses by a particular date and draw up a schedule that will allow you to meet your goal.
The good news is that, while popular opinion suggests that a disproportionate number of online students do not complete their programs, evidence indicates that this s not true. Online students graduate at a rate similar to that of community college students. However, online students do generally take longer to graduate., If you are less than a half-time student for more than six months, your federal student loans might go into repayment. This might mean that you will need to work more to support yourself, leaving you with even less time to complete your education. This sort of spiral can extend your education indefinitely and prevent you from graduating.


Contact your lender if your loan goes go into repayment. If you are unemployed, you might be able to claim a deferment. In special circumstances you can also get temporary forbearance, during which time you won't be required to pay, but the loan will accumulate interest., Devoting time to finishing your associate degree might mean that you need to take some time off work. Remember though, you will be able to earn more once you are finished. The quicker you graduate, the quicker you'll be able to claim a larger paycheck.

 Be calm, or at least act calm. Assume they have no qualms about killing you; it's quite likely that they don't.
 If they tell you to turn around, do so. Again, cooperate, you don't want them to shoot you. Don't do anything they don't tell you to - this will not help you with the escape. One wrong move and you could be shot.
 To do this, don't make an aggressive turn but try to act like you're following what they say to do. Once you figure out which hand the gun is in, go to the next step.
 If you act too early, you will be in the way and they could shoot you or they would try to hit you with the gun. If you wait for the gun to be at your back, you can then perform the maneuver.
 This will move the gun out of your way.
 If you can, attempt to knock the gun out of their hands.
 For example, kick it away or throw it somewhere they can't reach without having to let you go for a moment.

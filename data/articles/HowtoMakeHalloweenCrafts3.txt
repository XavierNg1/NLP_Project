 Cut a large piece of corrugated cardboard into eight strips with a utility knife or scissors. Make the first strip about two inches (5 cm) wide and nine inches (23 cm) long, and make each subsequent strip ½ in (1.25 cm) and slightly shorter than the last. Roll each strip into a circle and glue it in place with a hot glue gun, then place each circle into the next largest one at an angle and glue together to finish the horn., You can make a custom-fit mask by molding foil onto your face, then using it as a base for papier maché.

 To make oat flour, use rolled oats or quick-cooking oats. To make coarse oat bran, opt for whole oat groats.Note that you should only use whole oats if you have a durable, high-powered blender. Only use hulled oat groats; do not use raw grains.
Whole oat groats can be used to create flour, as well, but they will be much more difficult to work with and will need a longer processing time.
 Pour the oats into the blender, then shift the blender from side-to-side until the oats even out and settle between the blades.

If desired, you could use a food processor instead of a blender. Keep the oats in an even layer either way to ensure an even, consistent result.
 Switch the blender onto an appropriate speed, then allow the oats to process until they turn into powder.Use a medium to high speed when working with rolled or quick-cooking oats. If using whole oat groats, keep the machine on a high speed.
Pause the machine every 15 to 20 seconds. Stir the oats, directing larger pieces closer to the blades, and continue grinding as needed.
Stop processing the oats once they reach your desired consistency. Within one or two minutes, the oats should develop into a coarse to fine powder.
 You can use the oat flour or bran immediately, but if you don't need it yet, you can also store it at room temperature in an airtight container.

Coarse oat powder can be used as bran meal. Fine oat powder can be used as flour.
To retain the full nutritional value, use bran or flour made from fresh oats immediately.
When starting with store-bought rolled oats or quick oats, keep the finished product until the expiration date marked on the original container of oats.

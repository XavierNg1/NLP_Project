 Hit ⊞ Win and enter “Device Manager” and select it from the search results. The Device Manager lists the hardware in your computer as well as the driver versions installed.
 This will display a list of your graphics hardware, including the brand and model information.


You can check the installed driver version by right-clicking and selecting properties, then clicking the “Drivers” tab.
 Depending on what information was listed in the Device Manager, you will either need to go to the Nvidia, AMD, or Intel website.
 This information can be determined from the Device Manager listing.


For example: an AMD Radeon R9 M300 notebook card would classify as a 'notebook card' for type, 'R9' for series, and 'M300' for the model of that series.
Some driver sites also offer a tool you can download to automatically scan your hardware to determine which driver you should download.
 It is important that you download the driver for your exact model and operating system to avoid errors.


If you are unsure which operating system you are running, you can view this information in “Control Panel > System”. Take note of the information listed next to “System Type” (32-bit or 64-bit), as these will utilize different drivers.
 The installer will automatically uninstall the outdated drivers and install the new one. You will be prompted to restart your computer during installation - the process will not complete without doing so.
 If you are still encountering issues, it is likely not caused by compatibility issues with the graphics driver. If your graphics card meets the system requirements of the game and you suspect your problem is graphics related, you can try to install or upgrade DirectX.

 This method requires adult supervision because working with the knife can be dangerous. Because you are working with a hard-boiled egg, you do not need a sharp knife. It needs to be slender enough to fit through the mouth of the bottle.


Make sure the knife is long enough to reach into the bottle and cut the egg.
This method does not keep the egg intact after removal.
 The smaller the pieces, the easier it will be to remove them from the bottle.


If you donâ€™t have a knife, you can also use a spoon to break up the egg into pieces.
 Turn the bottle upside down and shake out the pieces. Hit the bottom of the bottle to get as much out as possible. Hold the bottle over a garbage can during this process to make clean-up easier.


You may not be able to get every little bit out, but this will get the larger pieces out. You can get the rest out by washing the bottle.
 If you want to use this bottle for anything in the future, you will need to rinse it out. There will likely be residue from the egg stuck to the sides of the bottle. Fill the bottle with warm water and swirl it around to remove the remaining egg.


Add some dish soap to really get the bottle clean.

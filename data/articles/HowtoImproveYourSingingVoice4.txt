 Look up vocal coaches in your area online. Watch their example videos to get a sense of their teaching style and their demeanor as a coach.Keep in mind, a good singer does not always make a good vocal coach. A good vocal coach should be able to explain singing concepts well and be willing to guide your through even the most basic singing techniques.
Another good way to find a quality vocal coach is to ask any friends, colleagues, or peers who are strong singers to recommend a vocal coach they have used themselves or heard good things about., If possible, meet the teacher in person first before you hire them. Ask them several questions to ensure you will be comfortable taking lessons from them:What is your teaching methodology, and how are lessons conducted?
What is the strength in my singing voice, and how would I use it and build on it?
What is the weakness in my singing voice, and how would you guide me to correct or improve on it?
If the vocal coach cannot answer these three questions, they may not have enough experience to help you or they have not thought deeply enough about how to conduct singing lessons.
 This applies not only to working with a vocal coach but with working on your singing in general. Singing, even badly at first, will help you identify the flaws in your voice and improve your technique. A good vocal coach will be supportive of your learning, even if you start off with a rocky or rough singing voice.

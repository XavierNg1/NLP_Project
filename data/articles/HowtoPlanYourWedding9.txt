 Many couples book a honeymoon suite the night of their wedding to begin the feeling of a honeymoon before leaving the town or city of the wedding, while others simply get going straight after the wedding. The choice is entirely your own.
 You may need to reserve a block of rooms for guests that will be attending your wedding from interstate or overseas. Booking as a group will usually ensure they all get the best rate but this should be done well in advance of the wedding, at least four months in advance.


Make it clear whether you're footing the bill for guests or not. You can clarify that you've booked rooms at a special rate but expect them to cover the costs if need be. Be careful about expecting too much from far-traveled guests; they already have to fund their journey, so if you can reduce their accommodation costs, that's all the better.
 This will let you take advantage of any special deals and good prices. Book as soon as possible but always build flexibility into the bookings in case of the need for cancellation; it is better to pay a little more and get most of your money back if something prevents the travel (such as illness, postponing the wedding, etc.) than to get back nothing.

 You don't have to spend up to $10 for a stupid bandage at Walmart, just buy a good, sturdy $2 one at the Pharmacy.;
, It would look strange and suspicious if you wore neon sneakers with a big ace bandage around your leg.
 (the part between the toes and your heel). Alternate until the bandage is too short to go any further. Tuck it in the top, pin it in place to hold it.
 Make sure it's realistic, for example "I was riding my bike and fell off from hitting a big rock" is much more believable than "I was hit by a plane".

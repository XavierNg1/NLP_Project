 While the most popular tapa is made with beef, there are many variations in Filipino cooking, including:



Tapang Usa: Venison

Tapang Baboy Ramo: Wild Boar

Tapand Kabayo: HorseYou can also try pork shoulder or pork belly, or use different cuts of beef, like a roast.
 Usually you need to add some sugar too to cut the sourness a bit, but this recipe gives your tapa a nice sweet & sour flavor.


Feel free to mix and match too, using half vinegar and half lemon juice.
 Sugar can also help the outside of the beef caramelize, but you will need to turn it more frequently to prevent burning.
 An extra tablespoon of black pepper, cayenne, or even a tablespoon of Sriracha will all make deliciously spicy tapa.
 For some people, cooking the meat with the liquid leads to a dish that is too tough for their preferences. You can always drain the liquid before cooking if you want crispier meat. Use 1-2 tablespoons of high heat oil (vegetable, sesame, canola) to fry the meat instead of cooking it with the liquid.

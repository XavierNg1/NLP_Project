 The best way to keep your cat safe on Independence Day is by bringing it inside. Before any guests arrive, bring your cat inside. This will help prevent your cat from getting spooked and running away as a result of fireworks and other festivities., Designate a room in your house where your cat will hang out during Independence Day celebrations. This room will serve as a comfortable retreat from holiday mayhem. For example, you can designate a room with a door, like a bedroom, as your cat’s safe space.Make sure the space has a litter box, food, water, a bed, and your cat’s favorite toys.
 Once you designate a safe retreat for your cat, you should shut the door and not let guests enter the room. Make sure you inform guests when they arrive that your cat’s safe space is off limits. You can also post a sign on the door., Many cats are afraid of the festive noises that are part of many Independence Day celebrations. Try leaving soft music playing in your cat’s safe space. This will help cover up abrupt and disturbing noises, like fireworks.You can also leave a television on to muffle the sound of fireworks.
 It might be comforting to your cat if you are present while the fireworks are going off. Some cats may want to be pet and comforted, while others might choose to isolate themselves. Do what works best for your cat.

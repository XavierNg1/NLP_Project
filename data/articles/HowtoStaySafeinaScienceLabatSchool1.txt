 One of the most important aspects of lab safety is preventing your body from being exposed to contaminants. The first step in wearing proper protective equipment (PPE) is coming to lab prepared with long pants and closed-toe shoes. Shoes with a hard top are preferred in case you drop something on your feet.Once you get to lab, you will put on the rest of the PPE that will cover any other exposed parts of your body.
Tuck in loose, baggy clothing and roll up long sleeves.;
, The lab coat is essential for protecting you and your clothes from spills and other chemicals. It can quickly be removed in case of a spill. The lab coat needs to fit you well in order to be effective. Wear your lab coat whenever you are doing anything in the lab.


If the sleeves are too long they can get in the way and be cumbersome while working.
 Goggles do not have to be worn at all times, but they must be worn when handling chemicals or working with anything with a splash or explosion hazard.


Goggles must wrap around the sides of your face to protect the eyes from all sides.
 There are a number of different types of gloves that you may need to wear depending on what you are working with. For basic safety and protection from harmful chemicals, disposable latex or nitrile gloves will be worn. This is most likely what you will be using in your lab at school.


If you are working with extremely hot or extremely cold substances, you will need to wear special gloves that are temperature appropriate.
When working with anything that conducts electricity and could be a shock hazard, you need to wear rubber gloves.

, Cut the tree's very top tip - called the leader - back less than halfway but at least 2 inches (5.1Â cm) at a 45 degree angle. Because the leader controls the growth hormone, trimming the leader a few inches every year promotes fuller growth.
 Use an imaginary line from the top to the ground at a 60 to 70 degree angle. Any branches that protrude past that line should be trimmed back.

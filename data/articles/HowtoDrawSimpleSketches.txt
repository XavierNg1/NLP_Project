 Visualize it in your mind and if you can, rotate it in your brain, to better understand what you'll be drawing.;
, to relate to. This will aid in the shading process, and even help you sketch look better if you understand the basic shape of what you are about to draw.
 If you are uncomfortable, your drawing will look worse than what it should, so get a nice chair, fix the lighting and put on some favorite music.

 If you think you sketched lines too close or too far apart, erase them. Too many sketch lines on a drawing makes it look like your drawing is twisting. Going over the same line many times can make it dark and hard to erase if you decide it's wrong.
 To add value, on the darker, shaded parts of the object you're drawing, shade them on your sketch. Go from a very dark, and lighten it gradually to a very light shade.
 It'll make your drawing look better, and add some theme to it.
 Traditionally, after a sketch, artists lightly add their signature (Yes, in cursive) to the bottom right corner of their drawing. You can also add something like '13 to it, too if you'd like.

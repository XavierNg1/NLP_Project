 Beyond seeking professional help, the most effective way to cope with suicidal thoughts is to spend time with people who love you. They can help you stay positive, distract you from your negative thoughts, and offer comfort.

Resist the urge to isolate yourself from family and friends. Let these people be there for you.Keep in mind that it is okay to take time to recover after socializing. If you find that you need some time alone after being around people all day, then allow yourself to have this time.
 Teens need a great deal of sleep to be at their best. When you lack sleep, negative thoughts and worries can grow in your mind, worsening your condition. Try your best to get at least nine to ten hours of sleep each night. If this is hard for you, then look at your schedule to find activities that you might cut to provide more time for sleep.

Improve your sleep by shutting off anything with a screen at least an hour before bed. Take a warm bath, listen to calming (not sad) music, perform a self-massage, and do some light reading.If you have trouble sleeping many nights on end, see a doctor. They may recommend you take a non-habit forming sleep aid to help you get the rest you need.
 Staying involved in activities at school can help you maintain contact with friends and boost your mood. What’s more, if you participate in sports, you receive the added benefit of mood-lifting endorphins that will improve your outlook on life.If you don’t enjoy sports, then look into other physical activities that you might enjoy.
 Staring at a screen for hours on end won’t help you feel better. Plus, negative media and social media can worsen your suicidal thoughts and feelings. Make the choice to unplug and engage in positive distractions instead.

Self-care may include lighting a scented candle, watching a favorite movie, or planning a sleepover with a best friend. Just do things that nourish your mental health and help you cope with negative feelings.

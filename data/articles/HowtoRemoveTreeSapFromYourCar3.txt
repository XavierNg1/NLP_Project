 Make sure to get all the dirt and grime off the surface around the sap. If attempting to get the sap off with the hot water and soap doesn't work, continue with these steps.


Even if the wash doesn't get the sap off, the warmth of the water will begin to soften it, making it easier to remove. This is also helpful if the sap has been on the car for a while.



Try mineral spirits or alcohol wipes. Mineral spirits applied lightly with a soft cloth will break down the sap and remove it but it has the potential of damaging your car's surface. Do not rub too vigorously or for too long so that the paint job is not damaged.
Mineral spirits and alcohol wipes should be tried separately. Use the previous directions and try with mineral spirits. If that fails, use readily available 91% isopropyl alcohol instead of mineral spirits. Alcohol evaporates quickly and although your cloth will seem wet, it is the water that is left after the alcohol evaporates. Keep your cloth wet with fresh alcohol and move quickly with light pressure. This will easily remove hard dried as well as fresh pine tree sap.
Spray WD-40 on the tree sap.The sap will begin to absorb the solvent. Let it sit for a few minutes. You can use your rag to lift the loosened sap from the car.
Rub hand sanitizer on the tree sap. Place a small amount of hand sanitizer on the sap and let it set for a few minutes. Rub with a clean cloth and the sap dissolves right off., The car wash will help remove any residue left over from the sap or the cleaner used to remove it. Any solution that would deteriorate paint will be washed away. A new coating of wax is recommended to renew the protective coating on the vehicle.

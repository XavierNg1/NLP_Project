 Whatever boundaries you set, you have to maintain them during the visit. It is generally best if your spouse addresses the boundaries with your in-laws when possible. This will show that you are both on the same page.For example, if your in-laws try to feed your kids candy before dinner, your spouse could step in and say something like, “The kids need to eat their dinner first, but they can have sweets after. That’s our rule.”

, When your spouse isn’t available to address boundaries, you should step in and maintain your boundaries. You should also make conversation with your in-laws directly and not leave it up to your spouse to do all of the entertaining. This will help build a relationship between you and your in-laws and make future visits less awkward.For example, if one of your in-laws says something that you find offensive, you could address it by saying something like, “Please don’t say things like that around me. You are entitled to your opinion, but hearing you say such things bothers me.”

, Keeping a routine helps everyone. However, this is especially important if you have kids because you need to maintain the sense of normalcy. Make sure that everyone is still going to work, school, and extracurricular activities during the visit. This will make the visit more enjoyable, and make it easier to return to normal life once the visit is over., Keeping to a normal schedule doesn’t mean that you have to exclude your in-laws. Let them come along to extracurricular activities with the kids. You could even enlist their help to drop off or pick up kids from school and/or babysit in the evenings. They will enjoy getting to spend time being involved with their family, and you may get a break, as well., You are not obligated to entertain your guests around the clock. If you need to unwind, you can take a walk or go to bed early. Just politely excuse yourself and take the space you need.

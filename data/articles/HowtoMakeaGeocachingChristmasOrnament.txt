 Take care to choose items which are not likely to decay quickly.


Check that any naturally sourced items are fully dried before using them; this will prevent the growth of mildew.;
, These come in two styles. Both can work for this project, but the one with two halves that snap together is the easiest to use. The clear ones with only a small hole at the top will restrict you to only very small fill items.
 The cheap thin ones with no lines can often be had 5-for-a-dollar or less.

Cut the memo pad into a half inch/13mm by one inch/2.5 centimeter (1.0Â in) rectangle, with the narrow edge on the spiral.



You can make fictitious log entries if you like. TFTC (thanks for the cache) and TN LN (took nothing, left nothing) or SL (signed log) can fit easily on the tiny pages, but your imagination is the only limiting factor here.
 Items which work well include: teeny white pom pom balls for "snow", twigs cut short, acorns, pine tips from old holiday sprays, silk holly leaves and berries, cut pine needles, small (preferably smooth) pebbles, etc.
 Adjust the contents as necessary. It may be helpful to include a small geocaching sticker on the outside of the ornament to help complete the illusion of a teeny geocache hanging on your tree., Use clear stickers or even clear stickers with natural items such as trees, flowers, etc printed on them to seal the seam shut.

You can also use super glue to seal the halves together, but be aware that the glue can turn the plastic opaque and is not easily removed.
 Hang it where it can be closely inspected by the curious. Or, gift wrap it for a friend who is a cacher!

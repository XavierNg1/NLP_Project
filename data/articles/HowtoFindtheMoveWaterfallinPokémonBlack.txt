Defeating your rival, Cheren, at the entrance to Twist Mountain.
Talking to Alder at Twist Mountain, who will then give you HM Surf.;
, Waterfall is on a series of cliffs across the ocean from Route 1. Head over with a Pokémon who knows Surf., It is on the southern end of the Route, near your starting town and a patch of wild grass.
 You'll reach land again, where there are two trainers and some wild grass. Follow the road to the south-west (down and left) until you hit a tunnel., You'll reach another ocean. Use surf to hop in again.
 You'll run into some trainers and some Pokémon on the way, but nothing insanely difficult. Eventually, you'll reach a large landmass with giant staircases. Head up them to continue your journey.
 On the farthest left portion of the area is a high bluff, only 1-square across, covered in high grass. HM Waterfall is at the southernmost tip of it.

 Nearly every smartphone released after 2007 has Bluetooth, all you need to do is enable it by going to your Settings and switching Bluetooth to "On" or "Enabled." If you are unsure about whether or not your device has bluetooth, consult your user manual., This is usually found in the upper right-hand corner of a Mac or the lower-right hand corner on Windows. Bluetooth is backwards compatible, so almost any Bluetooth enabled device will be able to connect to another.
 Your cell phone should be listed as an available device in the Bluetooth File Transfer Window. If it is not, double-check that you have enabled Bluetooth. If you find that you are still having connectivity issues, try physically touching your device to your computer in order to ensure that the two can discover each other. If you continue to have issues, check for updates or other problems within your device.
 You will find this in a drop down menu after you select your phone.
 Once you have selected your device, find the photos you wish to update and select "Next." This will prompt your photos to be uploaded to your computer and it may take a few moments to complete the process.
 Once you have uploaded your photos, you may want to disconnect from Bluetooth in order to save your deviceâ€™s battery from draining.

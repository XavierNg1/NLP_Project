 You can use the tools that come with Ubuntu to create ISO files without any additional software.
 This program comes preinstalled with Ubuntu, and can quickly create ISO files from discs.


You can find Brasero by pressing âŠž Win and then typing "brasero."

, The "Copy CD/DVD" window will appear.
 If you only have one disc drive, it will be selected by default.
 This will create an image file from the original disc instead of copying it to a blank one.
 You'll be prompted to give the image file a name and select the location you want to save it to. After that, Ubuntu will begin creating the ISO file from the disc inserted in the computer.
 if you'd rather use the Terminal, you can create an ISO file using a single command. Open the Terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and enter the following:sudo dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/home/username/image.iso
Replace /dev/cdrom with the path to your disc drive. Replace the path for the ISO file with whatever path you'd like to save it to.

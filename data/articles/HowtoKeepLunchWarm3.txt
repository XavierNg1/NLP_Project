 Remember that you should heat food up to the boiling point of 212 °F (100 °C). You can also just heat up some water to do this test.Heat the food or water in the microwave or in a pan on the stovetop until the liquid is boiling.
If you have a food thermometer, then you can also measure the temperature to ensure that it is at the boiling point.
 Next, transfer the food or water to your preheated thermos. After you have placed your hot food in the thermos, seal the thermos tightly.








Remember that you should always preheat your thermos by filling it with boiling water and letting the water sit for about 10 minutes. Discard the water after 10 minutes and immediately put in your hot food or water.
 Note the time that you put your food or water into the thermos for your test. Consider how long after packing the lunch you would usually be eating or when your child would usually be eating lunch.For example, if you normally pack lunch at 7:30am and then eat at 12:30pm, then you should wait five hours to determine if your thermos is effective.
 After you have waited for the amount of time that your food would normally be in the thermos, open it up and check the temperature.If the food is still warm, then you have a good thermos that will keep your food warm for lunch. If it is cold, then you may want to find a different thermos or try the test again and heat the food or liquid to a higher temperature.
If you have a food thermometer, then you might even check the temperature to ensure it is near the safe range of 140 °F (60 °C). If it is a degree or two off, then this is nothing to worry about. However, if the temperature is much lower, such as 100 °F (37.8 °C), then it might not be safe to eat.

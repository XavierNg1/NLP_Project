 You don't have to use money or material goods--that may spoil their love of learning. Of course, snacks, drinks and offering things they like to do are always good ideas.


Save the big rewards for school tests. Once they can perform under pressure, you know you've been successful.
 Don't forget to pause and have fun between serious repetitions of the facts. If you're happy with their success, they'll be more likely to want to be successful. Show them how awesome they're doing with verbal recognition.

 No child can learn for hours on end. When you sense that they're wearing down, take a break. You probably need one, too.


After a break, quickly review what they've already learned before moving onto new facts.

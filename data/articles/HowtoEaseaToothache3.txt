 When the over the counter medication doesn't eliminate your pain (or even if it does) you should definitely see your dentist or doctor, because this could be an emergency.








This is especially true if you have extreme pain and swelling.
Fever along with submandibular lymph nodes swelling is an important sign of infection in dental disease. Basic tooth decay doesn't cause a fever.
 If it's on the second or third day after you get a tooth pulled then you need to see a dentist within 24 hours. This is called "dry socket syndrome" and happens sometimes when the tooth socket is being exposed to the air causing an intense pain that is hard to calm down even with medication.
 This could be due to a traumatic injury, in which case you should be seeking medical help as quickly as possible. Things like swallowed teeth and permanent tooth loss are considered dental emergencies

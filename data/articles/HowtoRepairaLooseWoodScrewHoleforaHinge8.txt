 Probably the most permanent way is to use decking screws about 5 inches (12.5 cm) long, especially if it is an exterior door.
, This will permanently anchor the door into place and will last for many years. The reason for the extra long screws is that they have to pass through the jamb and through a couple of inches of empty space before hitting the framing stud in the wall. This is so effective that it is generally only necessary to use a couple of the decking screws per hinge.

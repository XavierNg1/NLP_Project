 Many makeup counters will hire people who haven't gone to beauty school, but if you have the time and money, it's worth learning techniques from people who have been in the business for years.


The curriculum will vary between schools, but usually covers both basic skills like wedding makeup and more advanced skills like special-effects makeup. Remember that while these courses help, they cannot replace the benefits of practice, experimentation, and natural talent.
Consider becoming a licensed cosmetologist, as this will give you an advantage over your competitors.
Decide which field(s) of makeup artistry you would like to work in to determine which classes will be most beneficial for you.
 Apply for positions at department stores and beauty stores. You'll have the opportunity to practice your skills on hundreds of people with different complexions, styles and expectations. Best of all, you'll get paid to practice your skills.


Retail experience is helpful for landing jobs in department and beauty stores, since your job will be selling cosmetics in addition to your makeup artistry services.
Positions in beauty salons and spas may require more experience, but don't hesitate to apply if you're interested.
If finding a job proves difficult, try landing an internship instead. Go to your favorite spa and salon to ask about internship or apprenticeship programs, making it clear that you're eager to get real-world experience in the makeup industry.

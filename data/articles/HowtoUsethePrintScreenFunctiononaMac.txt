 Find the screen that you want to capture and then press Command + Shift +3. This will take a picture of your entire screen. You will even hear the sound of the camera shutter going off to confirm that you've captured the screenshot.;
, To do this, simply press Command + Shift + 4. This will turn your mouse into a tool that can select any rectangular portion of the screen. The tool will look a bit like a plus sign. Once the tool comes up, you can release the other keys.


Then, click and hold your mouse, drag the tool until you've created the desired rectangular shape, and release the mouse when you're ready to take the screenshot.
 This is a great option if you have an opened window and want to take a picture of it without your desktop in the background or anything else that has popped up over the screen as a distraction. Press Command + Shift + 4 + space bar and wait for the tool that makes the rectangular screen to transform into a camera.


Then, move the camera around with your mouse until you've chosen the screen you want -- it will become faded.
 Just double-click on the file to open it. If you'd like to save your screenshots to the clipboard instead of to a permanent file, just press Control along with the other functions the next time you take a screenshot.
 If you'd actually like to print the screen shot, just click on "File" and then "Print" and "Print" again.

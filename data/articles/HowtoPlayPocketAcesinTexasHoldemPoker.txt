 Don't do a double-take, or laugh, or smile, or play a smokescreen by frowning. All you need to do is remain neutral. Look at your chips, or even think about what you had for breakfast yesterday. This way no one will guess you have pocket rockets (A-A).;
, If you are big/small blind, you might like to just call if someone raised before you. If you are the first to bet, just call the big blind, or if you want, you can raise by a small portion (eg. If it is 4 to call, bet 6 or 8). Don't push all in, or bet something like 5 times the blind. Put in as many raises as possible, especially if you are out of position. Never re-raise pre-flop.
 If someone goes all in preflop, you should call them. Let some people get out, and then win that money back over time. That's how pros play.
 Play accordingly to the following situations (play the style that is most like the flop):


High cards: K - 10 - J = Raise to about 10, or call a bet of a similar value (up to 30). Be wary of all in because it is possible to have a straight.






The triple: A - 6 - 10 = Do a small raise on most anything.






Quick straight: 5 - 7 - 6 = Be wary, but call for now.






Nothing: 4 - 8 - 2 = Small raise on anything.






Dangerous: K - K - Q = Call for now, but later on, fold to a raise from a conservative player.
 If the river shows there are 4 cards in a row, be wary of the small raise. Play likewise for suited cards (of which you have none). Play a small raise here., If this doesn't give you 3 aces, be wary of a large raise. If you are looking good though, raise the raise. If they then raise, just call., If you win the hand, allow yourself a small smile, but don't gloat. If you lose, keep thinking about yesterday's breakfast. Don't let them get an idea of how you react., And say good game. People will play worse when you mess with them.

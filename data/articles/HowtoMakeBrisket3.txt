 Besides typical barbecue or stove-cooked beef brisket, several other iconic dishes are made from the same "brisket" cut of meat at the front of the cow. For instance, corned beef, the tender, salty dish often associated with St. Patrick's Day celebrations and Irish cuisine, is usually made from brisket. Rather than being roasted or grilled, corned beef is usually brined in salt water, then boiled and stewed with vegetables and seasonings to give it its characteristic texture and taste.
 Though traditionally made from a cut called "beef plate", pastrami is often also made from brisket. Like corned beef, pastrami is typically brined . After this, the meat is seasoned, smoked, and steamed to produce a zesty final product with a characteristic reddish color. This tender, delicious deli meat makes for great sandwiches, especially when paired with a hot mustard.
 Pot roast, a style of dish that often uses cuts of meat from the tough "chuck" region of the cow, can be replicated with brisket fairly easily. As with chuck pot roasts, brisket pot roasts are made by quickly browning the outside of the meat on a grill or in a pan or skillet, then slowly cooking the meat for hours in a pot containing water or beef stock and various seasonings and spices. Cooked in this way, a piece of brisket can make for a delicious, mouthwatering-ly tender pot roast that can serve as the centerpiece of any great feast.

 Use marker or paint to darken the lines drawn with your pencil or chalk. Make bold, thick lines. This is graffiti, so it doesn't have to look nice and neat; the lines should be expressive. When you're done, erase any pencil or chalk lines skill peeking through.
 Fill all the letters in with just one color or experiment with lots of different hues. Graffiti artists traditionally had to work secretly for fear of getting caught - many still do - and so they could carry only one or two different colors of spray paint at a time - a lot of very good graffiti is just one color. If you want to try more than one, think about these options:









You can do each letter in a different color or make the added details a different color than the letters.
Try an ombre-style work of art with colors that gradually fade from one to the next. To create a sunset-like appearance, make the top part of the letters red, then blend that into orange, and fade into yellow at the bottom.
For a bolder 3-D effect, color in the shaded edges of the letters with a darker color than the faces of the letters.
 Now that the name is complete, make it stand out by painting the background area a different color. If your name looks dark, paint a brighter background behind it; if it's light, set it against a dark color. Your work of graffiti art is sure to make people stop and stare.

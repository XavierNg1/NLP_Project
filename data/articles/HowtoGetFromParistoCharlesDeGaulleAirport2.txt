 Depending on where in Paris you are starting from, a taxi ride to Charles de Gaulle may be expensive. However, it is convenient and you will be dropped off at the terminal you need.


Expect to pay around 50 euro for a tax fare from the center of Paris to the airport. Taxis are more expensive on weekends and also at nighttime. (the night means between 5 to 7 pm and 7 to 10 am, depending on whether you use a city or suburban taxi).
Leave at least 45 minutes to get from the center of Paris to the airport.
Call one of the Paris taxi companies that specialize in airport drop offs. These include Alpha Taxis (tel: 01 4585 8585), Les Taxis Bleus (tel: 0891 701 010), Taxis G7 (tel: 01 4739 4739), 01 4270 0042).
 You can take the metro from many points in Paris to a connecting RER train, which stops at airport terminals.


Ride from the center of Paris for about 9 or 10 euro. The trip will take 25 minutes.
 Local buses 350 and 351 stop at every terminal and run directly from Paris. The trip will take 45 to 60 minutes and cost 10 euro.


Use a shuttle bus service. These are larger and more comfortable than the city buses, and they leave every half hour from select stops close to Paris metro stations and bus stops. The cost is 18 euro and the shuttles drop passengers off at Terminal 2E and 2F only.

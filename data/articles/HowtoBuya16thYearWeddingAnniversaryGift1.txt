 Each wedding anniversary has a theme. You can find lists of these themes online. Some people say the 16th doesn't have a traditional theme, but others say it's wax.


For example, the first anniversary is traditionally paper. The second is cotton, the third is leather, the fourth is fruit or flowers, the fifth is wood, the sixth is sugar or iron.
The seventh is wool or copper, the eighth is bronze or pottery, the ninth is pottery or willow, the 10th is tin or aluminum, the 11th is steel, the 12th is silk or linen, the 13th is lace, the 14th is ivory, the 15th is crystal. And, yes, the 16th is wax.
Don’t worry, it gets harder than wax. The 19th anniversary is chili pepper.;
, The traditional anniversary themes get a little goofy. After all, is your significant other really desiring chili pepper? How many people want a gift out of tin? Maybe wax doesn’t sound very romantic (although candles are always nice).


Thus, modern themes have emerged. The modern theme for the 16th wedding anniversary is often described as silver hollowware. Silver hollowware simply means hollow silver.Some gift ideas for silver hollowware are a silver tea set, flask, ice bucket, silver locket, wine goblets, or a fountain pen. You could put flowers in a silver vase.
 Explain it to your significant other so it doesn’t seem like you’re choosing a theme without thought.


Historically, silver meant awareness, clarity, and vision! Silverware can also represent family and connectedness. It can symbolize union because people sit down together when they use it.Don’t feel badly if you decide to mix it up. Instead of silver hollowware, for example, maybe you just go with silver. That’s OK. You could give your significant other a silver dipped flower or just anything with the precious metal.

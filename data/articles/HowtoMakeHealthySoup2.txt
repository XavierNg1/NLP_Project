 Finely chop the shallots and celery, then add them to a large saucepan with 2 teaspoons of oil. Cook the shallots and celery over medium heat for 2 minutes., Chop off the thick stem and leaves from half a head of cauliflower, then cut it into small florets. Peel and slice the potatoes, then add both into the saucepan.


For a twist, use sweet potatoes instead of Yukon gold potatoes. They will give your soup an extra dose of beta-carotene and vitamin A., Chicken broth is recommended, but if you are vegan or vegetarian, you can use vegetable broth instead. Use low-fat, low-sodium broth if you can; this will give you a healthier soup in the end.
 Reduce the heat to low, then let the soup simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. You are ready for the next step when the vegetables turn soft and tender.
 It would be best to use freshly-squeezed lemon juice, but if you can't get any, bottled lemon juice is fine. This will help bring out the other flavors in your soup.
 Measure out half of the soup, and pour it into a food processor or blender. Pur√©e the soup until it is smooth, then pour it into another saucepan or into two bowls. Repeat with the remaining half of the soup.


Scrape the sides of the food processor or blender from time to time. This will shift any lumps or clumps back towards the bottom, and give you a smoother soup.
The longer you blend the soup, the smoother it will become.
 If you poured the soup into a separate saucepan, now is the time to divide it evenly between four soup bowls and serve it. If you'd like, you can garnish the soup with some croutons and chives. Id you have any leftovers, store them in the fridge or freezer.

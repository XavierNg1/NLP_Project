 You can make neutral, complementary, or primary gray using polymer clay. Choose whichever option appeals most to you.


If you want to create a pure gray without any tint, it's best to create a neutral gray.
If you do want to tint the gray, though, primary or complementary grays can simplify the process and reduce your overall number of supplies.
 Grab equal amounts of each involved color. Knead the colors separately, then knead them together.


Your color options are:

Black and white
Blue and orange
Red and green
Yellow and purple
Red, yellow, and green


To knead the colors together, simply stick the separate colors together and roll the mashed ball in between your hands, flattening and re-rolling as needed. Continue until no marbling remains. The colors should be evenly mixed into a solid gray.
 If you want to lighten the color without changing its value, knead a pinch of translucent clay into the ball of gray.Translucent clay has no color, so it won't change the shade or hue of the gray. Instead, it will simply make the gray seem duller and less vibrant.
When choosing how much translucent clay to use, the total amount should not exceed one-third the total amount of your gray clay.
 When you want to lighten the actual shade of the gray, knead a small amount of white into the existing ball.


You can add white regardless of the colors used to create the original gray.
While you could technically darken the color by adding black, it can be difficult to mix black clay into other colors without ruining them. Darkening neutral gray in this manner is much easier, though, since it already contains a black component.
 Once you're satisfied with the saturation of color and shade, determine whether or not you want to add a tint.


Tint the clay by mixing in small amounts of one color.
You should be able to use nearly any color when tinting neutral gray, but you'll need to stick with one of the original colors when tinting complementary or primary grays.

 Before you start painting, you want to give yourself a gorgeous canvas to work on. You can purchase nail polish remover from your local drugstore. If your nails are prone to drying out and flaking, look for a remover labeled “non-acetone.” These are gentler on your nails, and you don’t want to dry out your nails right before giving yourself a manicure!

, No matter how beautifully you create your floral nail art, it won’t look perfect if your nails are jagged, uneven, or misshapen. Before painting them, it’s important to trim and file them. First, choose the shape you want for your nails. Some people prefer square tips with sharp edges, while others prefer soft rounded nails.Trim your nails so that they are all the same length. Leave a little extra length when trimming, because they’ll get a bit shorter from filing.
File your nails with the nail file using short, smooth strokes. You’ll see your nail slowly starting to take shape, and continue until you are satisfied.
Double check that all your nails are the same length and shape. Make sure you don’t have any hang nails.
 Choose a color that will provide a nice backdrop for your flowers. Roll the polish between your palms to get it all mixed and ready. Don’t shake, as that will cause air bubbles that can dry out your polish.








Dip the brush into the polish, being careful not to overload the brush with polish.
Try to use only three strokes to apply the polish to your fingernail. If necessary, use a few more strokes to distribute the polish evenly on your nail.Let your base coat dry fully before moving on to the flowers. You can let it air dry, or speed up the process by blow-drying them with cold air.

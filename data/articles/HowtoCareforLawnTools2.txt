 Prevent any tools that utilize a pivot (like shears) from getting stuck in place during use. Clean the blades thoroughly to remove any sap or debris that might find its way into the pivot point. Once they’re dry, add a couple drops of lubricating oil to the pivot point.Don’t use spray cans for this. These oils tend to evaporate pretty fast. You want to apply drops rather than a quick spray so the oil has time to penetrate the pivot’s parts and settle in.
 Rub them down with lubricating oil. Then file the blades with a flat mill file. For best results, hold the file at a 20 to 45 degree angle with the blade’s sharp edge as you work. For an even sharper blade, follow up by doing the same with a whetstone.Do so at the start of the spring season so all of your blades are ready to go when you need them. Repeat as needed if any begin to dull over the course of the spring, summer, and fall.
 Expect these to work loose over time. Inspect your tools at the start of the spring season, or at the end of fall, before you store them away for the winter. Tighten each loose bolt and screw you find to make sure everything is secure when you use the tool next.

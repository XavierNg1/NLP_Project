 At the bottom of the aluminum tube that holds the head on the tripod is a rubber cap. Once you have removed the cap lift the tube up and off the tripod.
 Well, the aluminum tube is composed of two lengths. Take apart the lengths by turning the little screw in the middle with the allen wrench., You'll have to loosen a nut that is hiding up inside the tube. At the base of the head there are two silver colored rings that look like they should come apart. Well they do and this nut is the secret. You'll need a ratchet, a socket of the right size,(13mm) and an extension to reach the length of the tube., They might be a little stuck so pry them if you must. Now you should have just the black head and the one silver ring to disassemble., They have gauges on them representing degrees of a circle. If they're important to you, remove them carefully without bending them., The two screws (allen) are holding plastic parts which in turn hold two of the three swiveling parts together; the base rotation (pan) and the side to side rotation. After the screws are unscrewed, remove all of the plastic parts (there are two additional plastic pieces that are kind of like gaskets)., Pull the two parts apart., You'll see that one side has ridges that line up with ridges on the support. At this point, the head should be apart. If you want to remove your handles at this point (not recommended) loosen them a lot, if necessary., You’ll have to work at this., Don't use WD40. Ask at your local hardware store for the best type., This is a little tricky, as there is a metal thing that sticks out and you have to kind of hold it back (it has a spring behind it) while you’re sliding in the tube.

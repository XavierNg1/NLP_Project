 To make your introduction as effective as possible you'll need to show the examiner that you understood the text. Make a simple and blunt comment on the style, genre, purpose or tone of the piece of writing. For example, "The biographical article about Nelson Mandela is written in a factual formal manner and mainly in an objective style." (this is a segment of a real A/A* essay by an anonymous student) You will also need to identify what the text is about and refer to the exam question: " the prose is continuous and focuses on Mandela's personal journey through life, exploring his physical hardships and mental hardships". This is a brief introduction that is effective because it uses sophisticated vocabulary and showcases the student's knowledge of the piece of writing. You may also want to use some punctuation marks such as ellipses (...), semi-colons (;), colons (:) or even a dash (-). The use of these throughout can boost your grade, just make sure that you use them correctly and that you're not going over the top.;

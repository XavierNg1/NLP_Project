 If a stain is giving you trouble with normal methods, apply a modest amount of vinegar with a soft rag or towel. Let it dry and then agitate with a suede brush. This can also be a good method for getting rid of salt lines.
 Brush steel wool vigorously against dry stains. However, be aware that this may require roughing up the rest of the shoe for an even look once the stain is removed.
 If you don't have a suede brush, agitate the suede with the emery board nail file, then steam it with a kettle or iron. The heat should help open up the pores of the suede and make cleaning easier.

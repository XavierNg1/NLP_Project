 Once you get to competition, what good is it if you don't know what your scores mean?

You don't need to work for as long as them, but certainly do some of the conditioning things they do.
 Are you a short, powerful Shawn Johnson or a long-lined, beautiful Nastia Liukin? This could help in determining what you'll be good at in gymnastics.
 Try some simple balances for beam. Hold up some handstands and hold splits for floor. Practice swinging from something - or maybe even just holding yourself up on a bar - for bars.

 Try to cut most fatty foods and fizzy drinks from your diet. Just eat healthily - you don't need to start worrying about specific dietary changes until you are level 8/9/10/Elite.

 This is at the base of the dishwasher and it's not called a trap without reason! This trap should be cleaned regularly to remove the trapped particles of food, grime, and even clumps of dishwasher detergents (especially the cake or powdered varieties).;
, Using a small scrubbing brush, clean off the soap scum residues. Dip the brush into white wine vinegar to help dissolve the scum. Don't forget to clean all of the sides, the racks, the cutlery holder, and the base and roof of the dishwasher. Also scrub the soap dispensers where a lot of residue will probably have accumulated. Stubborn soap can be removed using either citrus oil or eucalyptus oil on a damp cloth.
 Put it on the bottom level of the dishwasher and set the dishwasher for a short wash cycle.
, Your next load of dishes should come out sparkling with no residue.
 Once a month is ideal if you use the dishwasher every day; every three months if you use it less regularly.

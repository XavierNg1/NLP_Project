 When your baby can handle it, introduce nuts and seeds. Most pediatricians recommend waiting to introduce nuts until baby is 18 months old to reduce the risk of nut allergies. Speak with your pediatrician to determine when would be a good time to start your baby on them.
 Introduce plenty of iron-rich sources of chick peas, dark green vegetables, bread and iron-fortified cereals, into the diet. Add vitamin C sources to help the body absorb iron better.
 Remember that breast milk and formula are excellent sources of vitamin B12 for the first year of baby’s life.
 Selenium can be found in nuts, bagels, sunflower seeds, egg noodles and rice. Once given clearance by your pediatrician to start your baby on nuts, offer her some nut butters to avoid the risk of choking on whole nuts.
 Check labels for calcium enrichment. Many foods on the market today are fortified with calcium. Give your baby whole milk yogurt and cheeses.
 Because she will not be eating meats, she is likely to be hungrier more often than if she was not a vegetarian. Be sure to offer her plenty of snacks and meals throughout the day.
 Small tummies fill up quickly.
 Offer as much of the needed nutrients and calories as possible. Balance out the meal. Do not over-compensate with too much of one nutrient and not enough of another. A vegetarian diet, like any, requires a good balance of healthy nutrients.
 Using a combination of different foods at one time is an easy way to incorporate more of the beneficial nutrients that you are trying to provide for your baby.


Try serving multiple sources of nutritional foods such as rice with beans, bread with cheese and hummus with pita bread.
Don’t be afraid to think outside the box. Vegetarian diets have to be creative and it’s never too early to start your baby on a wide variety of foods.

 By late January of each year, you should receive a 1099-Div form from any institution that issued you any dividend payouts during the year.The 1099-Div is used to report several different types of dividend income. It is your responsibility as the taxpayer to read the form carefully and identify any mistakes. The 1099-Div reports the following types of income:Ordinary dividends
Capital gain distributions
Non-dividend distributions
Cash and noncash liquidation distributions
Exempt interest dividends;
, If you identify any errors on the 1099-Div that you receive, you must immediately notify the institution that sent it to you. If you notify the sender quickly enough, they may not have already submitted the incorrect form to the IRS, and you can save everyone some additional work.There is a window of time built in between the date that the institution sends you the 1099-Div and sends a copy to the IRS. If you identify the error during this window, then correcting the mistake will be easier.
 When you identify an error, regardless of the amount, you should tell the issuing institution to send you a corrected one. If the broker or customer service representative you speak to is unwilling to handle this, continue making calls and ask for a manager or supervisor.When you reach someone, say, “I received a 1099-Div form that is incorrect. The amount in Box One says I earned dividends of $5,000, but my records show that it should be 3,000.” Keep notes of your conversation.
The 1099-Div is submitted to the IRS and is used in calculating your taxes, so it must be accurate. An incorrect form or a discrepancy between the form submitted to the IRS and the information you report on your tax return can lead to an audit.
 You may receive a corrected 1099-Div form by your own request, or a corrected form may just arrive unexpectedly. In either case, you should study it carefully. Compare the information on the 1099-Div form to your own records., In most cases, the information on a 1099-Div form relates to income that you have received over the course of the year. Some of this income will be taxable, while some may not. Decide whether the information will result in a change in your taxes.The instructions that accompany the 1099-Div will tell you where to report the income on your 1040 or 1040A form. For some types of income, such as capital gains, you may need to do some additional work and complete additional forms to determine whether the income is taxable.
If you receive the corrected 1099-Div before you filed your tax return, then you are lucky. Simply use the corrected form instead of the original in preparing your tax return.
 Most states in the U.S. have their own income tax reporting requirements as well. A corrected 1099-Div may affect your state tax return as well as your federal return. When you receive the corrected 1099-Div, check your state tax return to determine whether any changes are necessary., A corrected 1099-Div does not automatically require you to file an amended tax return. You should file an amended tax return if the correction creates a significant change in your tax obligation or if it results in your being owed a refund. Some tax professionals recommend that you file an amended return to represent any change on a 1099-Div form.Nevertheless, the following are some reasons you might receive a corrected 1099-Div that would not require amending your tax return:If the correction was only to re-characterize the type of dividend but not the amount, then there may be no change to your tax obligation.
If the change is of a minimal amount ($10 or less), no amended return would be required.
 If you determine that you need to file an amended return because of a corrected 1099-Div, you will need to file Form 1040X. You can access a PDF copy of this form at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040x.pdf. You will be able to complete the form directly on the computer and then print a complete, typed form. Save a copy of the completed form for your records.
 When you complete Form 1040X, you will need to have your original filing, whether Form 1040 or 1040A, available. You will make references to the information that you filed originally and highlight any changes.In most cases, the changes caused by a corrected 1099-Div will be to your income. You will report changed income amounts on Line 1 and Line 5 of Form 1040X.
 In Part III of Form 1040X, you are asked to provide a brief explanation for the amendment. This is where you can explain that you received a corrected 1099-Div form. If possible, explain how and when the need for the correction arose and provide the dates that you received the 1099-Div.For example, you might say, “On January 20, 2016, I received a 1099-Div that reported $100,000 of dividend income. In fact, my dividend for the year was $10,000. I notified the issuer of this error, and I received a corrected 1099-Div on March 16, 2016. By then, I had already filed my Form 1040 tax return.”

, The corrected 1099-Div will come with multiple copies. One of these will be marked to send to the IRS. Attach that copy to your completed 1040X.You should receive an additional copy of the corrected 1099-Div for your state filing. If you determine that you need to file an amended state return, attach a copy to that as well.
 You may not file Form 1040X electronically. When the form is complete, print a paper copy of it and sign where indicated. Keep a copy for your records. Mail the completed Form 1040X, along with the copy of the corrected 1099-Div, to one of the following addresses:If you live in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi or Texas, send it to:

If you are claiming a refund, you must file the 1040X within three years of the date of your original 1040 or 1040A filling or two years after you paid the tax, whichever is later.

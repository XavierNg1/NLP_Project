 Bold and bright colors will really pop and complement your skin tone. Try jewel tones, such as turquoise, and emerald green. Pastels are another good choice and will make you stand out in a crowd. Avoid black and other deep tones.
 If you have a light or fair surface tone without freckles it is suggested that you try pastels. For example, pastel blue, mint green, periwinkle, baby pink, and heather gray will all complement your skin tone nicely. , If your skin tone is often described as olive you likely have a medium surface tone. You will look best wearing earth tones and metallics. For example, try gold, forest green, brown, mustard yellow, and cranberry red.

 This will give you access to a wide array of symbols, hearts, skulls, and much more. Simply open Character Map, and click on the desired symbol.


You can open character map on Windows XP, Windows 7 or Windows 8 by going to the start menu and looking under All Programs → Accessories → System Tools → Character Map.
 Click on the Character Viewer icon on the menubar, and pick a character set from the left-hand sidebar.


For example, pictographs contain the heart symbol in both black and white. Click on either, and a list of variations will appear on the right.
Right-click on the desired heart variation and copy to the clipboard.
Paste into Facebook, and delete the extra font information, leaving only the heart.
 This technique will work on most computers running Windows. Press and hold the Alt key. Next, click the 3 key on your number pad. The heart symbol will appear.
 For some computers, another combination will work. Press down Shift and Ins at the same time, which will make the ♥ symbol.

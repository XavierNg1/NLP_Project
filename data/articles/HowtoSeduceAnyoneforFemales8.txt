 A high pitched, loud voice will seem too immature. Don't talk too loud or fast. Instead, talk slowly and deliberately. Make sure though, that you don't let your voice be monotone., If swear words are part of your daily vocabulary, they lose their severity. Do not refrain completely though, use them at appropriate times only. Only use them to add to the conversation, not to hold it together. Cussing makes you seem rough and unapproachable.

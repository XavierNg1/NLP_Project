Try masks that have active carbon or charcoal in the filter to prevent you from breathing in most allergens, pollutants, smoke, and chemicals. You can also buy more specialized masks with a stronger P100 filter, those made for specifically for the effects of cold weather, or ones that help with respiration.You can also sign up for an alert system, such as EnviroFlash, which sends email alerts regarding the air quality in your area. With a bit of advance notice, you can either stay at home when the air quality is bad or be aware of the problem and wear a protective mask when you go outside., One of the best natural methods to support your lungs is to allow yourself to cough. Many people tend to use cough suppressants, but in most circumstances, you should not do this. Coughing is how your lungs get rid of the mucus in your lungs that has allergens or infection in it. Suppressing the cough allows the infected mucus and allergens to remain in your lungs.


Consider using a cough suppressant only if the coughing causes significant discomfort or if you cough so much that you canâ€™t catch your breath.

 Some hospitals offer birthing centers as part of their maternity care. You will still receive care from midwives and options for natural birth, but you will not require transportation to a different facility if an emergency occurs. You may simply be moved to a different ward., If you do not find a birth center inside of a hospital, you should look for one that has a partnership with a nearby hospital. This will ensure that if you need a transfer, the process will go smoothly. Check on a map to see how far apart the birth center is from its partnered hospital to ensure that the transfer would be fast. You should ask if their midwives have hospital admitting privileges at their partner hospital. If they have these privileges, your midwives will be able to accompany you from the center to the hospital., Before you decide on a birth center, ask if you can tour their facility. Make sure that it is accredited by the Commission for the Accreditation of Birth Centers and licensed by the state. As you walk around the facility, note its cleanliness. While there, you should ask them:


“Do your midwives have admittance privileges? If not, can the midwives still come with me if I have to be transferred to a hospital?”
“Do you have a physician on staff?”
“Do you accept insurance?”
“What happens if there is an emergency? How do transfers work here?”, If you want natural birth options in a safe facility, a birth center may be right for you. Check out what type of natural relief practices are available to you at your local birth center. At the same time, investigate how they use conventional medicine. Some common practices at birth centers include:


Water birth.
Birthing stools.Ability to walk during labor.
Birth balls.
The option to take a shower or a bath.

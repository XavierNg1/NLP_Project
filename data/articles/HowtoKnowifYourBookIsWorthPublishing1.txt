 One way to determine if your book is worth publishing is to consider who the book is for. Ask yourself, Who is my reader? Who will be interested in reading this book? These questions will help you identify the target audience for your book. Publishers often focus on a bookâ€™s target audience to help market it and sell it to readers.For example, perhaps you have a book that is about a love story during the American Civil War. You may then identify a target audience that enjoys historical fiction and romance.
You may also try to identify the demographics of your target audience, such as their age and gender. For example, a love story during the American Civil War may appeal more to women between the ages of 20-45.;
, You can also home in on the market for your book by comparing to other works that have been published in your genre. Go to your local bookstore and flip through books that are stocked in the same genre as your book. Read through them and compare your plot or approach to the approach of other writers. Think about how your book stacks up and whether it fits within a certain genre in the bookstore.For example, if you have a book that is for young adults, you may compare it to other books in the YA section of the bookstore. Look at how your book is the same or different from other YA books that have been published.
 You should think about what makes your book unique from the thousands of other titles that have already been published. Ask yourself, What makes my book unique? How does it stand out from other books? Finding out what makes your book unique and confirming it will stand out can help you decide it is worth publishing.Having a unique book in a genre can also make it more appealing to publishers, which could make it easier for you to get your book published. Some writers try to challenge themselves to write something unique in a particular genre so the resulting book stands out.

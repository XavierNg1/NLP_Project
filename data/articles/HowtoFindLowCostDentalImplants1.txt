 Pricing on dental implants can vary from dentist to dentist. Just as you would shop around for a quote on car repairs, you should also compare pricing between dentists to find the best rate. Talk to each dentist about the details of the procedure, including any necessary x-rays and CT scans, anesthesia, modeling, surgery, what kind of materials will be needed, and what other procedures may be involved. You should get a comprehensive breakdown and cost estimate for each part of the process.Your general dentist is not the only professional qualified to perform dental implant procedures. Periodontists and oral surgeons are also qualified. Gather pricing information from these types of practices as well.;
, Newer dental practices will often offer reduced pricing to bring in new patients. Contact some of the newer practices in your area and obtain price quotes from them as well.


Ensure you verify the credentials of newer practices since they probably don’t have many customer reviews from which to judge their ability., You may also want to consider getting your implant work done at a dental school. Many of these schools offer dental implant clinics in order to provide recent graduates the opportunity to gain hands-on experience performing dental implant surgery. The work is watched closely by instructors and other students so you will still receive high quality work, but at a fraction of the price.


Be aware that many schools of dentistry only offer this option to low-income individuals and there is often a waiting list.
In addition, you may need to go for multiple visits and the hours, which are usually during typical work hours, are often inconvenient., Many times, the cost of your procedure can increase because of the luxuries provided. While nice, these luxuries aren’t necessary. Check into clinics that focus solely on providing affordable dental work, skipping the unnecessary bells and whistles. Be sure, however, to make sure the clinic provides not only affordable, but high-quality work. Do some research to find testimonials from previous patients that have undergone similar procedures so you can see how their experiences have been., Personal recommendations are also a good way to find a dentist that can perform your implant for a reasonable price. Some dental offices even offer discounts on services to new referrals and those who have referred them. Check with your friends, family members, and co-workers to see if they’ve had any similar work done and if they can suggest a dentist who can perform the procedure at a reasonable rate.

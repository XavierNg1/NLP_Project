 There are two ways you can perform this exercise. You can do sets where you alternate back and forth between each leg after one rep. You can also do sets where you only do reps with the left leg, and then after completing a set, you can do a set with the right leg., Practicing single leg deadlifts can help improve your balance and flexibility. Start on one leg, your knee slightly bent. Bend forward at the hip as you lift the other leg behind you. Lower your abdomen as you lift your leg, keeping both straight. Stop when your body is parallel to the floor. In a controlled manner, lower your leg back to the floor as your raise your torso.
Repeat with the other leg.
 High knees help you get the last half of the touch and hop exercise. The jump and lift of your knee is similar to a high knee. To perform a high knee, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lift your right knee until it is at waist level and your thigh is parallel to the floor. Lower your foot to the floor and repeat with the left leg.The higher you lift your knee so your thigh is parallel to the floor, the better. If you arenâ€™t there yet, keep practicing and working on your flexibility.
To increase the intensity, jump as you alternate between lifting each leg.

 If you keep your office briefs on the last shelf of your bookshelf, move them to the highest shelf. Items that make good chew toys easily intrigue dogs, especially puppies. This, unfortunately, can lead to your client’s last will and testament being turned into an afternoon snack.
 Dogs like to chew and bare wood is especially appetizing for some, especially young puppies that are still learning the ropes. Office chairs with metal legs, for example, might be a better choice than your grandfather’s antique office chair., Both leather and microfiber are pet-friendly. Leather couches and chairs can be cleaned easily by simply wiping down the surface to remove pet hair. Microfiber furniture coverings can also be cleaned easily with a lint roller, and are designed to repel pet wetting., If your office has couches, chairs, or other furniture that Fluffy might find particularly intriguing for her afternoon nap, consider covering the upholstery with a budget-friendly and machine washable furniture cover. This will make removing pet hair a breeze and you won’t have to worry about your Rottweiler ruining your favorite recliner.

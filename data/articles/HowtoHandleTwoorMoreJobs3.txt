 There are lots of ways that you can work two jobs, but the ideal second job is something that you enjoy and will benefit from in the long run. Try to find a second job that allows you to indulge in one of your hobbies or that provides you with new skills that will make you more marketable in the future.

For example, if you love video games, then you might enjoy working at a retail video game store.
 Going straight from one job to the next can be depressing, so try to find a way to take a break before you go from one job to the next. The break does not have to be a long one to help ease the transition from one job to the next. Even a 30 minute break can help.For example, you could stop off at a favorite coffee shop and sit and enjoy a cup of coffee in the shop before heading to your next job.
 It can be difficult to manage two or more jobs, which may cause some people to try to do work for one job while they are on the clock for another job. However, this is a bad idea. Not only may doing work for one job while you are on the clock for another job get you into trouble, it will reduce your effectiveness.Stay focused on one job at a time to do the best work that you can at all of your jobs.

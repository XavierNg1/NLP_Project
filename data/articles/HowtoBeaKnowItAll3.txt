 You can be the office know-it-all by speaking up during meetings or group discussions. Be confident and assertive during meetings so everyone is aware of your presence. You may try raising your hand to speak or waiting for a lull in conversation to share your opinion. Being bold and honest about your thoughts is a key quality of being a know-it-all.Use “I” statements when you speak and try to go for a neutral tone, even if you are acting like a know-it-all. For example, you may say, “I think a better approach might be…” or “I believe we are missing a key issue, which is…”.
 As a know-it-all, you should also be willing to discuss your ideas with your coworkers in a clear and honest way. You may talk about your ideas casually over lunch or at the coffee machine. Or you may discuss your thoughts during a brainstorming meeting with coworkers.Try to maintain a friendly, neutral tone when you are sharing your ideas with your coworker, even if you feel they are the right ideas. For example, you may say, “I like your idea but I was also thinking about…” or “I see where you are going and I think adding on to that idea might make it stronger…”.
 You can be the ultimate know-it-all by focusing on doing well at your job and being a model employee. Meet your deadlines and keep your clients happy to show your boss that you are good at your job. You may also try to impress your clients with your ability to know-it-all and use this to your advantage as an employee.If you get feedback about your know-it-all attitude from your employer or your coworkers, you may want to consider how you can shift your attitude so you still project confidence and expertise without being too aggressive or in your face.

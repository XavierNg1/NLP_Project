Select F7:G1446 and, using Chart Wizard or the Ribbon, select Charts, All/Other, Scatter Smoothed Line Scatter. Copy or cut the small chart atop the data and activate the Chart worksheet and paste into cell A1. Hover over lower right corner until the cursor changes to a double arrowhead and then pull the sheet into an expanded version to about G54.
Using Chart Layout, get rid of both axes and both vertical and horizontal grid lines and the legend.

Done!

, Then activate the Data sheet and with the Shift Key depressed, do Copy Picture of A1:J8 and activate the Saves worksheet and do shift key + Paste Picture, or just do Copy and paste special formats, then values. The first way is easier a little because of the long note overflowing the column widths. Then activate the Chart worksheet and do shift key + Copy and Paste Picture into the Saves worksheet under the saved data. The reason for pasting the values also is because when formulas get pasted below this picture, they do not have the same references as when pasted at the top, so the results are different than on the the Data worksheet. But formulas still need to be preserved that have been altered, else it would be quite difficult to reconstruct images like this one years later.

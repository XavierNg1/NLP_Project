 It’s likely that you have some of your ex-boyfriend’s stuff at your house and some of your stuff at his. Arrange how you will return the stuff, hopefully without seeing one another. Try leaving it in the mailbox or giving it to a mutual friend to trade.
 In the digital age, it is hard to completely block contact with someone unless you unfriend (or unfollow) them on Facebook, unfollow them on Instagram and Twitter, and delete him on dating websites. If necessary, unfollow some of his friends, too, if they might post things about him that will bother you., You both need time to heal and get over the relationship on your own terms. Do not try to contact him, and do not let him contact you. Maybe you can be friends in the future, but you need time and space before either of you can decide to take steps to be friends again.

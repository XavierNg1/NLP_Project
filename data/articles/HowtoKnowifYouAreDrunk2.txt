 "Field Sobriety Tests" are tests that law enforcement uses to see if a suspect is drunk. They can be useful in figuring out whether or not you're drunk because they tend to be pretty accurate. NHTSA has determined that sober people can pass these tests in almost all cases, while about 80% of the people that are over the level of legal drunkenness in the USA (.08%) will fail. The "touch the nose" test is one of the easiest tests to try. Here is what you have to do:


Close your eyes and extend your arm all the way out.
Try to touch the end of your nose with your forefinger, while keeping your elbow extended straight out. If your elbow drops to your side, it doesn't count.
If you miss your nose, you are probably drunk.
 This tests sees if you can walk on a straight line, turn, and walk back. Here is what you have to do:


Find a straight line on the ground.
Walk six steps forward on the line, heel to toe. Then, turn on the heel, and walk six steps back.
You fail if you use your arms for balance, fall off the line, are unable to follow instructions, can't walk heel to toe.
 This test sees if you can stand with one leg slightly off the ground for 30 seconds. Here is what you should do:


Lift your leg about 6 inches (15cm) off of the ground.
Hold it there for about 30 seconds.
You fail if you do two or more of the following: swaying, putting the foot down, hopping, or using your arms to balance.

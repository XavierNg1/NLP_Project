 If you want to remove stains that have developed over a season or so (for example, after leaves have been collecting on your concrete throughout the fall), mix up a standard concrete cleaner using three parts baking soda and two parts bleach.The consistency of the paste should be like pea soup – thin enough to pour on your concrete but thick enough that it won’t just run off.;
, If you’re looking for a more environmentally-safe cleaner, try mixing up vinegar and baking soda. The exact amounts of vinegar to baking soda don’t matter as much as the consistency. It should have a paste-like consistency.Start by pouring some white distilled vinegar into a bucket or bowl and then slowly add baking soda. The mixture will foam up, so add the baking soda slowly so you it doesn't overflow. Give the bubbles some time to deflate so you can see what your consistency looks like before adding more baking soda., For smaller stained areas, you might want to try a vinegar, water, and salt solution that you can mix together in a spray bottle. This allows you to be more targeted in the application of the cleaner and prevents it from seeping to places you don’t want it to go – like flower beds or the lawn.


Use equal parts white distilled vinegar and warm water, then add a pinch or two of salt.Let this solution soak into your concrete for about twenty minutes.

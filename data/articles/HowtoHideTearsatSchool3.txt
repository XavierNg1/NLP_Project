 If you are sitting at your desk, place your head down between your folded arms so that no one can see your eyes. Say that you're tired or that your head hurts and you need a quick rest. Let out a few tears while you pretend that you are taking a rest.


Only do this if your teacher won't get upset; she may call on you and draw the attention of the whole class on you.
 Sometimes our voices tremble when we are sad, which will give away your tears. Try avoiding talking while you are sad.


If it is not possible to avoid talking, try talking in a lower tone of voice than you normally do and speak extra forcefully. Because you are sad you will probably sound more normal even though you think you are talking extra loud and deep.
 Find a reason to bend down, like dropping your pencil or getting something out of your backpack, and wipe your eyes with your shirt or a tissue if you have one on hand.
 If you don't have one but are able to go get one, find a tissue. You can pretend that you have to blow your nose, but before you do, discreetly wipe your eyes of their tears.


Try to turn away from others when you pretend to blow your nose; they will probably think you are just being polite being by not blowing your nose in their directions.
 Make it seem that you are trying to remove an eyelash or something else in your eye by blinking a lot or pulling your eyelid. While you are doing this, discreetly wipe away any tears that others may be able to see.
 Do your best fake sneeze into your hands or the inside of your elbow and wipe away any tears that way. If anyone sees any tears remaining and asks about them, you could jokingly say that you sneezed so hard you must have blown a gasket (i.e., you sneezed so hard it caused you to tear up).


If you know that you are prone to crying, consider packing some tissues in your bag for when you need them. Or, if you don't have a bag on you, put a few tissues in your pocket.

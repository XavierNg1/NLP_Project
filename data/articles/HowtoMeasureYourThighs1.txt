 You should use a flexible body tape measure, such as the type that a tailor would use. Do not use a retracting tape measure, like the ones used in construction or for measuring furniture. The tape should not stretch when pulled or bent.You can also use a string and a ruler. Wrap the string the same way you would a tape measure. Mark the length of the string used, and measure it against a ruler.;
, Stand with your legs straight. Find the thickest part of your thigh. This is your upper thigh, right under the buttocks. Start the tape at the front of your thigh and wrap it around towards the back before bringing it back to the front.Mark the number at the point where the tape measure meets itself., If you need to measure the length of your thigh, start the tape at the back of your knee and pull it straight up along the back of your thigh. Mark the measurement just where your buttocks begin. You may need to have a friend do this measurement for you., When measuring with a tape or string, the tape should press lightly against your skin, but you should not hold it so tightly that it sinks into your skin.

 Dietary treatment for colds should first start with determining whether the cold is caused by wind heat or wind cold. To determine the source of your cold, eat ginger.


If you experience excessive thirst, dry mouth, sore throat, and sweating after eating, then your cold is caused by wind heat.

To alleviate this type of cold, eat foods that have cooling properties such as cucumber and watermelon.


In case you are experiencing cold intolerance, the only way to counter that is by eating warm foods like garlic and curry.
Do not overeat. Chinese traditional medicine maintains that proper diet can restore balance to the body and boost your immune system.
 Your emotions play a key role in your overall health. Traditional Chinese medicine indicates that there are seven types of emotions that must be monitored and reduced, because they are factors that can aggravate an illness. These emotions include: anxiety, anger, fear, fright, overjoy, overthinking, and sadness.


Do a self-check every time you feel a surge of these emotions, because they can harm several organs in the body.
You can regulate your emotions by thinking positive, being optimistic, meditating, and listening to calming and soothing music.
 The type of exercise beneficial to reducing colds is mostly centered on doing slow, rhythmic exercises that require you to be mindful of your breathing. Exercise should focus on incorporating all the parts of the body.


A good exercise found in Chinese culture for this type of workout is tai-chi.

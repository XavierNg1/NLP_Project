 If you are stranded in the elevator with other people, ask if there is anyone with a medical issue or emergency. Check in with them to find out how they are doing and count how many people are in the car total. Be pleasant and calm. Explain that you have called for help and that it should be on it’s way. Most emergency personnel will respond within 20 minutes to an hour after being called to a stranded elevator.If there is anyone in the elevator who is stressed, anxious, or has a medical issue, try to keep them calm. Be polite and comforting to them. Stress that help is coming soon.
 To distract yourself from your situation, play games and talk to the others in the car. Introduce yourselves and chat about your day or yourselves to help ease the tension in the car. Play an icebreaker like “two truths and a lie,” where you reveal two truthful things and one lie, then have everyone guess the lie. Or you can play a game where you tell a story about the meaning behind your name.You can also try playing charades or guessing games to kill time while you wait for help in the elevator.
 Keep everyone's spirits up in the elevator and reassure them that emergency personnel are on their way to rescue everyone. Remind everyone that they will likely not be stranded in the elevator for very long and that help is on it's way. Try to keep everyone calm and discourage them from panicking.


For example, you may say, "Remember that help is on the way" or "Don't worry, we'll be out of the elevator in no time."

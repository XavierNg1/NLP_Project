 A good rule of thumb is to use one avocado for every person eating the dip.
 For every three avocados, use one fresh lime. Or, use a combination of fresh lemons or limes or, in a pinch, the equivalent juice from a substitute like Real Lime.
 You can add flavorings like chipotle pepper, cayenne, paprika, white pepper, and/or other seasoning (i.e. seasoned salt or non-salt mixture like Spike or Mrs. Dash). This is your chance to make the dip seasoned as you like it.


Some prefer it unflavoured, the avocados themselves being delicately and deliciously flavoured.
Optional other ingredients include: Fresh, sweet finely chopped onions, fresh finely chopped skinned and seeded tomatoes, or fresh cilantro leaves - any combination of these or other ingredients according to your taste. Try different combinations, play around.
 This is definitely the best way to do it, as it's mighty fresh. Have the other ingredients chopped and ready. Cut limes/lemons in half.


When all of the other ingredients are ready, peel the avocados and cut in half by using a sharp knife and going around the pit in a straight line. Take out the large center seed. (one way of removing the pit/seed, is to take a very sharp knife and rap the seed sharply with it, burying the knife just enough to be able to grab hold of and twist the seed, lifting it out.)







, Using a fork or a potato masher (the latter being much faster and easier), mash the avocados into a lumpy paste.
 Then season as desired (taste first before adding anything, and taste again after each addition). When it's the flavor you want, add the other fresh ingredients.

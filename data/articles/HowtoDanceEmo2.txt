 Either you can interlock your fingers together or you can clasp them together by forming the fingers in each hand into a claw shape and then cupping them together. Traditionally, this described as a hand gesture that people make when they are nervous or anxious., You donâ€™t need to bounce in any particular way. Just shift your weight to the balls of your feet and bounce up and down. Do this the same way that you would tap your knee or foot when you like a certain music and your body seems to automatically respond. Same here: bounce.


Remember that you should be feeling the music and moving in a carefree manner as you move in true emo fashion.
 If you have already leaned forward, move your torso back. Then, move it forward again, and continue to repeat this motion. The movement should be done energetically and intensely -- not without emotion or feeling. Some people appear to rocking back-and-forth almost violently when they do this.

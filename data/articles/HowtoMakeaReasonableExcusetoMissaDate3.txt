 When you cancel on someone you like, it's best to suggest a new time for you to meet. Unless you are trying to permanently distance yourself from your date, you should suggest the soonest possible opportunity to meet again.You might suggest trying again at the same time next week, or perhaps meeting the next day.
 If you cancel on someone, you may be privileging your needs over those of the other person, and you are certainly letting them down in a small way. Make excuses, but apologize as well.


Apologize by saying, "I'm so sorry to cancel. I hate to ask you to move your schedule around when we already had plans."
If you forgot a date, apologize profusely.
 An occasional small social lie can spare everyone's feelings, but generally it's best to not tell lies, especially with friends and loved ones. Little lies can lead to big lies. If you get caught doing something that isn't what you said you were up to, you'll lose the respect of the person you were supposed to meet., Lying only works if you keep it simple and believable. If you say you were with someone else, you risk them spilling the beans. Instead, tell a simple lie without many details.


Don't say, "Carly was feeling sad so I have to spend the day with her!"
Say, "I am not feeling good, so I'm going to stay home."

, If you cancel twice on a new acquaintance, you are unlikely to hear from them again. When you miss one appointment, make sure to make the next one for a time you can absolutely attend.
 Don't cancel the same day if you can avoid it. Give your friend or acquaintance time to make new plans. Never cancel after the person you are seeing is likely to have already started heading toward your meeting point.

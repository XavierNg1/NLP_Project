 Drinking plenty of water when you are ill is a must, but is especially helpful in clearing out chest congestion. Not drinking enough liquids will cause the mucus in your chest and throat to coagulate and thicken, making it stickier and harder to get rid of. Drink water (warm is preferable) throughout the day to thin out the mucus in your body.
 When you are sick your body is working very hard to kill your infection and this can significantly hamper electrolytes without restoring them.
 Hot liquids in general help to dissolve the mucus that causes chest congestion, but tea offers a double punch by adding in helpful herbs and spices that can ease chest pain and congestion. Brew up a cup of peppermint, ginger, chamomile, rosemary, or ginseng tea to drink several times a day. Add a bit of honey for sweetness and extra mucus-fighting power.
 Add a little saffron to a cup of milk. Stir and heat it up. Add a teaspoon of honey and a few drops of lemon juice. Drink while very hot and stir every few minutes.

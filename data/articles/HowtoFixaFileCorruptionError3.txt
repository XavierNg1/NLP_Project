 Check if it is just old problem caused by previous file or data corruption. If it is, you can copy over backup of data, reinstall software, or in worst case, erase and format system partition or entire hard drive and reinstall operating system and it should be fixed. Another possibility for source of your file or data corruption, some viruses are known to install system level drivers into your operating system, which is probably Windows, since most PC viruses are written for Windows and not other OSes. Sometimes these system level drivers can cause data corruption. If you think that may be the source of your problem, you should erase and format your hard drive and do fresh install of your operating system (probably Windows).

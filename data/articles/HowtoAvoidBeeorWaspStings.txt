 Bright floral colours attract bees and wasps.


Wear red. Insects cannot see red but are attracted to white and yellow.;
, Also avoid wearing perfume, cologne or aftershave. If you smell like a flower, the bee or wasp might think you are one.

 Wasps are attracted to food, so don't leave food or sweet drinks out.
 Stay calm and move with gentle gestures.
 Calmly walk away without making a fuss or waving your hands about. Commotion will attract the insect, especially if it is a wasp.
 Wasps are attracted to food and sweet drinks. Bees will quite happily land on a sugary cake or cookie at your picnic.


Keep outdoor food inside containers before eating and after eating; less yummy odors to attract the insects.
 The scent will attract the insects.
 If someone knocks on your door, you are likely to want to see who. If that person starts punching, tearing or kicking your house, you're likely to get angry. Wasps and bees are no different and they'll defend their home. Keep well away!


Wasp nests often look like papery constructions.
 The odor that is released will attract all of its buddies to defend (or avenge) and that is something nobody wants to bring down on themselves.

 Parents play a large role in shaping their children. You are not the only one who has a say in their personality, but you’ll be your child’s first teacher, protector, and friend. Think about what you need to do to mold your child into a person you (and your child) can be proud of.
 One way to choose a style is to refer back to what your parents did. For some people, thinking back to their own parenting is heart-warming, while for others it may cause trauma. Either way, most parents end up continuing the parenting cycle in some form, so take care in analyzing your family history. Consider asking your own parents about the techniques they used with you. Decide if you want to pass those experiences on to your own child., If you have a child or are expecting, chances are you already know a few people who have children of their own. Ask them about the strategies they use with their children.


Touch on key topics. Parenting is a large subject. You may want to come prepared with questions about specific topics like how to discipline, how much free time to allow, and how to split parenting responsibilities.

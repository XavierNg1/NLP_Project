 It is best to remove surface dirt from the paint before using the clay bar. The amount of dirt particles being picked up by the bar will be reduced, thereby allowing the bar to pick up more of the wax.
 You should use the clay bar on an area that is no bigger than 2x2 feet (61x61 centimeters). This way, you can focus on each area more thoroughly, leading to more even removal.
 Some clay bars come with clay lubricant, but sometimes, you may need to purchase it separately. A clay lubricant creates a smooth surface for the clay bar to pass over, making it easier for the clay to glide along the surface of the car without leaving pieces behind.The lubricant should be misted onto the paint evenly.
 Wipe from side to side or top to bottom, but apply a gentle pressure either way, allowing the clay to do the majority of the work. You may actually be able to hear the clay picking up wax and various contaminants. The clay bar will resist at first, but this is normal and acceptable as long as no clay is being left behind.


Continue sweeping the area until the clay bar no longer sticks. The wax is completely removed once the clay bar can slide across the surface without any resistance.
 If any clay pieces did break off and stick to the paint, spraying them with clay lubricant should make it easier to wipe them away., Remove any excess lubricant and clay particles with a clean terry cloth rag.
 Lightly rub the paint with your fingers. If it feels smooth, the clay bar did its job. If not, you may need to repeat the process once more, focusing on any areas that still feel rough.
 Continue working in 2x2 feet (61x61 centimeters) sections until all the wax has been stripped.

 The bases are the two parallel sides of the trapezoid. Let's call them sides a and b. Side a is 8 cm long and side b is 13 cm long.;
, Add 8 cm and 13 cm. 8 cm + 13 cm = 21 cm.
 The height of the trapezoid is perpendicular to the bases. In this example, the height of the trapezoid is 7 cm.
 The sum of the lengths of the bases is 21 cm and the height is 7 cm. 21 cm x 7 cm = 147 cm2.
 Divide 147 cm2 by 2 to get the final answer. 147 cm2/2 = 73.5 cm2. The area of the trapezoid is 73.5. You have just followed the formula for finding the area of a trapezoid, which is /2.

 When you make a to-do list, you keep yourself busy in the moment and give yourself things to do in the future. Keep your lists reasonable. Only add three to five items at a time to avoid getting overwhelmed. Once those are complete, you can make a new list., If you’ve finished up your work early, keep your momentum going by starting in on the next day’s tasks. Of course, this could leave you with even less to do tomorrow, but it keeps you busy for today and puts you ahead of the curve. If you are continuously ahead, you could talk to your boss about giving you more responsibilities., If you are having trouble staying busy at work, you may need more to do. Take on an extra project to fill in your free time. It might come with the added bonus of getting your boss’ attention., If your coworkers are a little behind, you can help them get caught up on their work. This will keep you busy and show that you are a team player. Your efforts will be respected and appreciated by your coworkers and your boss.

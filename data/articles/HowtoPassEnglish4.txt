Plan to meet at least once per week to study and quiz each other.


Try to team up with classmates who are good students. Studying with someone who is a good student will make it easier for you to excel in English class than studying with someone who is struggling.If you plan to study with a friend or group of friends, it can be easy to get distracted talking about other things. To prevent this from happening, try studying at the library. The quiet environment should make it easier for you and your study group to stay focused.

 You are always going to have ups and downs in your Spiritual Life, but your Ultimate Goal is to achieve Salvation.;
,, They almost hate him. But you can't hate something that doesn't exist, right? Remember that many atheists (such as Richard Dawkins) are incredibly hate-filled and bitter at God. This is what Satan wants. He wants everyone to turn against God, and these militant atheists are fulfilling his will.
 Many philosophers use this argument to argue the existence of God, and can be explained in 4 steps: 1) Everything that has a beginning of existence has a cause to it's existence. 2) The universe had a beginning because in nature, it is impossible to have an infinite past; infinity doesn't exist, and is just a man-made concept. 3) Therefore the universe has a cause. 4) We call this cause 'God'.
 There is so much in the Holy Book that concerns troubled faith, for example: Psalms 14:1 'The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.' Also, read John 20:29, 'Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."', and Hebrews 11, which talks about the importance of faith. http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11&version=NIV . There is so much more in the Bible - why not set aside a little time, each day to read the Bible?

, In fact, many might argue that it supports the evidence of a God. Read Dr William Lane Craig's response to the issue. ( source: http://www.reasonablefaith.org/disenchantment-with-atheism ) "What about the evolution of life and biological complexity? In fact, no one knows whether the origin of life and the evolution of biological complexity did not involve miraculous interventions of God along the way. Indeed, as I have emphasized elsewhere, no complete or compelling naturalistic account of the origin of life or of the mechanisms driving biological evolution or of the evolutionary history of the Earth is available. One might well regard the origin of life and the evolution of biological complexity as positive evidence for the involvement of God in the affairs of the universe. What is the point of evolution? Well, presumably to create an environment for human beings on this planet, complete with the fossil fuels necessary for the advancement of human life and civilization, in which persons can respond rationally and freely to God’s offer of salvation and eternal life. At what point does a life form first acquire a soul? I suppose at that point in evolutionary history when its neurological capacities have evolved to such an extent that is capable of serving as the physical mechanism through which the soul can function in accord with its capacities. These are, indeed, interesting questions, but hardly objections to theistic belief."

, You do not achieve salvation by getting the age of the earth right. Also, In the Bible, there is no mention of the age of the earth, let alone the importance of it in inheriting eternal life. What is a day for God, might be millions of years for us - It is not necessary for us to know.
 Remember that the suffering that occurs on this earth is irrelevant once you get into the Kingdom of Heaven. Martyn Lloyd-Jones once said: 'Let us not therefore be stumbled when we see surprising things happening in the world. Rather let us ask, ‘What is the relevance of this event to the kingdom of God?’ Or, if strange things are happening to you personally, don’t complain but say, ‘What is God teaching me through this?'

,, This is the part of God that we can see, hear, and experience for ourselves. It is present in every Christian in the world, and can be shown through simple actions such as prayer and by praising God as a community in a Church.
 There is always someone who can help - your Pastor, your Family, your Friends, even God can help if you Pray to him. The worst thing you can do is go through these struggles alone, and other Christian will always be willing to help.

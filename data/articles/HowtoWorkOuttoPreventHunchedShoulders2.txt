 Start by standing, and lean forward until your hands are on the ground and your hips in the air. Imagine your body is a straight line from your hips to your hands; this will help you lengthen your spine. Hold this pose for up to a minute., Lie face down on a stability ball while holding a dumbbell in each hand. Your legs should extend straight behind you, and your feet should be spaced slightly wider than your shoulders. When you start, your arms should be stretched out below your shoulders. Lift the dumbbells up to shoulder height, keeping your arms straight, before lowering them down again.Do two to three sets of ten reps.
 Set up a resistance band on a door or sturdy piece of furniture. Holding onto the ends of the band, move back a few feet. With your legs slightly bent and spine straight, start “rowing” with the band by pulling your elbows back behind your waist. Squeeze your shoulder blades, and return to starting position.Do two or three sets of 10-20 reps each, or two or three sets lasting 30-60 seconds.
You should continue until you begin to feel a burning sensation in the back of your shoulders and arms.
If this exercise is too difficult, you might try sitting on a chair while doing it.
The resistance band should be about waist height.
 At the gym, find a pull-down machine with a wide bar. Hold the bar with your chest slightly puffed out. As you exhale, pull the bar down until it almost touches your chest. After holding the pose for a second, slowly raise the bar back to starting position, inhaling as you do so.Start out doing one or two sets of 10-15 reps each. As you build strength and get more comfortable with the exercise, you can start gradually increasing your number of sets and/or reps, and adding more weight.
Before starting this exercise, adjust the seat to your height, and make sure that the correct weight is chosen.

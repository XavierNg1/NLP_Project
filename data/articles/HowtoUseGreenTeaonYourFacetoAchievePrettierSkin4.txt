 Boil some water and then pour it into a large bowl. Take a green teabag, cut it open, and empty the content into the hot water. Take a towel and place it over your head. Then bend over the bowl, making sure your face isn't very close to the water, but close enough to feel the steam. Stay under for only five minutes.

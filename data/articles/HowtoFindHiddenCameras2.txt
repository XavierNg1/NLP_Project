Use your purchased camera detector to perform a sweep of the room you are searching.
 Place a call to and then wave the device around a suspected item. Your phone will make clicking and buzzing noises near a product that emits an electromagnetic field.


Not all phones will do this, but if you've noticed that your phone tweedles or buzzes near speakers, or when a call is about to come in, it will work.
Dismantle the device. If you suspect a case of voyeurism or invasion of privacy by a stalker or predator, notify the authorities at once.
Work with the authorities to locate the video feed box. It will appear as a plain metal box that has cables running into it.
If you're the invader, sorryâ€”you're busted!

 Almost any teacher will go to extra help. Don’t be too proud to ask – you’ll develop a relationship with your teacher and it will help a lot. Your teacher will appreciate that you came in looking for more help and the teacher will know what you need to work on in the future. This is highly recommended.
 You have to be honest with yourself here. Is the issue that you aren’t trying hard enough, or that you really just don’t understand math? If you’re not trying hard enough, you need to work harder to practice on your own. There’s no way to understand math if you aren’t willing to put in the work. However, if you have been practicing on your own and you just can’t wrap your head around a certain subject, then it’s perfectly logical to ask for help.
 If you’re willing to spend money, hiring a professional tutor can be a huge help when it comes to understanding a subject. Professional tutors are often very expensive, but if you hire an older student the price might come down. Tutors will sit down with you one on one and work you through your problems.
 If you don’t want to hire a tutor or go to extra help another good option is to ask a peer. There is bound to be someone in the math class who understands the concepts well. Find this person and develop a relationship with them. Ask them if they would be willing to sit down with you over lunch and help you with a couple of topics you are struggling with. Don’t take advantage of them and never try to copy their answers – just use them as a resource. There’s no reason to be too proud to ask for help. That’s a good skill to develop in life.

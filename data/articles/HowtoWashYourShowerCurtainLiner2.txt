 Simply take it off, remove the big plastic cuffs, and put it in the washing machine. This method is more for surface stains, not removing mold.
 This will be used to "scrub" your liner. Again, this method is more to wipe up surface stains than do a deep cleaning.
 You won't need nearly as much as needed for a full load. A cup of white vinegar or a 1/3 cup of detergent should do.
 You can put it in the dryer, too, but only on cold and only for 4-5 minutes to get the big bits of water off.

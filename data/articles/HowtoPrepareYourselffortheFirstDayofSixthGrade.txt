 With this done, you won't waste time in the morning or feel rushed.


If your school doesn't have a uniform, choose an outfit that is clean, neat and suits your personality. Your friends may be helpful if you're uncertain what to choose.;
, You will probably already have a school stationery list; this should have been sorted by now. All you'll need to do is pack these things into your bag. Also add your bus/train pass (if you need it), your ID (if you have it yet), spare change, your cell phone (if allowed/have one), your contact numbers for emergencies, sanitary ware for girls, medication, etc.


Keep a kit for emergencies.
 Will you be making it or taking it? If making it, what can you make now and what needs to be made in the morning? Sandwiches need to be made just before you go, or else they'll go all soggy but cookies, a piece of fruit, a drink and some snacks can usually be packed the night before, in readiness. If buying lunch, ask your parents or guardians for the money now, to save rushing in the morning.
 If not, leave this until the next morning.
 It depends on what school you go to. It depends on what time you need to leave for school. Normally it is good to wake up an hour or two before school starts so you can be prepared if anything goes wrong.
, Try waffles/pancakes, cereal, oatmeal, toast and eggs, etc.
 Take some floss with you in case you get something stuck in your teeth during the day.
 Introduce yourself to new people; there may be some new friends you're yet to make!

, Get a file-case for organized papers.
 Or at least place a calendar or sticky notes at your locker to mark it.
 Sure, 6th grade is very similar to elementary, but the teachers are harder on turning in work so make sure you turn in your homework whenever you have it, and study for tests.
 You've started sixth grade at last!

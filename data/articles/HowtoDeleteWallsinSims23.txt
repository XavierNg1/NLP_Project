 While in build mode, find and select the "Walls" category. It should be clearly marked with a stylized wall-like icon.
 Once you are within the wall category, select the wall type of your choice. Depending on the expansion packs you have, there may be quite a few options.
 Be careful not to delete walls that you need â€“ they will cost money to fix!

, This will activate the wall-deletion function. When you hold Ctrl, you should be able to right-click and drag to remove sections of wall.
 While holding down the Ctrl key, right click and drag your mouse in the direction of the wall(s) that you want to delete. Do not release the clicker. The walls should disappear where you drag your cursor. When you're done deleting walls, release the Ctrl key and the right-mouse button.

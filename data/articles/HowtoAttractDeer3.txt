 Even the scent of a dog can frighten away deer.
 Deer prefer tall grass. So if you want a lot of deer in your yard, you could grow your grass longer. However, they also like a mixture of plant density.


Perhaps you could just grow the grass longer around the propertyâ€™s perimeter.
Deer enjoy a mixture of cleared areas, young trees and shrubs that provide cover and aid their diets and mature hardwood forests. They like to be on the edges of forests with a lot of different plants and densities. They often forage in clearings, especially at night, but they like to hide in the daylight in thicker foliage.
 If you have fences around your yard, deer may not be able to move around your property.


If removing a fence is not possible, you could create an opening within the fence for the deer to pass through.
Reduce bright lights and sounds. These things can scare deer, and make them stay away from your property. A lot of human activity on your property also might keep deer away.
 Deer will be drawn to certain trees and shrubs. If you plant them throughout your property, they will be a natural draw.


Blackberry trees, elderberry, juniper, red cedar, Douglas fir, and flowering dogwood are enjoyed by deer.
Plant flowering plants. Deer will like blooming plans and legumes. Pay attention to the edges of your property. Deer often hang out around the edges of properties especially if there is foliage that provides them cover.

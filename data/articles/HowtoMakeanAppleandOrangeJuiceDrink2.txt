 Cut the apples into segments. Remove any seeds from the segments and then dispose of the cores. Peel the oranges and then separate them into sections.If you're working with a weaker blender, cut your fruit into smaller pieces.
You do not need to peel the apples if you don't want to do so.
 If you're working with bigger fruit, add around 1/2 a cup of water. Bigger pieces of fruit will require around 3/4 a cup of water. As you probably want your juice cold, use colder water. You can use cold tap water or water stored in your fridge., Turn your blender to its highest setting. If you have a "liquify" setting, use this. Keep blending your juice until the mixture is smooth and liquid-like.How long this will take depends on the strength of your blenders. Stronger blenders will take a shorter period of time.
You're trying to create a puree texture rather than juice. Even a strong blender will not produce pure juice. Remember, you will be straining your mixture, so don't worry if there are still bits of pulp in your mix.
 Place a mesh strainer over a bowl big enough to hold all your juice. Pour your mixture into the strainer.Take a spatula. Gently press down on the mixture to squeeze out all the juice, while leaving the pulp in the strainer.
When you're done, throw away the pulp.
 If your juice is not as sweet as you want, add a few teaspoons of honey. However, remember honey contains a lot of sugar. If you're watching your sugar intake, skip the honey or only add a small amount.

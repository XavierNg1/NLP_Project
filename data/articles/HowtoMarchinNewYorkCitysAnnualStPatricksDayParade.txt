 Also you can find a friend or someone you know who is in an organization that marches and go with them.;
,,,,,,,, Obviously. It is a parade after all. There will always be people in the forefront so don't worry of not knowing where to go.
 Wave at the onlookers and march on the outside so you can give high fives to all the enthusiastic people in the crowds!

, Your pick will depend on your budget and the way you want to celebrate. If you want more of a frat kind of feel to drinking and being "Irish", go to the plethora of bars with cramped, jam-packed bodies and no room to breathe. If you want more of a classy way to celebrate, are hungry and have quite a bit more money, try going to a nice restaurant or steakhouse. I recommend: The Atlantic Grill, Smith & Wolensky's, and Rothman's. Any other restaurants you find you like, will do just fine. Just make sure to not go to an Italian or Chinese restaurant or anything with ethnic foods because, although those foods are extremely tasty as well, on this one day to celebrate Irish heritage, it would defeat the purpose. Go to a neutral place at best.
 Have at it! Don't forget to be responsible!Â ;)

 Bagels themselves lack protein altogether (along with other nutritional components including fiber and minerals). You can make up for this deficit by adding protein of your own. Lox (brined salmon) is a popular topping—typically layered on top of cream cheese and served with tomatoes and capers—and 3 ounces of lox contains 17 grams of protein.Focus on adding lean meats and non-fried protein to keep the fat content of the bagel low. While piling on the fried eggs and bacon will give your bagel protein, these foods will also increase calories and fats.
Rather than adding an entire egg, add only the egg whites for added protein without excessive calories., Don’t just smear on veggie-based cream cheese; top your bagel with cut or chopped vegetables to increase the fiber content and to add important vitamins and minerals that bagels themselves do not contain. If you’re scrambling some eggs (or egg whites) to put on your bagel, throw in some chopped bell peppers or chopped artichoke spears. Alternately, add a sliced tomato to the bagel.If you have enough time in the mornings as you prepare breakfast, consider roasting vegetables to add to your bagel. Roasting veggies draws out their naturally sweet flavors; try roasting sliced zucchini or eggplant to add flavor and texture to your bagel.
 Avocados are high in healthy fats and rich in flavor. Paired with dill and served on top of cream cheese, an avocado makes a delicious and filling topping for your morning bagel. First combine 1 Tbsp of chopped fresh dill with 2 Tbsp of a low-fat cream cheese or Greek yogurt. Mix these ingredients and spread on your bagel. Slice a ripe avocado, and place it on top of a toasted and smeared bagel.Sprinkle the bagel with salt and pepper to taste, and eat before it cools off.

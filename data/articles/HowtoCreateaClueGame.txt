, Print the room name on one side of the card, and print the name of the game on the other side.
 You can make up your own names for the characters, or choose to use the names of the suspects in the actual game.
 As with the names, you can substitute your own weapons instead of using the traditional clue weapons.
 If you don't have any fake money, you can just use pieces of paper to serve as money.
 For example, strong pieces of paper can serve as folders. Coordinate them with the names of the agents. For example, one agent could have a blue folder and be called 'Agent Marine'.
 At my store, I sell 'reference sheets'. The general reference sheets include the suspects, locations, and weapons. Players can purchase these to use while eliminating what's written on their card.
 Place them into an envelope. Evenly divide the remaining cards as well as the fake money. If you have any extra cards, as will sometimes happen, you can also sell these at your store.
 When asking questions to one another, have them go the the room in question. However, this is not required to play. The players agree to either exchange questions or they agree on a price for a question. Have fun playing!

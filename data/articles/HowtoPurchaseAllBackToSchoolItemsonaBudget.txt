, Contact the school or the teacher and ask whether there is a list of required or recommended items. While you're inquiring, learn about the dress code so that you can steer clear of clothes that would violate it.
 Do you have supplies from last year that you can reuse? What clothes still fit your kids, and what do they need more of? Can their shoes and jackets go another year, or even a few more months?

, When you're out shopping, stick to your list.
 Do enough comparison shopping to know what items normally cost.
 These tend to stock a wide range of back to school goods from pens and notebooks to clothes.
 Remember that children grow quickly, so allow space for growth.
 Choose one that will be robust enough for the wear and tear of school life, but avoid brand name products for better value. Alternatively, if your child doesn't generally lose his/her backpack, consider spending a bit extra once to get one with a lifetime warranty.
, If you buy something that is cheap and looks quite fragile, you will need to replace it sooner or later.
 That way, you can get that Juicy tote for $30, those Lucky jeans for $12, and that Abercrombie top for $7.

 Mac√©doine is actually a larger brunoise but the same method. In this case instead of making Julienne thin sticks, you are making them into larger sticks as per the Jardiniere.
From this stage, instead of making them into 2, 3 or 4cm batons, proceed as cutting the sticks into 1cm portions. The desired result is 1 x 1 x 1cm cubes.

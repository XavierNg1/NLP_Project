 If you love salads then you are probably already getting a lot of iron in your salad greens. A head of romaine lettuce is chock full of iron, and other greens such as spinach and parsley have good amounts of iron as well. Some individuals who are on raw food diets recommend making a smoothie out of your greens and getting much of your iron in this way. This is a delicious, easy and quick way to consume the iron that your body needs.
 There are certain vegetables that you can consume, which will make it easier to get all the iron you need.


Fennel and broccoli are very rich in iron, for example. These two vegetables can be easily incorporated into any dish. Broccoli is also beneficial to keep around as a snack and can be eaten often throughout the day.
Zucchini, also high in iron, is a versatile vegetable that can work well in a wide variety of meals. A popular way to eat zucchini when on a raw food diet is to shred it into spaghetti-like strands and top it with marinara sauce.
 Nuts are a very good source of many vitamins and nutrients that your body needs. In addition to being high in iron, they also contain a lot of protein and some have a lot of calcium as well. Sesame and sunflower seeds are especially high in iron and are a convenient snack option, as well as a quick and delicious topper for a salad. They can be easily tossed into a smoothie as well. Incorporate these nuts into your daily diet and you will be on your way to reaching your recommended daily amount of iron in no time.
 Men who are attempting to reach their daily amount of iron while on a raw food diet should have no problem. However, since women who are pre-menopausal need twice as much iron as men, it can be difficult to reach that recommended daily amount. For these women, it can be very helpful to take an iron supplement that is high quality in order to help you reach your daily intake goal.

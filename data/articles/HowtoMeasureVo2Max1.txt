 Many fitness trackers and watches come with a heart rate monitor. If you have one of these, record your heart rate while at rest (sitting down, doing little-to-no physical activity). The best time to measure your resting heart rate is in the morning before you get out of bed.To determine your heart rate without a monitor, place two fingers against the artery on the side of your neck, just under your jaw. You should be able to feel your heartbeat on your fingers.
Set a timer for 60 seconds and count the number of beats you feel. This is your resting heart rate in beats per minute (bpm).;
, The most common way to calculate your maximum heart rate is to subtract your age from 220.If you’re 25 years old, your HRmax = 220 -25 = 195 beats per minute (bpm).


There is some research that suggests this formula oversimplifies the calculation. You can also estimate your max heart rate with other formulas based on this research., The simplest formula to calculate VO2 max is VO2 max = 15 x (HRmax/HRrest). This method is considered to compare well with other common formulas.The units for VO2 max are milliliters per kilogram per minute (mL/kg/min).
 Using the resting and max heart rate you already determined, you can plug those values into the formula and calculate your VO2 max. Let’s say you’re resting heart rate is 80 bpm and your max heart rate is 195 bpm.


Write the formula: VO2 max = 15 x (HRmax/HRrest)
Plug in the values: VO2 max = 15 x (195/80).
Solve: VO2 max = 15 x 2.44 = 36.56 mL/kg/min.

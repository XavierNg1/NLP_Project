 Having a healthy diet is key to optimizing your blood flow.This is because, over time, a less healthy diet (containing, for instance, high amounts of processed foods, and one that is high in fat, sugar, and/or salt) can contribute to clogged arteries and overall diminished blood flow. On the other hand, you can improve the health of your arteries and your blood flow by incorporating healthy options like:


Vegetables
Lean meats
Whole grains
Healthy fats (such as those found naturally in avocado, fish oil, nuts and seeds).
 Spicy foods contain capsaicin from hot peppers in them. This chemical increases blood flow throughout the body. This is why many people become flushed when they eat certain spicy foods., Most experts recommend 8-12 cups of water per day, and more if and when you are exercising (to compensate for lost fluid during exertion). Consuming enough water is key to keeping your blood volume up, which in turn helps to improve circulation.


Also avoid too much caffeine and alcohol, as both contribute to dehydration.
However, if you notice swelling in your lower legs throughout the day, this is one indication not to consume too much fluid.If this is the case for you, speak to your doctor about appropriate fluid recommendations to maintain a healthy level of hydration. Keep in mind that there are many potential causes of swelling, so it is important to get a diagnosis and follow your doctor's recommendations.

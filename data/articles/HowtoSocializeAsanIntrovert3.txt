 As an introvert, you’re probably good at nurturing a few close friendships. Trying to be best friends with everybody will just tire you out. Choose your friends carefully, and don’t use up your social “juice” on people who don’t add value to your life.

Having a few good friends and a wide circle of casual acquaintances is a better strategy than trying to befriend everyone in your life.
 Sometimes a little bit of regular contact is all you need to keep a friendship going. Make it a priority to check in with your friends on a regular basis, even if that just means sending them a text or a funny video on Facebook. It’s much easier to maintain a friendship than it is to re-establish it after you haven’t talked for a while., Hosting a get-together or party lets you decide when and where the event happens. It also takes some of the social pressure off your shoulders – instead of sitting and talking, you can stay busy making sure everyone is comfortable and having a good time. Plus, your friends will appreciate your hospitality., One of the defining qualities of a close friendship is being able to share your personal thoughts and experiences with each other. Having quality conversations with your friends can keep your friendship going strong, even if you don’t spend time together frequently.Don’t rush into personal conversations with a friend you’ve just met – this might scare them off. Instead, let it happen naturally as you get to know each other better.

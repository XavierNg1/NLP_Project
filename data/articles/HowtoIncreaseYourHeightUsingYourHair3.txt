 The hair section should be centered so that it is surrounded by more hair on all sides. Lift this section and hold it up vertically. You can either leave your bangs down or include them in the bump by joining them together.
 If you don't have a teasing brush, a fine-tooth comb will do. Run the brush or comb from the middle of the hair two the roots two to three times. The brush should penetrate only the back half of the hair section to maintain a neat look., Push the teased section up slightly and pin it into place with a wide hair clip. If your hair is thick, you may need more than one clip. Once your hair is secure, run your fingers through the straight portion of the hair section to blend it with the rest of your hair., A variety of leave-in hair inserts are available as a shortcut to the hair bump. Just section your hair as in step one, place the insert towards the back of your crown, and layer your hair over the insert. You can also use them to make a bump towards the front of your head using only your bangs instead. The three major types of inserts are:


Velcro: The velcro insert resembles a dome. Place the flat side against the top of your head. The velcro will both hold the insert onto your head and the hair section over top to form the hair bump.Plastic: These crescent-shaped inserts are lined with teeth to hold hair in place. Position the curved part on the crown of your head like a head band. Many popular sets come with multiple sizes for different pouf heights.Foam: Sponge hair rollers take a little more skill to use than other inserts. They must be clipped into place sideways over the crown using bobby pins. Some teasing may be necessary for the draped hair section to hide the insert from view.

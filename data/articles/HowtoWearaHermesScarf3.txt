 This is a 1940s look that is excellent for bad hair days. Fold the scarf into a triangle. Put the middle point over your forehead, between your eyes, and tie the other two ends into a knot above it. Fold the point over toward the back of your head and tuck it into the knot. Secure it by tying the two ends into another knot, and tucking them into the sides of the scarf.
 If you have long hair, you can use your scarf as part of a side braid.


Fold the scarf in half lengthwise until it is about 2‚Äù wide. Put your hair over one shoulder and place the scarf at the top of your head, like a headband. Separate your hair into three parts, with each end of the scarf being added to the right and left section of hair.
Braid your hair, using the ends of the scarf to tie a knot at the end of your braid.
 Fold your scarf lengthwise a few times and put the center of it just above your hairline.Tie it at the nape of your neck. The knot should be under your hair.
 Fold the scarf diagonally into a triangle and place the center of the folded edge against your left hip at waist-height. Tie the scarf at your right side.


If desired, you can repeat with another scarf on the opposite side.
 Tie your scarf into a knot behind your neck, with the scarf hanging over your chest. Tie the remaining ends into another knot behind the small of your back. If you have an Hermes ring for your scarf, you can use it in a halter top. Put two adjacent corners through the ring, and tie those in a knot behind your neck, adjusting the ring as necessary. Knot the other two corners at the small of your back.

, This is not technically necessary, but it makes maneuvering the unwieldy club much easier.


Place rubber pads on the inside of your vice to give your club a little give when you are working. It is easy to accidentally bend your club if you have it locked firmly in a vice.
 Make sure you have enough room to work around the grip of the club.
 You will be using liquid solvent, so be careful how you drip.
, It should just peel back easily.
 You can also use lighter fluid or something similar, but specialized solvent is best. You want to get the solvent underneath the grip, between the shaft and the grip.
 You can use a straight razor here or just try to peel it off. Clean the shaft where the old grip and tape used to be.
 Peel off the backing of the second side. You can use professional golf grip tape, or tape you can pick up at any hardware store. Tape as far down the shaft as the new grip will extend.
 Try to cover the entire surface area.
 Stick a golf tee into the hole at the end of the grip to keep the fluid in.
 It will slip on easily because of the solvent. Pull out the golf tee that is in the end of the grip and force the grip all the way on. Do all this over a bucket or something to avoid a mess.
 Make sure you line up any graphics or logos to keep the grip from getting twisted.

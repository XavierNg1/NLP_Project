 Bring your upper arms to shoulder height and clasp your hands together.
 Look forward and raise your chin slightly, in order to keep a neutral, relaxed neck position. Press your hands firmly together until your upper and lower arms are flexed.
 Breathe throughout the exercise. Stop if your neck starts to get stiff or when you feel muscle fatigue.
 Work towards holding the position for 45 seconds for 2 to 3 repetitions.

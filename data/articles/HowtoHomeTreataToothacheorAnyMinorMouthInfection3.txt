 If your gums are slightly swollen and red or feel tender to the touch, try using a tartar-control toothpaste with fluoride in it. Tartar is hardened plaque on your teeth that can get into the gum line and cause gum disease.You should also use a mouthwash with fluoride and antimicrobial agents, which can help to reduce tiny lesions on the teeth (which increase the likelihood of tooth decay) and fight the bacteria in plaque that causes gum damage.
 Always brush after meals and snacks and floss every evening before bed. Mild gum disease is reversible with proper oral hygiene, so it's key that you make a concerted effort in this regard if you want to avoid developing the more severe periodontitis. If you're not sure if you're doing a thorough enough job of brushing your teeth, ask your dentist or dental hygienist for a lesson. Make sure as well to get regular checkups and teeth cleanings.If for whatever reason, you can't brush your teeth after you've eaten, try chewing a stick of sugar-free gum or using a toothpick to clean out any remaining food particles.
Another good option is to rinse your mouth out with warm salt water. Mix one teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water and then swish it around mouth. Don't swallow the solution; spit it out once you're done rinsing.
 Illegal drugs, like methamphetamines, can cause problems with your gums if you use them for a prolonged period of time. In addition, smoking tobacco is significantly associated with gum problems and reduces your body's ability to fight gum infections and slows the healing process.

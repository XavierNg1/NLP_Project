 If the intern works directly under you, you may want to have the person reassigned. The behaviors may bother you or cause you problems in your own tasks. If the person is contacting you for all reasons and all hours of the day, you may suggest that you do not work well together and find their behavior distracting.When making changes, you do not need to mention any feelings. Just make it a work matter that you do not work well together.
 If you feel harassed by the intern, don’t let it slide or continue to put up with it. If you feel the attention is unwanted and uncomfortable, speak up.Go to HR and talk about the harassment you’re experiencing. Ask about what steps to take next.
Keep in mind that the tables can be turned and the intern can report you for sexual harassment whether you respond to their advances or not.
 If the advances make you feel uncomfortable and/or are inappropriate in a workspace, make a report to human resources. Talk to the intern that you feel uncomfortable, the advances are not wanted, and you will take necessary action if they do not stop.Take to human resources on how to handle the situation. They may have some advice for you on how to handle it, who else to talk to, or how to reassign the intern.
You can also file a police report, if necessary.

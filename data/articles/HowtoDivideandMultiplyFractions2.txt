 Let's say you're dividing the fraction 1/2 by 18/20. Now, find the reciprocal of 18/20 which is 20/18 and change the division sign to a multiplication sign. So, 1/2 ÷ 18/20 = 1/2 x 20/18.
 Now, do the same thing you would do to multiply. If you multiply the numerators, 1 and 20, you get the result of 20 in the numerator. If you multiply the denominators, 2 and 18, you get 36 in the numerator. The product of the fractions is 20/36. 4 is the largest number that is evenly divisible by both the numerator and the denominator of this fraction, so divide each by 4 to get the simplified answer. 20/36 ÷ 4/4 = 5/9.

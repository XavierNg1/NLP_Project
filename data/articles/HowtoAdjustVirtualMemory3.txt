 Boot from live cd-it needs to have gparted on it.it should detect that you have linux installed and will use the swap space.
 this dismounts swap so you can increase the size of it.
 So in my case i have 4gb ram and 4gb swap. I need 8gb swap. So i reduce the partition next to swap by 4gb. the unallocated (greyed out) space should be next to the partition. (This may be done by booting through CD ROM and un-mounting the partitions). Now click on the partition (the bar at the top of gparted) and select resize. Include your unallocated space. click swapon-restart.

Warnings!!!
always have backups-not just when you are changing the system
-dont delete the swap partition- it is harder (at least for me) to create a new one so that everything works.

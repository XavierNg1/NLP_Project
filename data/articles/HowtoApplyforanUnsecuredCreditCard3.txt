 If you're really struggling at getting an unsecured credit card, then maybe it's best if you just use cash to make your purchases. Consider it an advantage because you'll be forcing yourself to live within your means. That kind of financial discipline will serve you well for your entire life.
 A debit card looks and feels like a credit card. However, there is one very noticeable difference: it immediately takes cash out of your checking account.


The primary benefit to using a debit card is that doesn't put you in debt and forces you to live within your means.
If your debit card is stolen, report the loss right away. Remember, if someone manages to use your debit card, they're stealing money from you.
 If your bank won't let you have a debit card attached to your checking account, then consider getting a prepaid debit card. That's a debit card secured by the money that you pay into it.


For example, if you put $2,000 into a prepaid debit card, then your spending limit on that card is $2,000. You won't incur any additional debt when you use a prepaid debit card because the money has already come out of your pocket.
Keep in mind, though, that prepaid debit cards often have fees. Be sure you look into the costs of a prepaid debit card before signing up for it.
 If you want to build credit but can't get an unsecured card, look into the possibility of getting a secured credit card. You'll have to put down some money (it can be as little as a few hundred dollars), but you can boost your credit score with proper management of a secured credit card.

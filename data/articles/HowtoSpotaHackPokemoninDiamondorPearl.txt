 100. If it is a hack, then the Pokémon's description may say, "Apparently had a fateful encounter at Lv. 100." It may also have a location where Pokémon cannot normally be captured, such as in the Pokémon League. The highest leveled wild Pokémon in either game is the wild Arceus, which is at level 80. The event for this Arceus has yet to occur.;
, Most hacks are shiny, but please note that it may not be. Shiny legendaries are easier to obtain without hacking, however, because players can save right before encountering the legendary and use a method known as 'soft resetting' for a shiny. Therefore, do not always assume that a shiny legendary is hacked either.
, High stats are fine, but if a Pokémon has a speed of 500, it is obviously a hack. Also look at a Pokémon's ability. Often, hackers will make their Pokémon's ability something like Wonder Guard, which prevents damage unless the move is super effective (and is exclusive to the Pokémon, Shedinja).

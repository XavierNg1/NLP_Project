 Add in some hair product to help manage your strands as youâ€™re braiding. The right product for you will depend on the texture of your hair. If you have fine and soft hair, spray a little bit of shine spray all over. If your hair is a bit thicker, wavy, and coarse, add in a small amount of cream or gel., Pull all of your hair back so it lays behind your shoulders and separate your hair into four equal sections: one section on each side and two equal sections in the back.It may be easier to remember the braiding pattern if you number the strands of hair 1, 2, 3, 4 from the left.
 With your four sections of hair separated, take your right hand and grab the second section of hair from the left, section 2. Cross it all the way over to the right, over the other two sections of hair, sections 3 and 4. Keep holding that section of hair, section 2, over to the right.


Take the remaining two sections on the left side of your head, sections 3 and 1, and twist them so section 3 twists over section 1, and section 3 is the new leftmost section of hair.
Mirror and repeat this process from the right side of your head: Take the second section of hair from the right, section 4, and cross it over the two left side sections of hair, sections 3 and 1. Keep holding section 4 all the way over to the left.
Take the remaining two sections of hair that are on the right side, section 1 and section 2, and twist them so section 1 twists over section 2.
As you braid, your hair will begin to look like rope. Keep braiding in this fashion until you reach the ends of your hair.
 Tie the end of your braid with a small elastic hair tie. Then finish the look by spritzing on some shine spray.If the section underneath the base of the braid starts to droop and sag down, slide some bobby pins underneath the braid to tidy up the look of the braid.

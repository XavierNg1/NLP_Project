 The garden soil must be gravelly, loamy, sandy-loam or sandy. Loam is soil that is loose and crumbly. Ice plants will not thrive in clay soil due to the fact that clay soil does not drain quickly.If your soil is clay, build a raised bed and fill it with sandy-loam soil for the ice plants or grow them in containers. Use sandy-loam soil or a potting mix formulated for cacti when growing ice plants in containers or raised beds. Sandy-loam soil is readily available in 10 or 20 pound bags at most garden centers.
 If the soil does not drain quickly enough, the ice plantâ€™s roots will rot, the leaves will turn yellow and drop and the entire plant will eventually die. If the leaves begin to turn yellow, carefully dig up the ice plant and check the roots.


If most of them are brown or black and mushy, the plant will not recover and should be thrown away.
If most of them are white, firm and healthy-looking, trim off the bad roots with sharp scissors and replant it. Let the soil dry out before watering the ice plant again. Root rot is the only disease ice plants are susceptible to but it is a very common cause of death in these plants.
 Plant them in a sunny garden or, if they are planted in containers, set them on a sunny patio or deck.


When ice plants do not get enough sunlight the leaves will become pale and they will bloom very little, if they bloom at all.
 Space plants 16 to 24 inches apart in the garden or in a window box to give the ice plants enough room to reach their mature width.A 10- to 12-inch diameter round or square container will comfortably hold one ice plant.

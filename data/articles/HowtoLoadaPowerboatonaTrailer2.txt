 If possible, have a helper ensure you are centered on the ramp and backing straight.
 The precise position depends on your boat, but this is a good starting point.
, Anticipate the direction of these forces and steer into them to offset their effects on the direction that your boat will travel with the idea towards landing squarely between the rails of your trailer.
, Drivers who are inexperienced at powerboat loading tend not to give the boat enough gas when driving onto a trailer. Don't be afraid to drive what feels to be a little too fast.
 Working as a team, the powerboat driver should slowly drive the boat forward while the assistant cranks the winch.

 The drain plug at the stern of the boat needs to be in when you are in the water, but excess water will drain out of the boat if you remove the plug before you drive away.
 Boat ramps can be slippery with moss and algae and it is important to not let the vehicle's tires spin. If your tow vehicle is equipped with four-wheel drive, this can be useful if your back tires start spinning.

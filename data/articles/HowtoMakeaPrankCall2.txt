 If you want to seek revenge on a classmate, then call the classmate's house and pretend to be the school principal. Make sure that one of the parents pick up. Here's how you do it:



Mrs. Smith: "Hello?"

You: "Hello, this is Mr. Jones, the principal at San Marcos High school. Am I speaking with Mrs. Smith?"

Mrs. Smith: "Yes. How can I help you?"

You: "This is about your son, Jeremy. I'm afraid to inform you that he's in big trouble here. He got into a fight with two boys and is on his way to my office. I'd like you to come here as soon as possible so we can discuss the matter."

Mrs. Smith: "My goodness! I'll be over there as soon as possible."

, If you have a friend who is particularly afraid of her parents and is worried that she'll get in trouble for almost anything, even getting home ten minutes past her curfew, then you should call her pretending that you're confirming pot delivery to her home. Here's how you do it:Kelley: "Hello?"

You: "Hey, is Kelley there?"

Kelley: "This is Kelley."

You: "Cool. I just wanted to confirm the weed delivery for tomorrow. Someone will be dropping by to deliver the goods at 6 pm."

Kelley: "What? I didn't call for any weed delivery. You must have the wrong person."

You: "This is Kelley Murray, right? You go to John P. Stevens High School?"

Kelley: "Yeah, but -- cancel the order. My parents will kill me."

You: "Just look out for a yellow Hummer. Someone will be there at 6 pm sharp. Goodbye."

, This is another great one. If you really want to annoy someone you know and to get them in big trouble with their parents, then you should call them posing as a random hookup of their daughter or son. Here's how you do it:



Mr. Wolf: "Hello?"

You: "Uh, hi. May I please speak to Mr. Wolf?"

Mr. Wolf: "Why yes, this is he. How can I help you?"

You: "So, um, this is kind of awkward, but I was in your daughter Marla's room two nights ago and I left my wallet behind."

Mr. Wolf: "You what?"

You: "Well, I was hooking up -- er, hanging out -- with your daughter, and I left my wallet in her room. I've been trying to call her for two days but she's been ignoring me, so I had to call the house. Sorry, sir, but I really do need my wallet."

Mr. Wolf: "How did you get in the house?"

You: "Oh, I did what all the guys do. I snuck in through the window."

Mr. Wolf: "You what?"

You: "I went through the window? Anyway, would you mind looking for the wallet for me, sir?"

Mr. Wolf: "And where might I find it?"

You: "Well, um, it should be at the bottom of the bed. Next to my boxers. Would you mind grabbing those too?"

, Let's say you and your friend went out to the bars the night before and he got so drunk that you know he won't remember what happened. This is the perfect opportunity to pretend to be a love interest that the person met at the bar and to make him really nervous.



Jake: "Hello?"

You: "You sound even sexier over the phone."

Jake: "Excuse me?"

You: "I said, you sound even sexier over the phone. I had so much fun with you last night."

Jake: "Who is this?"

You: "Don't play dumb with me."

Jake: "Uh...is this a joke?"

You: "This is Stacey. From Rick's cafe. We spent a lot of time in the bathroom having some fun? You told me I was the perfect girl for you right?"

Jake: "Uh, right...

You: "Don't be embarrassed. I know you love me. I think it's cute when men are so open like that. Anyway, it was so sweet of you to offer to go to the wedding with me today. You know how embarrassing it is when your plus one bails at the last minute, especially when it's your sister's wedding...my parents will feel so much better now."

Jake: "A wedding?"

You: "You're adorable. Listen, I'll be there to pick you up in an hour. I can't wait to see you."

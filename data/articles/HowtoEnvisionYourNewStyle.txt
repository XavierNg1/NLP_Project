 Read some magazines, watch your favorite shows, and read inspirational blogs. Are there people who inspire you? (Classmates, celebrities, etc.) Is there a specific time period you like? (80s, Victorian Gothic, etc.) Are there any styles that influence you now? (preppy, punk, etc.) Once you have an idea of what you want to look like, stick with it.;
, You can even make a fashion mood board or a Polyvore collage with clothing, colors, and inspirational pictures.
 What are the key elements that stand out in this look? Here are some examples: Scene kids have their cute plastic jewelry or colorful hair clips, punk kids love biker-style jackets or schoolgirl skirts, and almost everyone loves skinny jeans. Write a minimum of 5 key fashion items for your style. This should include apparel, shoes, makeup, jewelry, etc.
 These are the essentials or extras you don't already have. Here's an example: Doc Martens, stud leather satchel, and Lady Gaga hair bow. If you're on a budget, poke around the mall and internet to find your wants at lower prices. Shopping online is good as well, although buying accessories and jewelry over the internet is recommended over buying shoes and apparel (you can't really try on the clothes from your desk chair). Use all the coupon codes you can find.
, Organize them in piles or stacks in outfits, colors, clothing type, etc.
 Try them on, see what you would fix about each outfit, and rearrange the pieces accordingly.
 If they match your desired look, print them out and make a collage or two. Place the collage in your closet or next to your dresser, or somewhere you can see it (especially on a day when you're not sure what to wear).
 Get your hair done, watch some YouTube hair tutorials, etc. If you include makeup, the "basics" commonly include lipstick or gloss, foundation, at least one eyeshadow pallet with colors you love, and eyeliner (liquid is good, but you'll need steady hands).

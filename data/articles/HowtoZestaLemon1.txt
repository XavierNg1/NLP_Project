 Cleaning fruit is especially important when you plan on eating the peel. Scrub vigorously under hot, soap water with your fingers or a clean sponge.;
, A microplane produces a very fine zest, perfect for baking and cooking. If you don't have this tool, use the smallest holes on an ordinary grater. Position it as follows:


Microplane or flat grater: Hold the handle closest to you, with the end set against the cutting board at a 45ยบ angle. If the flat grater is unstable, grate over a bowl with the grater resting against the edge.
Box grater: Place it flat over the cutting board, with the finest side facing the hand holding the lemon. Push down on the handle to prevent sliding.
 Grate just enough to get through the yellow skin, avoiding the bitter white pith underneath. Many graters can pierce through this layer in a single movement. Be gentle if you are not using a microplane.


Graters will only grate in one direction. Microplanes can grate in either, but it's usually easier to push down, then lift the lemon back to the top.
 Once the white pith is exposed, rotate the lemon and zest the next strip of peel. Repeat until most of the peel is removed, or until you have enough zest for your recipe.


There's no need to get every bit from the ends or from flecks of remaining yellow.

 This is a crucial step in the process to being noticed. Make sure you aren't too shy or jumpy around her. This can be a major issue for some people who stutter or get nervous easily, but take your time. There's nothing to worry about.
 This is a very important part of the relationship, but DON'T hurry or overdo this. Girls who have just been friends up to this point will not commonly think of another girl as a potential date. So start some small talk and give her some hints and some things to think about. Talk about school or business/work. Strike up a conversation, or work in a group, or on a project with her. She will look at you in different ways as she gets to know you better.
 There are a few different types of hints you can drop. These are a more subtle start, with you showing interest in her first. Also not to be overdone. See the sections on verbal and non-verbal hints.
 Come right out and ask if she's ever considered herself bisexual or been interested in a bisexual experience.
 There will be letdowns in your life, don't let one disappointment interfere with the rest of your life. If you've tried everything with no results, it's simply time for you to move on to the next experience with the next person. No hard feelings - not every pair is a match.

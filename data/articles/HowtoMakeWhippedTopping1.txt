 Place a large glass or metal bowl in the refrigerator about an hour before making your whipped cream. Refrigerate a pair of metal beaters from a hand mixer as well. Keep your cream refrigerated right up until the moment you plan to make your whipped cream.Chilling the equipment before making the whipped cream will make it easier to incorporate air into the cream. This will make the whipped cream lighter and fluffier.
If you have a stand mixer, refrigerate the bowl and the whisk attachment.
You can use a whisk to whip cream, but it will take vigorous whipping and a lot of extra time. Refrigerate the whisk if that’s the tool you'll be working with.;
, When you're ready to make your whipped cream, remove the bowl, beaters or whisk, and cream from the fridge. Pour the cream into the chilled bowl, along with the vanilla, and the cinnamon or nutmeg if you like.


To sweeten the whipped cream, add 2 tablespoons (16 g) of powdered sugar to the bowl as well., Turn your stand or hand mixer to low speed and combine all the ingredients. Once the sugar and vanilla are incorporated into the cream, increase the speed to medium for about nine minutes, until stiff peaks begin to form.The stiff peak stage means that when you remove the whisk or beaters, the cream will hold its shape and won’t melt back into the bowl as a liquid would.
At the stiff peak stage, the whipped cream will have a slightly grainy texture.
 Whipped cream is great on pies, in hot chocolate, with ice cream, mixed with fruit, or even on breakfast dishes like pancakes and waffles.


To serve whipped cream, you can use a spoon to portion out dollops, or transfer the cream to a pastry bag and pipe it onto cakes and other baked goods.
Store leftovers in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap for up to a day.

 Old files and software will return and new files created after the restore date will be deleted.


A full system restore is only likely to be useful if you set up a Time Machine well in advance of needing your files restored.
 Open System Preferences and click “Time Machine.” Click “Select Backup Disk” and select the drive you want to use. You have two options:


You can use an external hard drive if you have one that can be connected via USB, Firewire, or Thunderbolt.
You can use OS X server or Apple Time Capsule on your network.
Click “Use Disk” to begin. The backup will start.
 Once the backup is complete, hold the Command Key + R while it restarts until the Apple logo appears. This will open the Mac’s Recovery System.

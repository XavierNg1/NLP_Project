 Use white eyeliner to color the entire eyelid. Apply the makeup as evenly as possible.The white eyeliner will have an impact on the way your eyeshadow appears. Furthermore, it should also act as a primer, allowing your eyeshadow to last longer as you go about your day.
 Pick a bright or dark color of eyeshadow. Brush the eyeshadow over the whitened portion of the eyelid, covering the area evenly with a fine dusting.


It's best to use a bright or dark eyeshadow for this. Muted colors would also work, but the effect won't be as dramatic since they inspire less contrast.
Leave the colors as they are or use a cotton swab to blend them together. The former will make the color of your eyeshadow pop, but the latter will fade the color of the eyeshadow and make it more subtle.

 Whisk 2 tsp (10 ml) of cornstarch into the milk as you heat it. The addition of a starch will prevent the milk from curdling and make it thicker in the process.


Cornstarch is generally preferred over flour.
You will need to add about 1 tsp (5 ml) of cornstarch or flour for every 1/2 cup (125 ml) milk to ensure that the milk will not curdle in the presence of an acidic ingredient or high heat.For best results, whisk cornstarch into the milk while the milk is still cold. Heat the milk up and add your other ingredients afterward.
 If you need to heat the milk, bring it up to temperature over low to medium-low heat and stir it frequently to disperse the heat throughout the liquid evenly.


Dairy milk and soy milk should not be cooked above a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius) if you do not want the milk to curdle.Monitor the temperature using a clip-on instant food thermometer. Attach the thermometer to the side of the pan. Make sure that the bulb touches the milk but not the bottom of the pan, since the temperature of the metal at the bottom of the pan will be hotter than the temperature of the milk.
 If you notice soy milk curdling when you add it to acidic coffee, try pouring your soy milk into the mug first before slowly pouring in the coffee. Add the coffee gradually to help temper the soy milk.In the case of coffee, it is also a good idea to let the coffee cool slightly before adding it to the soy milk. Doing so will make it even less likely that the coffee will curdle the milk.
Note that, while coffee is acidic, it is less acidic than vinegar or lemon juice. As a result, cool to lukewarm coffee is not likely to cause dairy milk or soy milk to curdle.
While dairy milk is less likely to curdle when poured into coffee, if you do have problems with dairy milk curdling in your coffee, you can use this same practice with dairy milk.

 If you are trying to introduce yourself to a girl that you don't know, you'll have to make eye contact with her first. Look at her direction and see if she reciprocates the eye contact. If she looks you in the eyes and smiles, it's usually a physical sign that she wants to talk to you.Girls who aren't with anyone or look bored may be more willing to talk to you.
 An introduction doesn't have to be elaborate, it just has to get a response. Simply say "Hi" and tell her your name. Then, you can ask her what her name is and ask her how her day is going.If she turns towards you, smiles, and talks, you'll know that the introduction is welcome.
 If you already have a relationship that you've built through chatting, you can go in for a hug when you first meet them. Make sure to read their body language. If they pull back or look uncomfortable, change the hug into a handshake., Continue to make conversation with the girl and ask her questions about herself. Be open, responsive, and truthful when talking about yourself. If the conversation flows well and feels natural, ask her for her contact information so you can talk to her later.

You can say something like, "Hey, so I'm about to get out of here but I really liked talking to you. Think I could get your number so we could chill in the future?"
Or you can say something like, "It was really good meeting you tonight. Let's exchange numbers so that we can hang out soon."

, If you've been watching a girl that you like from afar but haven't had the guts to go up to them and introduce yourself, your only working against yourself. The longer you wait, the more likely the situation will be awkward. Instead of fearing all the potential outcomes, just go up to the girl and introduce yourself.

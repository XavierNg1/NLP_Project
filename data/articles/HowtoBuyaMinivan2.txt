 Most minivans feature 7 seats, but a few models boast 8 or 9. Most minivans allow you to easily remove or fold down at least one row of seats, which is something to consider if you want extra cargo space and only need seating for 4 or 5 people.
 Some vans only have a sliding door on one side, while other newer models offer doors on both sides of the vehicle. Some minivans allow you to open the doors with the press of a button.
 Rear backup alert systems, traction control, and headlights that stay on in the day can all make it a bit easier to drive safely. You should also consider whether you need side air bags, or perhaps the kind that can sense whether there is a passenger in the seat. Make sure it has a rearview camera - rearward visibility in a minivan when reversing is minimal at best.

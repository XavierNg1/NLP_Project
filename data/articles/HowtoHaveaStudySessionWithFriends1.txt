 The ideal study group should have around 3-4 members, but no more than 5. Take some time to work out whom you would like to include. Think about your friends' personalities. (For example, your distracting, rebellious friend who hates homework might not be the best candidate.);
, Some good choices include a local library, a coffee shop, or at someone’s home. A home is probably the easiest place to get distracted and stray from your work, but a library requires you to be somewhat quiet. Although either of those choices are free of charge, whereas working at coffee shop costs some money. Think about what resources (like internet or access to art supplies) you need and which place can best accommodate you.Many libraries have study rooms that allow talking and large groups, so check with your library beforehand.
 Set up a regular session at a time that works for everyone. You can use an online platform like GatherGrid or Doodle to compare everyone’s schedules and find a time that works best.


You may want to consider meeting more than once. If possible, plan to meet at least once a week.
 If you want your study group to be effective, it is important for all of the members to make a commitment to the group. This means showing up on time, ready to work; as well as completing any prep work necessary before the meeting time. If all of your friends are on the same page, your group will do a great job studying together., It is a really good idea to select one group leader or facilitator. This could be one specific person, or group members can take turns. This person is in charge of keeping everyone on track, so that you don’t waste valuable time. Additionally, this person could send out an email or text reminding everyone about the approaching session.

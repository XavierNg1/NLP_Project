 The wooden or the plastic varieties are both fine. They should be about 4 inches (10.2Â cm) in length.;
, Whenever you open the cage door to handle your canary or to clean the cage, have the clothespins handy to keep the cage door open.
 Clothespins can hold the canaries' greens (leaves, stalks etc.) from the top of the cage. You can reposition the food as often as needed to improve ease of access for your canary.
 A good possibility is to use a clothespin as a perch. Ensure that the clothespin is secure and straight and placed in a good position for the canaries to perch on. Vary the perching areas in the cage by changing the perching position regularly. This is easily done by simply unclasping and shifting the clothespin!

, This will ensure they do not build up bacteria etc. that might harm your canaries. As clothespins are not that expensive, discard when the clothespin is beyond cleaning and use other ones.
 And then leave your ideas here!

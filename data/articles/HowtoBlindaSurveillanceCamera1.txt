 The brighter the flashlight, the better. Use a small device that you can easily store. This method only works well in the dark, so save it for stealthy excursions at night or in enclosed spaces., Figure out exactly where the camera is, and shine the light directly into the lens. When properly executed, this technique should create a lens flare that makes it nearly impossible to tell what you look like.Be warned that the flashlight method is not subtle. The sudden flash of will alert any vigilant guard to your presence. However, you should at least be able to use the bright light to obscure your face.
 Be careful not to drop the light beam from the camera lens, lest you reveal your face. Make sure not to shine the light onto your face. Remember: this method only works if you are quick and precise.
 For a quick fix, superglue a string of bright lights to a hat or headband.If you wish to get more involved, you can craft an LED "mask" that even more heavily obscures your face. Make sure that the lights are bright enough to blot out your face from the camera's view, but not so bright that they blind you!

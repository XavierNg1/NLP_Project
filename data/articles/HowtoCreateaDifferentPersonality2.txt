 Avoid setting vague goals such as, “I’m going to change.” This sets you up for failure, since you have no way to measure the success that you’ve had. Instead, set a goal that is specific enough to know when you’ve accomplished it.For example, you might have a goal like, “I am going to act in a more extroverted way for a month.”

, Once you have a goal, you need a path to reach it. This path should be made of actionable steps. Write these plans or steps down so you can keep track of your progress, what works for you and what doesn't work as you go along. These steps are things that you can actually do, not just plan.For example, if your goal is to be more extroverted for a month, you might make steps like, “I will talk to two new people at work and go to one party this month.”

, Once you start working on your new personality, you’ll want to know how effective the changes are. You should track each specific goal by keeping record of your actionable steps and their outcomes. You can also track your overall progress by re-evaluating where your new personality falls on the big five personality traits.For example, you could mark on a calendar each time you attend a social event or talk to a new person. This will let you keep track of how well you are doing at being more extroverted.
Another option is to keep a journal of all of your goals. Such as, those goals that you have achieved, and those that you are continuing to work towards. Detail the steps that you are making to achieve those goals, and those specific experiences, people, or things, that help you stay accountable and on track.
 Even if progress is slow, you should keep a positive attitude about your goals. To do this, you have to celebrate little victories. You shouldn’t give up just because you weren’t the life of the party in the first month. Instead, give yourself credit for having gone to the party in the first place.

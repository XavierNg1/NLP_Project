, One way to do this is to get about 20 cinder blocks and arrange them in a square, two layers deep. Then line the inside of the pit with a heavy duty tarp.
 Fill a jar (or plastic bottle - make sure it's see-through) halfway with the soil sample. Fill it the rest of the way with water. Shake vigorously for about a minute, then let it sit overnight. The next day, the soil will have settled into distinct bands. The bottom of the jar will have the larger-sized materials - sand and small pebbles - with smaller and smaller sized particles banding towards the top. The top band will be the clay or different silt. Ideally, the three bands will be about the same size. If your sample has more than a third sand (the bottom layer), you may not need to add any sand to your adobe.

Determine the height of the wall in feet.
Since bricks (and thus the wall) are made 10" (25.5 cm) thick, multiply the length by height by 0.83 (10 in = .83 ft).
Divide that by 27. This is the total volume in cubic yards of the wall.
 Sand is usually sold by the ton - you can calculate tonnage by multiplying your volume by .83. The sand should be relatively fine sand - beach sand or slightly larger works fine. NOTE: The amount of sand you mix in is very dependent upon the clay you have available, your climate, and how strong you want the wall. It's entirely relative - and there's really no wrong way to do this.
Clay (about a third of your total volume). Again, clay or fill dirt is usually sold by the ton. Multiply your volume by .9 if it is dry, .7 if it is wet.
Straw (about 10 - 20% of your total volume). Straw is sold in bales of various sizes. The most common "big" bales are 14"x18"x36" (35.5 centimeter (14.0 in) x 45.7 centimeter (18.0 in) x 91.4 centimeter (36.0 in), which is .15 cubic yards. So multiply your total volume by .015 to get the number of "big" bales you'll need.
 A typical form is made using two 2x4 studs, which are 96" long. Note that a typical stud is actually 1.5" (3.8 cm) by 3.5" (8.8 cm), which is why the lengths are odd (25.5", for example).

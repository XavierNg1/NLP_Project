 As the yoyo slows down, it should eventually begin to reel up the string—but you may need to help it along. Gently tug the yoyo up with your hand. Make sure that you pull up before the yoyo stops spinning, otherwise it won't come back!

, Let the yoyo return to your middle finger, then grasp it with your palm. It is important that you learn to finish the trick smoothly—if you "stick the landing," your audience will be even more impressed.
 You may not get the trick down on the first try, but you can work on the technique until you master it. Make sure that you don't practice around anyone or anything that could get hurt/broken; try not to swing your yoyo around people or objects until you are confident in your ability to control the yoyo.

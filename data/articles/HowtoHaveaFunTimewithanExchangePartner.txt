 Email them at least four weeks in advance. Discuss hobbies, family members, their likes and dislikes. The more you get to know about them, the easier the conversation will be once they arrive.;
, Depending on whether they share your room or not, make their lodgings very comfortable. Change the sheets and put out fresh towels. It would be nice to place fresh flowers in the room to make them feel really welcome. You could put up posters and pictures, to brighten up a dull room.
 Have the family all join in the conversation, as your parents would like to get to know them and are as excited as you are. Offer them something to eat or a drink, and help them to unpack and make themselves comfortable.
 Give them a tour of your town. Ask them if they have anything special that they would like to do or see.
 Buy them a little goodbye gift so they will remember the visit.

 The first step for any pilot is to get their Private Pilot Licence. This is considered the first step because it is the basic pilot licence that everyone must get. This licence allows you to fly, but it doesn't allow you to be paid to fly. This licence can be finished in as quickly as 2-3 months, depending on your skill and dedication.;
, This is the next licence after the Private Pilot Licence. It allows you to start working as a professional pilot. This licence requires 200-250 hours of flying hours before you are eligible to write the exam. When you get this licence, you will begin working entry level pilot jobs.
 This is not a required step to become a professional pilot. However, it is very beneficial for your pilot career if you have a degree. The most important thing for pilots is their licensing and flying experience. However, a university degree will help you stand out from other applicants. As with all careers in the world, the more educated applicant is given preference. In fact, airlines are known to give preference to applicants with a university degree. Remember, that it does not matter what you study, or what kind of degree you have. You do not necessarily have to have an aviation or science degree. The important thing is that you have further education.
 This is the highest level of licensing for a pilot. It allows you work as Captain on regional and major airlines. All major pilot jobs require this licence. It will require you a minimum of 1500 hours flying experience to be eligible to write this 2 part written exam. These hours will be built up by working as a pilot after getting your Commercial Pilot Licence.

 From the apps drawer or home screen, look for Google Play Store’s icon, which looks like a shopping bag sporting a colored Play button, and tap on it.;
, Do so by typing “SoundHound” in Google Play Store’s search bar, which is a text field that says “Search Google Play” found at the upper right section of the screen. Afterwards, tap on the magnifying-glass icon to launch the search.
 You will see SoundHound at the top of this list. Just tap on it to select it.
 Tap on the green “Install” button on the right side of the SoundHound app page. A small pop-up window will then appear asking you to grant the app all the necessary permissions for it to run. Tap on the “Accept” button if you are amenable.


Wait more or less one minute for SoundHound to download and be automatically installed. A “Successfully installed” message will then appear on your screen once SoundHound is ready. The app icon will then show both on your device’s home screen and apps menu.
 Tap on SoundHound’s app icon either from the home screen or app drawer to launch and open the app interface.


To use SoundHound, make sure your Internet data or Wi-Fi connection is switched on.
 Once SoundHound is open, an orange rectangular button with “What’s That Song?” and “Tap Here” written on it will appear on your Android screen. Tap on it.
 Once you see “Listening” displayed on your device’s screen, it means SoundHound can now detect sound and is ready to identify music. Hold your Android device towards the music or song you want to identify. Within seconds, you will see the name of the track, its singer, movie/album, and other such information on your Android screen.


If SoundHound fails to recognize the song and comes back with an error message, just click on the orange “Search Again” button. It might help if you get closer to the source of the music.






If you happen to suddenly remember lines to a song, you can belt it out, and there is a big chance SoundHound will recognize it.

 Always consult your vet regarding your puppy’s exercise needs and the best methods to fulfill these needs, first. The amount and type of exercise your puppy needs depends on its breed and size.


Ask your vet, "I would like to know what the exercise protocols are for my puppy. When should I begin exercising my puppy, and what exercises do you recommend?"

, Do not take your puppy for long, strenuous walks. Instead, take your puppy for short, informal walks. Allow your puppy time to sniff and explore as you walk. It is recommended that a puppy have no more than five minutes of walking for every month of its age.For example, if your puppy is three months old, then a 15 minute walk is sufficient.
Puppies under three months of age do not need to be walked, especially if they have not been vaccinated.
Stop the walk immediately if you notice signs of over exertion such as stopping, lying down, lagging behind, and/or panting.
 Activities like climbing stairs, long and face paced walks, hiking, playing fetch, jogging or running, and frisbee throwing should be avoided. These activities are strenuous activities that put stress on your puppy’s developing bones and muscles.Stress on your puppy’s bones and muscles at an early age can cause diseases such as hip dysplasia as your puppy gets older.
Tug-of-war type games can harm your puppy's small teeth.

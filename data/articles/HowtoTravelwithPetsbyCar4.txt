 The type of fish will impact the way in which you carry it by car.


If the fish are tropical, they probably need to stay warm, at slightly above room temperature.



If the fish tend to be aggressive, consider separating them for the trip.



If the size of the tank is small, such as 1-10 gallons, then minimal work will be required to transport it.
If the size of the tank exceeds 15 gallons, or even 20 gallons, consider asking someone to assist you in moving it.
The larger the tank size, the longer it will take to change the temperature. If you have a small tank, make sure that you can control the temperature to ensure your fish aren't overwhelmed by the change in temperature.

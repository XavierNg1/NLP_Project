 If you truly feel you were taken advantage of in the situation, consider leaving a review online on the restaurant’s Google or Yelp page. Say, “I went to this restaurant hoping to experience a lovely evening, but instead waited over an hour for cold food from a waiter who didn't even apologize." Spreading the news of a rude occurrence is important for preventing other people from experiencing the same thing.


Explain in your review how you attempted to remedy the situation. For example, say “I asked the waiter to clarify what he said, but he continued to be rude.” This will help to convince readers that you were still treated unfairly despite your attempt to work with the waiter.
Understand that writing a bad restaurant review has its consequences. Many times these reviews become part of the restaurant's permanent reputation. People may lose their jobs if the story is bad enough.Follow a restaurant critic’s code of ethics. Many professional restaurant critics wait until they have visited a location multiple times before writing a review. The reviewer is then able to judge whether poor customer service is frequent at that particular restaurant. If you feel as though you truly had a negative experience that others need to hear before they spend their money, then go ahead with posting your review., Read reviews online on Google’s restaurant reviews before going to future restaurants. Ask friends and family what their opinion of the place is. You can also look up the restaurant on Facebook or on other social media sites to see read further reviews and comments.
 Take a deep breath and count to 10. Ask yourself "Is it worth my time to get upset over this?" If you’ve done everything you can do, it’s time to move on.


Experiencing rude people is a part of life. Choose to spread positivism instead!

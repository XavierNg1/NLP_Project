 This method works if you don't want to hurt his feelings and you don't know how to explain it to him. However, it's slower and might be less effective.
 For example, if he hates MTV, make sure he hears you talking about how awesome it is. If he likes My Chemical Romance, make sure he hears you talking about how much they suck and how you love Ashlee Simpson. Eventually, he'll realize you have nothing in common.
 Not to him. It might be a little harsh, but it's nicely saying that you're interested in someone else. He might give up.
 If he hangs around the local coffee shop on weekends, go somewhere else then. However, for example, if you regularly hang out there on weekends too, don't stop going there instantly. Just make a few excuses for why you can't go there that weekend and only go there once in a while. When you're gone, he might notice someone else.
 Continue to talk to him, if you already do. Just make sure you're not sending any flirting vibes. Try not to look him directly in the eye, don't touch his knee or anything when he makes a joke, and don't giggle at everything he says. If you talk to him exactly the same way you do your little brother, he might give up.
 It's not worth it continuing to be subtle if he just doesn't get it.

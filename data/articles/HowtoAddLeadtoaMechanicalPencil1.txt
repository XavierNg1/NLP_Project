 Exact instructions may vary by model, but generally, start by pulling the eraser out of the pencil, which will draw out the old cassette. Give the old cassette a shake just to make sure that it really is empty. If so, insert a new cassette into the pencil’s open chamber. Once it clicks into place, reinsert the eraser after detaching the old cassette., If your pencil doesn't use cassettes, try pulling the eraser out of the pencil. If it reveals the pencil's chamber when removed, feed the recommended number of lead pieces into the pencil’s chamber. Fit the eraser back into place when finished., If the eraser isn't removable or doesn't offer access to the chamber, load it from the bottom instead. First, depress the eraser end and hold it in place. Fit the first piece of lead into the tip’s hole. Gently push it all the way inside the pencil. Repeat with each piece of lead until you fill your pencil.


Note that some pencils advance lead out of the chamber by clicking a button on the side instead of the eraser.

 If you have dry milk powder, you can make evaporated milk by mixing it with roughly 40% as much water as the label instructions suggest. To make the equivalent of one 12-oz can of evaporated milk, bring 1Â¼ cup (300mL) water to a simmer. The heat will add a slight caramel flavor characteristic of evaporated milk.
 Optionally, add 1 tbsp (15g) butter for a creamier taste.Add 2 tbsp (30g) for an extra rich evaporated milk, or up to 8 tbsp (115g) if you are using a skim milk powder and want to use the final result as a cream replacement.
 Add 1 cup (240mL) instant dry milk powder and continue stirring until it has dissolved completely.
 This mixture is already roughly as concentrated as evaporated milk, so you could use it right away. If you prefer a more caramel taste or a thicker consistency, cook at a simmer for five or ten minutes, stirring frequently.

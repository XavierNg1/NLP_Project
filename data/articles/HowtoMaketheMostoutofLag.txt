 It's pretty obvious when you get lag, are your shots not registering on an enemy player (no matter how much you shoot at him, he just won't die), do die for appertain no reason or do your grenades simply disappear when you swore you threw them, these are good indicators that you have severe lag.


But first: how to find out if you have lag without directly engaging the enemy-;
, If it explodes about a second after hitting the ground (keep in mind that plasma grenades have a 3 sec fuse) then your connection should be fine.



If the timer, however, simply freezes, this means you have severe lag, i suggest you find a good hiding now.



For all you know, your enemies just see you as this freaky guy teleporting from place to place, you can use this to your advantage sometimes.
If enemy units just seem to be standing there, doing nothing at all, then chances are they have blackscreened (this is when a player dies and does not respawn for some time, this doesn't mean you can't kill them though, feel free to step and and score some easy kills.
If you are the one lagging, you can still help your team. Don't rush the enemy head on but fall back and provide support.

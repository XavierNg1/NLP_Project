 Using an old rag balled up, plug the hole, as you will want to prevent gases from rising into your home and keep tools from disappearing into the floor! Just remember to remove this rag when you put the new toilet in place.
 Pull the old bolts out of the flange (you will probably need to pull them to the side a little, as are placed like a nail hanging a picture frame). Dispose of the old bolts in an appropriate manner.
 Remove everything that remains of the old wax seal. You can use a putty knife, a rag, and any other tools you need. Wipe it clean when you are done.
 This is the round plastic or metal circle which was under the wax. Inspect the flange: if it looks damaged it may need to be replaced. You can also buy an adaptor (or super flange) if the original is a bit cracked or damaged.
 With the flange in good shape, you can now place new bolts into the flange. They should go in the long channels, in much the same way you hang a picture frame.
 Place the new toilet on its side on top of a towel or other padded surface. Then place the new wax seal over the hole, with the plastic or rubber facing out. Push it hard into place and turn it slightly like a doorknob to get it to stick in place.
 This is very important! Donâ€™t forget to remove the rag!

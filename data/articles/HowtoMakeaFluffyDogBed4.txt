 You can either cut your dog bed insert to the desired size if it is cuttable (like egg crate for instance), or simply draw up a template.


Add one inch to your plans for seam allowances.
 You will probably want to use cotton for this project.
 Round up to the nearest whole number to make computation easier.
 You can also cut out triangular-shaped hourglass blocks to create a varied pattern.


Use a combination of solid and print fabrics to spice up your quilted dog bed.
For a simpler variation, use an old quilt instead of fashioning a new one.
,, Cut out each circle using scissors and lay the two quilts on top of one another with the rough sides touching.


If using a pre-made circular insert or an egg crate, place the insert between the two pieces of fabric before beginning to sew.
 Remember to fold each edge of the quilt inward in order to form a thicker, smoother edge. Make sure to leave a section of the edge open large enough to fit the stuffing through.
 Once again, you can use polyester stuffing, old clothes, pillows, etc. to stuff your dog bed.


Because the quilted covering is more sturdy than, say, a flannel tie covering, you can use heavier stuffing with this method.
 If you are advanced at sewing, you can incorporate a zipper along the sewn edge of the bed in order to remove the stuffing for washing if desired.

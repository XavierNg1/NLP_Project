 Let your kid know that it is time to go in exactly five minutes. You can also raise your hand to motion "five" with your fingers.
 Remind them once a minute that you will be leaving soon. During this time, make sure that your kid understands the departure by looking at you instead of just hearing what you're saying., Let your kid finish the activity they are doing and then tell them it's time's up. Because of all the warnings, your kid won't be surprised playtime is over and should come quietly.

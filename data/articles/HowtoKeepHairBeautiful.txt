 It's the most obvious tip but it's a key factor. Try to brush your hair; in the morning and before you go to sleep.;
, Consider getting a special shampoo that suits your hair type, such as a shampoo for color treated hair or one for dry hair.
 Don't wash too often or you'll strip your hair of its natural oils that help it to stay great. Focus the shampoo on your scalp and conditioner on your hair ends.
 If your hair is damaged or color treated, deep conditioning helps nourish your hair.
 Apply oil in your hair once a week. Massage the oil into your hair and leave for 30 mins, for best look, then wash your hair as usual!

,, Heat damages your hair. Even blow drying it everyday can damage it. If you must use heat (flat iron, curling iron) then use a heat protecting spray.
 You must have your hair styled, even just brushed, in order for it to look beautiful right?


Short hair is easier to look after. So if you have long hair try to trim it more often (every 6 weeks). Just under your shoulder is a good length to look after.
 If you have curly or wavy hair then it's better not to straighten or curl. Only the natural ways. The heat of the straightener will damage your hair and you will have to regret it later.

 Do not dry the pants in a dryer. Lay the wet pants onto a clean, dry towel. Roll them up into the towel. Squeeze the rolled up towel to remove the excess water from the pants. Roll out the towel, and move the pants to a drier part of the towel. Repeat until all of the excess water has been squeezed from the pants.You will probably need to roll up and squeeze the pants in the towel four or five times.
 Lay the pants out on a flat surface. Make sure the flat surface is clean and nothing will be laid on top of the pants. Wait until they are completely dry to pick up and iron or store away., It is best to have a professional iron your pants if they are pleated. If not, you can iron them on your own. Turn them inside out and iron the pockets. Then, turn them back out and iron the rest of the pants. Set a crease in the front by aligning the inseams. Hold the iron a few inches away as you steam along the edge of the inseams., Make sure to hang up your pants after every cleaning. If your pants have pleats, fold them along the pleat and hang them across the hanger. If they are not pleated, simply fold them in half on the hanger and hang them up.Folding the pants on the hanger helps to prevent wrinkles.
Try to avoid hanging your pants in a place that is very humid. Hang your pants in an area that maintains a 40-50% humidity level.

 Some are pre-written, but you'll want to find blank ones to create your own message. Alternatively, you can create your own template with a word processing or desktop publishing program. Open Office, Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Publisher are all good choices.


Free templates will also give you cute ideas for adornments or additions. You can turn doilies into little baptismal gowns or attach a small cross and ribbon, for starter ideas.;
, Use baptism symbols or a picture of your child for baptizing infants and young children. For adults, choose more serious and serene symbols of faith.


If you are making invitations for an adult baptism, your designs could include a bible, crucifixion symbols, sea shells or other items from the beach, candles or other forms of light, doves or other symbols of peace.
Of course, this is completely up to you. If you're happy with a simple border, by all means! Choose whatever speaks to you; it's your (or your child's) moment!

, Keep it brief and informational; save the person's personal testament for the actual baptism event. If desired, include a Bible verse or two that has meaning to the family or person being baptized.


Make sure the message condones the right level of sincerity; baptism is a very important event for most believers.
Keep the font elegant, but easy to read at a glance. Don't use fancy script (cursive) that is often found on wedding invitations for titles and headers.
Include a brief statement about gift expectation. If you don't want attendees to bring gifts, then may be you should suggest they donate to your faith-based organization instead? Whatever your preferences, make them clear.
Don't forget to include the necessities! Time, place, occasion, and if there will be a gathering afterwards need to be listed on your invite.

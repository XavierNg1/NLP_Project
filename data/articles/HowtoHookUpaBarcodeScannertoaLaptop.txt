  If it has a standard USB port then you can plug in the scanner directly to your laptop, if it only has a micro or mini USB port then you will need an adapter that will go from USB Female to USB Mini Male.;
,,  Windows will auto-detect either your scanner or an "unknown human HID device".  Windows has drivers embedded for either scenario, so let the driver installation run by itself.
  Locate the cursor inside the program and scan the barcode.  If the drivers auto-installed correctly then where the cursor is located is where the scanner will send the barcode information to.

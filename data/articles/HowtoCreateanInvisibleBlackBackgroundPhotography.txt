 You don't have to worry about the background, because it'll be gone (black). Do try to eliminate as much as you can. This lessens the likelihood that there will be a stray beam of light reflected off of something.;
, This helps you figure out where to start. It is usually about 200 or 250th of a second.
 100 or 200 are the best, whichever you have.
 What you are looking for is a picture of nothing but black. That is giving you your black background.
 Reduce the aperture.
, The umbrella needs to be a parabolic umbrella, because you will be shooting into it.
 This controls the reflected light much better and makes it more focused.
 If you know the camera's output to be fairly strong, set it for 1/2 power. If not, set it for full power. You can always reset it later.
 Whatever the results are, if they aren't what you want, try raising or lowering the output of the flash. You could also experiment with the umbrella and increasing or reducing its output.

 Whether you are transplanting a flower from one outdoor spot to another or from a pot to a garden, it’s best for the plants to transplant them when they are seedlings, and only about 2–3 inches (5–8 cm) tall. You can transplant them when they are fully bloomed, but if you can, you should transplant young plants or seedling. , If the soils are drastically different temperatures, the transplant can be a shock to your plant and it may suffer. Try to make sure that the soil in the pot and the soil you are transplanting to are similar temperatures.When you are picking a spot to transplant, find one that receives a lot of sun.
 Just as you would do when planting seeds, dig about 6 inches (15 cm) into the soil, then turn it over and sift through it. Break up large clumps and remove any stones or rocks., Make a hole the size of the marigold root ball in the soil you are transplanting to. Gently remove the marigold plant, keeping some of the planting material around the roots of the plant. Place the plant in the small hole, and pat more soil around the plant.
 If you are planting more than one marigold, make sure that they are spaced at least 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm) apart. If you are planting a larger marigold variety, space about a foot apart.

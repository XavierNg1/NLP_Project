 This does not mean you need a mic, after all there are those who don't often use in game signals, so if someone doesn't say your name but shoots you, don't fire a grenade etc. They might be telling you there is a Spartan Laser up on the balcony above you or that there is an enemy around the corner. This rule applies for all team games like CTF or Big Team Battle Objective Games.
 You can only take one shield, but at least it won't kill you.

 You'll be able to make your false eyelashes much faster and without interruption if you have the materials you need on hand.
 Take a length of string and run it along your lash line. Looking in a mirror, measure your lash line from one corner of your eye to the next. Trim your excess thread so you have a length of string that is the total width of your lashes.


If you happen to have saved pre-made eyelashes that you've used before, you can use these to determine your lash-width.
 This can be anything from a subtle trapezoid to gigantic wavy lashes. Using your lash line length thread, be sure that your paper is the right width for your lash line.


You should use your sharp pointed object or a pair of fine scissors to shred the paper to give a realistic look. Be sure to leave a 1-2 millimeter base, otherwise your lashes may not hold up very long.
You may need to experiment with the shape of your paper lashes by gently holding it to your eye to see whether or not the shape you have chosen works.
 Make sure any edges that were created when you cut the lashes are covered. Apply your marker gently to the "hair" part of your false eyelashes, as too much ink may cause discoloration or drooping.

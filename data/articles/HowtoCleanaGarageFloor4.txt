 Epoxy floors usually do not require much heavy-duty cleaning. You can keep the floor clean by using a dust mop once a week. Run the dust mop over the entire floor. Wash the mop head in the washing machine between uses.If you do not have a dust mop, you can also use a broom with soft bristles. Sweep up debris into a dustpan, and throw away.
 Every three to four months, wash the floor with a foam mop. Mix a Â½ cup of ammonia with a gallon of hot water. Dip the mop in the solution, and move it across the floor. Once you are done, you can let it air dry or you can wipe it up with an old towel.Do not use soap-based cleaners, such as laundry detergent, as these may leave residue behind on your floor.Stringy mops may leave streaks behind on your floor.
 If there is any residue left on the epoxy floor from road treatments or salt, you can pour hot water on them to remove them. Wipe it up afterwards with a towel or rag. You can also just hose down the floor and mop it up afterwards., Pour hot water on stains, and gently scrub them with a scrub pad or sponge. If you need to, you can use a gentle cleaning solution like Soft Scrub.

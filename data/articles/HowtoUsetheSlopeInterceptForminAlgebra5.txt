 First, write down the equation so you can start using it to graph a line. Let's say you're working with the following equation: y = 4x + 3. Write it down.
 The y intercept is represented by "+3" or "b" in the equation of a line in slope intercept form is positive 3. This means that the line intersects the y axis at (0, 3). Put your pencil down at this point.
 Since you know that the slope is represented by 4, or "m," you can think of the slope as representing 4/1, the rise over the run of the coordinates on the line. This means that every time the line moves up 4 points on the y axis, it moves to the right 1 point on the x axis. So, if you start at the point (0, 3) and go up ("rise") 4 points, you'll be at (0, 7). Then, you should move to the right ("run") one coordinate, so you get (1, 7) as another point on this line.


If your slope is negative, then you'll either have to move the y-coordinate up instead of down, or move the x-coordinate to the left instead of the right. You'll get the same result either way.
 Now, all you have to do is draw a straight line through those two points and you'll have successfully graphed a line from an equation in slope intercept form. You can keep going -- just pick another point on the line you've drawn and use the slope to move up or down to find additional points on the line.

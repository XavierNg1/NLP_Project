 Many solutions with salicylic acid are sold over the counter to treat corns. Apply the acid directly on the corn; it will help soften the skin that has been hardened. Be careful to apply the acid only on the lesion, as it can harm the healthy tissues surrounding it. Use the remedy each day, after you shower or take a bath, until the condition is treated.You may want to purchase salicylic acid plaster patches, which are sold over the counter and contain up to 40% salicylic acid. To use the patch, file down the corn, then cut the patch to an appropriate size and apply over the corn. Keep the plaster in place for 48 to 72 hours and keep it dry. You can apply these until the corn has disappeared; make sure you are using a pumice to remove dead skin between each application.
 Surgical removal of corns are rare, because they often return after removal.If your doctor for some reason considers surgery, it is more likely that they will shave the bone or correct a deformity that it is creating an unnatural gait. Once you are walking normally, your corns might cease to appear. This procedure, however, is rare. , If the corn is painful, discolored, swelling, or draining liquid, it is likely that it has become infected. The doctor might perform a small operation to drain the liquid or prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection.

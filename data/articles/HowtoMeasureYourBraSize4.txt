 Wrap a tape measure around your ribcage, just beneath where your breast tissue ends. Then:









If the measurement is even: Add 4 inches (10 centimeters).
If the measurement is odd: Add 5 inches (12.5 centimeters).
Be aware that most brands no longer use this band measurement system. The "add four" method was popularized by Warners in the 1930s when bra design was in its infancy and it simply doesn't work with modern bras.Still, it's good to be aware that it's out there.
 Stay standing up, and wrap the tape measure around the fullest part of your breasts. (Keep the tape as horizontal as possible — make sure that it's not sagging around your back.) Subtract your band size from this new number to calculate your cup size:









Less than 1 inch = AA
1 inch (2.5 cm) = A
2 inches (5 cm) = B
3 inches (7.5 cm) = C
4 inches (10 cm) = D
5 inches (12.5 cm) = DD
6 inches (15 cm) = DDD (E in UK sizing)
7 inches (18 cm) = DDDD/F (F in UK sizing)
8 inches (20.5) = G/H (FF in UK sizing)
9 inches (23 cm) = I/J (G in UK sizing)
10 inches (25.5 cm) = J (GG in UK sizing)

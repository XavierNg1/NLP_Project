 Take an old deck of cards, one you don't plan on using anymore. This will permanently bend the cards back, making them unusable later on.






;
, You don't have to count out 26 cards by hand. Simply cut the deck, then place the halves next to each other on a table. Press down on them to remove any air pockets. If they're the same height, then they contain the same amount of cards.
 Really bend the deck into a C-shape, touching the top to the bottom of the card and holding it there for at least 15-20 seconds. You want strong, permanent, and visible kinks in the middle of the deck.









When done, you should have a shallow V-shape, so that the center of the bent deck points upwards in the middle.
 Just do the same thing, bending the deck hard in half, so that you have another heavily bent deck, just reversed.

That said, take the time to learn the full technique to for a better card flower. If you're really struggling with this, just manually re-organize the cards so that they alternate bending back and forth.









Turn the decks both face down. They will be bent in different directions.
Press the short ends of the deck together.
Slide the decks back and forth against each other so the cards work into each other.
Press together once the cards are staggered one after the other.
 It will be a little larger than normal as the bends will probably cause the deck to "rise." The point , however, is that the deck is all squared.









Work lightly when squaring the cards. Forcing or muscling the cards could ruin your bends.
 Simply hold the deck from one of the short sides, and use your hands to let the deck "bloom" to either side. The bends in the cards will make long, 2-card petals as the bends push the cards away from each other.

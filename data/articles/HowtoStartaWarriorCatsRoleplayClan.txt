 These will be your essential role playing items. A large binder to keep papers in, notebooks to write up rules, names of members, whatever is needed, the memo book to keep track of the clans or positions of members, and the field guide as a rule book.;
, They can be friends and family or people you don't know yet and want to get to know., You will need a hunting area, twolegplace, medicine cat, warrior, leader, and apprentice dens, nursery, elder's den, and a fresh kill pile. Place these all in one area which will become your camp.
 Shadowclan, Windclan, Riverclan, Thunderclan, and if you really want to get into it, a distantly connected Starclan. Even create your own clans (Ex.: DustClan, StormClan, TabbyClan, ForestClan, DawnClan,...etc)

, You can go to www.Warriorcats.com and generate names or come up with them yourselves. Decide on a leader, medicine cat, and deputy. Place everyone else in places by age:


0-5 moons: Kit. Belongs in nursery. Needs a mother and father!
6-12 moons: Apprentice. Belongs in apprentice den. Needs a mentor.
13-60 moons: Warrior, can fight and hunt.
60+ moons: Elder. Fed before all other cats.
 At the top of the page write a clan name. Below that write leader. Below that Deputy. Below that Medicine Cat. Below that Queens. Below that Apprentices. Below that Kits. Below that Elders. Next to leader write the name of that clan's leader, next to deputy write that clan's deputy and so forth. Do this for the Warriors, Queens, Kits, and Apprentices and Elders as well. Also, do this for each clan. Store these and the maps in your binder.
 See the articles How to Hunt like a Warrior Cat and How to Fight like a Warrior Cat. Mentors are warriors with an apprentice to train. Assign each apprentice a mentor in every clan except for StarClan., Don't do anything too complicated like warrior cats of the lake and forest together, instead, do something like warriorcats-roleplay.

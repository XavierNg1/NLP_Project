Take two dumbbells of your chosen weight and hold them in front of you, against your shoulders, as if you were about to do a press up.
Hold the weights in this position as you squat, using the same technique described above.
If you want to make this a total body exercise, press the dumbbells straight into the air when you reach the top of the squat â€” this allows you to work your legs, core, back, shoulders, chest and triceps in a single exercise!

This variation can only be performed with body weight squats, not with weighted squats.
Place your hands on the back of your head and squat down as normal. Rise quickly out of the squat and jump straight up into the air.
Immediately squat down again when you land.,


Hold your arms straight out in front of you at shoulder level and lift your right foot off the ground.
Do a one legged squat, lowering your body as far down as possible, while still keeping your right foot off the ground.
Slowly raise yourself back up to the starting position, then repeat with the other leg.



This squat is the same as a normal weighted squat, except you complete the entire exercise while balanced on your toes, with your heels lifted as high off the floor as possible.
It can be somewhat difficult to balance during this exercise, so make sure you have your basic weighted squat technique down before you attempt this.

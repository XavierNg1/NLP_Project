 Some baseball players pour half a bag in their mouth at once, and chew them over the course of an hour. The more seeds you can store in your cheek, the better.
 You want them all to be in the same place, so you have control over them.
 Use your tongue to move it over so it's inside the other cheek.
 Use your tongue to position it between the molars, then bite down to crack the shell.
, Move it over from the storage cheek to the other cheek, bite it between your molars, spit out the shell, and eat the seed.
 This reduces the number of reloads per serving, and it's what the pros do.

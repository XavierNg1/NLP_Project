 Sometimes, a little bit of water is all that is needed to wipe off light stains, such as scuffs and fingerprints. Simple dampen a paper towel, cotton ball, or Q-tip with a little bit of water, and wipe the stain off.
 If water did not remove the stain, you can try a window cleaner that comes in a spray bottle instead. Simply spray some of the cleaner onto the stain, then wipe it off with a paper towel or a soft cloth.
 Dip a Q-tip or a paper towel into some petroleum jelly, and go over the stain using small, circular motions. This is effective on stains caused by color transfers.
 Soak a cotton ball or Q-tip with rubbing alcohol and gently buff the ink stain using circular motions. If the stain persists, you may try some nail polish remover instead. Be sure to wipe the nail polish remover away after you are done. Keep in mind that nail polish remover is much harsher, and may damage the finish.
 If the stain is just on the surface, they simply need to be lifted away. Take a piece of tape, press it down onto the stain, then quickly pull it away. This works great on scuff marks, lipstick, and mascara stains.

 You will want to purchase large zucchini, so that your rounds are large enough to hold toppings. Chop each slice about 1/4 inch thick, and lay out on a pan., Lift each round and lightly spray both the front and back. This is important so that it doesn’t stick to your pan. Then, sprinkle all of them with salt and pepper., Both methods work, so just use whichever one is easiest for you. They should be prepared at a medium-high heat. Set your timer to two minutes, and then flip all of your rounds. Broil or grill them for another two minutes on the other side., Once they’ve been broiled or grilled, place them all on a large, lined baking sheet. Now, it’s time to top your pizza bites. Because they’re so little, it’s easiest to stick with the traditional pizza toppings to achieve the “pizza bite” taste. Add a bit of tomato sauce, cheese, and even tiny pieces of pepperoni, if you like., Once you’ve carefully topped all of your slices, it’s time to pop them in the oven for just a couple more minutes. Keep an eye on it the whole time, because you can ruin your beautiful pizza bites easily at this step. Remove your pan once the cheese has melted, and sprinkle a little bit of Italian seasoning on each bite. Serve these low carb pizza bites as an appetizer or a party treat, and you’re sure to get compliments!

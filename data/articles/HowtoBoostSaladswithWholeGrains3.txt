 Because whole grains contain both the germ and the bran, they can become rancid over time. When buying grains from your local grocery store or specialty food store, make sure the package is secured and sealed. Also take a moment to check the expiration date. When buying in bulk, make sure the grains look and smell fresh.Amaranth, for example, will smell and taste bitter if it is not fresh.Brown rice that has gone bad will have an odor and will look oily., To keep your grains fresh and safe from pests, store them in a sealed container. Keep the containers away from heat, light, and water on a pantry shelf.Barley, amaranth, farro, kamut, oats, and quinoa can be kept for a year or more if they are sealed properly and kept away from sunlight.
Grains like oats and wild rice can last for several years if properly sealed and stored.
Buckwheat has a shorter shelf life of 2 to 3 months., Grains can absorb moisture from the humid air during warmer months, which may cause them to go rancid. Keep your grains in an airtight container and store them in the fridge or the freezer to keep them fresh during hot, summer days., Most whole grains can be prepared in a pot of boiling water, but some whole grains take longer to prepare than others. Be sure to review the labels on your whole grain products to see how long they take to prepare.

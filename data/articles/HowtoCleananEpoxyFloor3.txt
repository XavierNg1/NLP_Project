 Depending on where you live, the changing of the seasons can bring about its own host of messes. Keeping a walk-off, or welcome mat, near the door will allow for the scrubbing off of boots and shoes before stepping on the floor. This will keep snow, water and mud off of the floor, meaning cleaning isn’t needed as often., Vehicles that are kept parked for long periods of time, such as over the winter, can leave tire marks on your epoxy floors. Before parking vehicles for too much time, place cardboard of enough length to completely cover the tire. That way you won’t have an unfortunate surprise come spring., If you keep a motorcycle on your epoxy floors, know that the kickstand could scratch and scuff it. Keep a mousepad in your garage and your motorcycle parked next to it. The kickstand should never come into contact with the floor; the spongy mousepad will keep it protected.

 Mostly on the dry area's, such as your knuckles, your fingertips and in between your thumb and index finger.;
, Gloves are great accessories when Winter arrives. After you've applied lotion, whether you are going out to work or to school; always wear gloves. Leather gloves are more reliable than cotton or polyester gloves, though anything covering your hands during the cold season will work.
 A small bottle of lotion is always handy when you're at work or at school and feeling the irritation and burning sensation of your cracked skin. The unscented kind are probably better off than the floral, fruity (they leave a bit of a distraction) ones when you're out in public. May i recommend Aveeno?

, Make sure you're especially applying the lotion over your hands and knuckles until they feel somewhat smooth. (The process isn't quick.)

, (Ignore this step if your hands aren't severely dry) Nighttime. Right before bed (and after you've applied lotion) apply some Vaseline or any brand of Petroleum jelly all over the dry areas of your hands. Those cotton gloves come in handy during this step! Carefully slip on the cotton gloves (the ones at the dollar store/any cheap ones are fine) and make sure the jelly is secure inside the gloves. Now, it may feel uncomfortable but it works. Sleep with the gloves on throughout the entire night. This is the only way your skin will have the time to heal without any distraction and keep soft during the entire night.

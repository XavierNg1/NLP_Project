 Ionic compounds contain a metal and a nonmetal. Refer to the periodic table of elements to see what categories the elements in the compound belong to.;
, For a two element ionic compound, the naming is simple. The first part of the name is the name of the metal element. The second part is the name of the nonmetal element, with the suffix “-ide.”


Example: Al2O3. Al2 = Aluminium; O3 = Oxygen. So the name would be “aluminium oxide.”

, Metals in the D and F blocks of the periodic table are known as transition metals. Their charge is written with a Roman numeral when writing out the compound name. This is because they can have more than one charge and make more than one compound.


Example: FeCl2 and FeCl3. Fe = Iron; Cl2 = Chloride -2; Cl3 = Chloride -3. The names would be iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride.

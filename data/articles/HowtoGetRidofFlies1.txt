 Pour 1 inch (2.54 cm) of liquid dish soap into a jar and add 1 inch (2.54 cm) of water. The flies will be attracted to the soap and drown in the water.


Use fruit flavored dish soap for best results. An apple scented soap or lemon soap may provide better results, for example.
Add a drop or two of apple cider vinegar if you do not seem to be catching many flies. The vinegar will attract flies to the jar.;
, Flies will stay away from the scent of cayenne pepper. Mix a little in a spray bottle with water.


Spray the cayenne mixture in doorways, window sills and other cracks and corners where flies might try to come in. The smell of the cayenne will keep them out.
 They do not like scents such as lavender, basil and mint. Set up an herb garden in your kitchen or window sills to keep flies out.


Use marigolds if you prefer flowers to herbs. Marigolds are offensive to flies.
 The way the bags and water reflect light will resemble a spider's web, and flies always try to avoid those.


Fill clear plastic bags halfway with water. Seal the bags and hang them near doors and windows.
Hang old CDs and DVDs to achieve the same light effect.

 The first thing you need to do is get an entire deck of cards. Be sure you arenâ€™t missing any because it will affect how you play the game. , Using your study materials, create a list of items you want to review. This list must be numbered and can be anything from definitions to vocabulary.
 You want to eliminate any face cards from your deck because the only cards needed are those with numbers. You may set the face cards aside until you have finished playing.


An alternative to pulling out face cards is using them to play the game. Treat these cards like wild cards and whenever you draw one you can choose to review any item from your list that you wish to review.
 It is very important to shuffle your deck. By doing this, you will ensure that each review item gets chosen by mixing up the numbers within the deck.
 Place your cards in a pile after shuffling them and draw the first card off the top. You may set aside all the cards you have already drawn.
 Look at the number on the card you drew and find the corresponding number on your list of review items. Review the information for that particular number. Continue to draw cards and review the information corresponding to those cards until you have gone through the entire deck.

 Flash does not have any native support on iOS devices. This means that you will need an app that can play Flash files. There are several apps available on the App Store, including Puffin Browser Free, Photon Browser, and iSwifter.
 You can't actually download Flash files from websites using iOS (unless they offer an official download option), so you'll need to use your new browser to load the Flash content while visiting the page. The performance of Flash in the browser will depend on how old your iOS device is.
 If you really want to be able to access Flash files on your iOS device, you'll need to download them to a computer first using one of the above methods. After you've downloaded it to your computer, you can email it to yourself or use cloud storage to transfer it to your iOS device, and then use your Flash Browser to open it.

 Your real income is your annual income minus any taxes and work related expenses. If your annual income was $62,000, taxes were $15,500, and total work related expenses were $10,000, your real income is $36,500.
 This is the sum of all the hours spent at work, on overtime, working at home, and commuting to work. You may have determined that this total is 3000 hours each year.


If you divide your real income ($36,500), by the total number of hours spent on work related tasks (3000), you would get a result of $12.16. This is your real hourly wage.
 In this case, if your annual income was $60,320, and you work 40 hours per week, your paid wage would be $29 per hour. This is the amount it would say on your pay stub. When you factor in taxes, work related expenses, and all the extra time you spend commuting and working at home, you can see that your real hourly wage is significantly less.A lower hourly wage means that things are relatively more expensive for you, and this can help you adjust your spending. You may be less inclined to spend $100 when you realize it equates to almost 10 hours of work as opposed to 3 or 4.
You can also use this figure to compare potential jobs.A new job prospect may have a higher wage on paper, but when you factor in things like commuting time and distance, work from home hours required, or a more expensive wardrobe, you may find that the higher wage job actually has a lower real hourly wage than your current job. This can help you make a better financial decision.

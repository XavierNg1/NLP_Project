 You'll need about 10 feet of paracord, scissors, and a lighter or matches.
 Fold the piece of cord in half.
 Wrap the folded cord around your wrist. Measure the cord by taking the ends through the loop created by the fold. Make a clasp by creating an overhand knot where the bracelet should meet. Essentially, it will be a ball and loop closure with the knot acting as the ball.


To make an overhand knot, take the ends together in your hand. Cross it over itself in the front, making a loop. Push the ends through the loop in the back, bringing them forward. Tighten the loop to form the knot.
Cut off the ends. You should now have a length of folded-over cord as long as your wrist with a knot on one end.
 Place the fold end of the bracelet cord up. Take the other length of cord. Place the middle of it behind the fold, about an inch from the top.
 Pull the right cord over the middle section. Pull the end back to the right, creating a single loop over to the left.
 Pull the left cord over the top of the loop. Weave it under the middle section. You should also have a small loop on the right. Pull the left cord up through it and over it.
 Pull the ends to tighten the knot.
 Pull the left cord over the middle. Pull the end back, creating a loop on the right side (and a smaller loop above it on the left side).
 Loop the right side over the top of the loop, then under the middle cord. Weave it up through the loop on the left side, going over the cord.
 Continue to knot along the bracelet, alternating sides. Tighten up the knot by pulling the strings.
 As you near the bottom, wrap the bracelet around your wrist. Make sure it still fits properly. If you need to, you can undo and redo the bottom knot to shorten or lengthen the bracelet.
 When you reach the end, cut the ends short to the bracelet. Use a match or lighter to burn off the ends.
 Pull the knot through the loop to attach it to your wrist.

 This levitation trick is much simpler, though less impressive. All you'll be doing is standing on your toes, from a carefully chosen angle. The audience should be at least 8–10 feet (2.5–3 meters) away, behind you at roughly a 45º angle.








Make sure the audience stays back. If they're antsy, demand space and make a big deal of "searching for the right spot."
This trick is unlikely to succeed without practicing first. Use a video camera or friend to help you figure out the right angle and control your movements.
 Arrange your feet so your audience can see our entire left foot and the heel of your right foot. The tip of your right foot should not be visible, due to the angle of your body and the left foot placed between you and the audience.
 Pump your arms up, grunt, or bend your knees. The more you get into your body motions, the more you help your audience convince itself.
 With a final effort, "jump" off the ground an inch or two and hover. In reality, all you're doing is bending your right foot and standing on the toes. Your left foot should stay flat and lift completely off the ground. If your angle is well-chosen, the audience will only see the parts of your feet that are "hovering" off the ground.
 After a few seconds, bring your feet down and bend your knees and ankles as you "land," as though you dropped from a significant distance.

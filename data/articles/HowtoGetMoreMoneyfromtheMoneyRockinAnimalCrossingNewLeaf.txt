 It varies to any rock. At every rock, dig to holes to the side, but not next to it (it blocks the bells). Hit the A button as fast and well timed as you can. When you have collected the bells which should be more than 8,100, walk around and find the ore rock. The ore rock is that one rock that wasn't there yesterday. Hit it and an ore will come out. The ore varies. They are all 2,000-5,000 bells. Go to the retail store and sell.;

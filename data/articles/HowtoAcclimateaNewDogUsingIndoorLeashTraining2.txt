 Your new dog will need several things to acclimate comfortably. You’ll need dog food, water bowls, and a dog food bowl. You’ll also need some toys. And besides a good leash and collar, you’ll need ID tags so your dog can be easily identified if it gets lost.Get a ceramic water and dog food bowl rather than a plastic or tin one. Ceramic is heavier and therefore less prone to spilling over.
Different dogs like different toys. Provide a variety of amusing toys for your new dog. For instance, your new dog might enjoy KONG toys, dogs bones, knotted rope toys, and/or bouncy tennis balls.
 If you have other dogs or cats, they may feel jealous or threatened by the presence of a new dog. Pay more attention to them than to the new dog so they don’t feel the are being replaced as the “alpha” pet., A crate is place your new dog can go to retreat from the worries of the world.

The right-sized crate should be large enough for your new dog to stand up and turn around.Place your dog’s food and water bowls near the crate so it associates the crate with good feelings and safety., Like humans, dogs need exercise to stay healthy. Dogs love running, jump, and playing. Set aside time to take your dog walking at the park or just around the block. Go to the beach and play Frisbee with your dog. Toss a ball or chew toy to your dog in the backyard.Always keep your dog on a leash during walks.

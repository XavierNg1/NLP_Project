 Grow-a-Frog kits come with everything you need to go from tadpole to infant African Clawed Frog in several days' time. Start preparing for your future frog's care at least as soon as you receive the tadpole, if not before.;
, Do some internet searches or refer to the links below. These frogs are aquatic, do not withstand handling, and need to be cared for like you would care for a fish. The larger females can grow as large as an adults fist (plus the legs!) They are great fun to watch - especially at feeding time - and can learn to interact somewhat with their caretaker. Adult frogs might even "sing!" Carefully cared-for, they can live from 8 to 30 years.
 Check the "Things You'll Need" list, below. Little infant frogs don't need much room at first, but they grow very fast and appreciate having space in which to swim. They also need something to hide under when they feel like it. A light and filter are optional, but a cover is absolutely not optional. A heater is recommended for most North-American locations.
 Fill the tank at least 3/4ths full, but do not fill to the top. Aquatic frogs need air to breathe! Treat the water according to directions and allow 12 to 24 hours for it to reach the proper temperature before introducing your frog.
 You can order a second tadpole or another infant frog shortly after the first one transforms. These frogs are social animals, and will enjoy the company of a frog friend.

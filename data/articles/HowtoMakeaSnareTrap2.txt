 Think of linking your own hands together (fingernails tucked into the other hand) and pulling your elbows apart. That is the tension you'll be using.


The base should be longer than the hook and a bit sturdier.
The hook can be small--as long as it fits into the mouth of the base.
 It is easier to drive into the ground if you carve it into a peg shape first. The point breaks the soil much more quickly.


The base should be very close to the sapling you scouted out; the two will work in tandem.
 Make a knot that will not come off, even under tension. It should be about 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) from the top, depending on the strength of the sapling.


Test it before you assume it's sturdy. Remember: the animal will be struggling.
 Place the hook in mouth of base. Right now, the base should be the only thing preventing the hook from flying up into the air and the sapling straightening out.


Make sure your cord is the proper length. When the hook is in place, the sapling should be bent towards a 90 degree angle. When the hook is removed, it should straighten up again (dangling the animal).
 Again, make sure the knot is securely in place. At this point, the hook should have two cords attached: one to the noose and one to the sapling.
 The snare is in place. All that's left is arranging a noose, filling it with bait, and snaring your game.


Make the noose wide enough that it won't miss your target. You can spread it out on the ground with small twigs or pebbles; they won't interfere with it flying up when the animal is caught.

 Try rubbing the inside of a banana peel onto your skin to relieve itching. Note that this does not treat the underlying cause, but it may provide relief from the itch itself.
 Some people claim banana peels can eliminate warts on the hands, although the scientific community is skeptical.Still, this is unlikely to cause any harm, so consider taping a piece of banana peel, inside down, over your wart for the night. Repeat with a fresh piece of peel each night for a week or two, to see if there is any effect.
 Rumor has it that the inside of a banana peel can be rubbed onto leather shoes or other leather objects, followed by buffing with a cloth to create a shine. This may or may not work, but leather experts do not advise trying it on highly valued leather., Toss your banana peels in the compost to add nutrients for your garden. If there are rodents, raccoons, or other scavengers in your area, be aware that they may come after this. Consider setting up an enclosed, animal-proof compost bin instead, and using the compost once the banana peels and other materials have degraded.

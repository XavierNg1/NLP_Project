 Instead of letting rain fall from your roof onto the street and into the storm drains, you could catch it in a barrel! You can purchase rain barrel collection systems from larger hardware stores. If you don’t have the time to set one up yourself, you may be able to find a local gardening company that will install it for you.Rain barrels cost between $80 and $100.
 The next time you boil some potatoes, you could pour the leftover cooking water into a plastic bucket. When you go out to water your garden, use the bucket of potato water to nourish a few of the plants.If you have a fish tank, you could save the fishwater the next time you clean the tank. Use it to water part of your garden.
 Put a bucket in the shower before turning it on. As you wait for the water temperature to warm up, you’ll be catching the water that would normally go down the drain. Put the bucket on your porch and use it to water a few plants the next time you have to water the garden.

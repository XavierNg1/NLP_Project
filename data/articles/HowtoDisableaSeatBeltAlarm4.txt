 You should not cut any wires until you are sure that this will not interfere with your airbag deployment. If you find you do have a need to cut the wires on your seat belt alarm to disable it (and if you're sure that it won't affect the airbag in your car), you will need to carefully identify the correct wires. Also be warned that cutting the wires may void all or part of your warranty.
 You will see a wire that connects to the buckle with the release button. It should be towards the rear on the right hand side. This is the wire you are looking for.
 You want to trace the wire back to an area under the seat that is easily accessible to you. This will allow you to get your hands under the seat and work efficiently. It may be difficult to find a good position to get your hands under your seat.
 These two wires are connected when your seat belt is latched, and disconnected when it is unlatched. That is how the seat belt sensor knows when to ding. You will need to connect them permanently., This will disconnect both wires from your seat belt receptacle. It will also give you the wire ends you need to splice these wires together. That will connect them permanently., You want to connect the two pieces of wire that are coming to/going from your seat belt sensor. That means, do not connect the ends of the wire that go to your seat belt receptacle. To connect the wires, twist, crimp, or solder them together., This will prevent them from shorting out on metal underneath the seat. You can do this by covering them in electrical tape. Heat shrink tape also works well.
 This will prevent them getting tangled if you move your seat. Tangled wires may eventually be pulled apart or broken. This would ground the wires and cause your alarm to ding constantly (until it was fixed).

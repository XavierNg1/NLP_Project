 Dig into the peel with the blade of the peeler or knife just enough to get it started. You’ll then be able to apply just enough pressure to strip the peel while steering clear of the pith.Slice both ends off of the citrus to give yourself a more convenient starting point.
A brief soak in lukewarm water can help soften fruits with tough rinds, such as limes.
 If you’re using a peeler, simply pull it towards you to remove the peel one strip at a time. If you’re using a knife, you’ll need to carefully guide the blade around the outer edge of the fruit in a spiral motion. Pause to rotate the citrus after each section of peel you remove.It can be tricky at first to zest a citrus fruit with a veggie peeler. The more times you do it, the better you’ll get at using just the right amount of force.
Angle the blade of the knife downward into the fruit to keep from slipping and cutting yourself., After peeling the citrus, you’ll be left with a pile of strips of varying sizes. These strips might be a little too unwieldy as-is, but you can easily reduce them to a more usable size by chopping them with a sharp knife. Add the zest to drinks, dinner or dessert while it’s still fresh to get the most out of the potent oils.Slice the strips into long, thin slivers for garnishes, pastry fillings, stir fries, and anything else where you want to highlight the bold flavor of the citrus.Try kicking up the taste of salad dressings, remoulades, and aoilis with a hint of fresh citrus zest.

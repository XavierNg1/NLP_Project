However, use extreme caution in doing so, as you're probably more likely to attract attention to your hiding spot. As such, it is better to throw stuff off of your path before you hide.

Tiger mothers are ferociously protective of their young and will readily come to their defense if they feel they are threatened in any way. Do not approach or attempt to interact with a cub in any way if you see one.In the wild, it is very rare to spot cubs because they are fiercely protected by their mothers. With that said, just because you see a cub all by themselves wondering around aimlessly doesn't mean that the mother isn't somewhere nearby.

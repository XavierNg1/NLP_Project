 Follow the directions above for making your own sopapilla dough, but don’t cut the dough into triangles.
 These will need to be fried, not baked, so pour oil into a pan and heat to 400 degrees. You will need to pour a bit more oil that you would for regular sopapillas, as these will take up more space because of the filling.
 Flatten the dough so it is thin but without holes, and then cut it into circles between 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) in diameter.
 For these, you can use nearly any filling imaginable. For a savory sopapilla, fill the dough with rice, beans, and meat. For a sopapilla that can be eaten for dessert, try using a pie filling or chocolate chips.
 Thoroughly close the edges of the dough around the filling by rolling them in slightly and then pinching them tightly. It is very important the edges be closed to not leak filing into your frying oil and create a big mess.
 Place each into the hot oil, waiting 1-2 minutes on each side for the sopapilla to turn golden brown. Fry as many at once as the pan size will allow.
 Place them onto a wire rack covered in paper towels to allow the excess oil to drain off. Allow time to cool, at least ten minutes.
 Although your sopapillas are filled, you can choose to add more on top as well. For a savory sopapilla, top with cheese or salsa. A dessert sopapilla can rolled in more cinnamon and sugar or sprinkled with powdered sugar.

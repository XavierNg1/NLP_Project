, Place all these items in the large heavy duty garbage bag you can find, pour in one gallon of ammonia, then seal the bag and let it sit for 24 hours (in the bathtub if indoors).
 Cover the floor underneath the stove with layers of newspaper. Read the cleaner instructions carefully, and apply as the manufacturer directed.
 Wear the gloves, and wipe the stove from the back to the front (wear old clothes and something to cover your hair). Rinse the sponge well between wipes. Use the oven cleaner with a scrub pad (and rubber gloves) to remove the formerly mentioned baked on crud under the stove top. Use a good quality degreaser product (like Simple Green) to remove any residue left. For stubborn spots, spray until soaked and leave until later.
 Carefully open the garbage bag from yesterday with all the components (rubber gloves, again). Remove the smaller pieces first, and wash in the bucket with a scouring pad. Grease should just fall off. Rinse in clear water, and let dry. If any plastic pieces appear dulled by the process, spray on a little Armor All or similar product, allow it to dry and buff it out. The racks may be a little tougher, but perseverance will pay off.
 Again, wipe down any residue and check to make sure the burners and oven work. It probably looks better than it did when you leased the place, and should make an impression on your landlord and get you back a couple of hundred dollars.

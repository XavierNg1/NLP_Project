 Don't start a shop if you're not sure you can follow through with your customers' wishes.;
, If you can't do it, you can't do it. Let your customer know this.
 Don't keep the customer waiting.
 Get the word out. If you have a blog, post an advertisement selling your shop. That will bring you more customers.

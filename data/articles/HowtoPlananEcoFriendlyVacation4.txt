 Many hotels have become eco-friendly in which they provide non-toxic bedding, use renewable energy, use non-toxic cleaning products, and contain recycling facilities. Some hotels also insist on serving organic meals and using recyclable products. Online searches have made it much easier to find these places, and there are often books in the library that provide a round-up of green hotels and resorts around the world.


If it's not clear from the website or brochure information, contact hotels directly to inquire whether or not they provide green and eco-friendly accommodations. Generally this is a major selling feature now, so most will make it clear in their promotional materials.
 For example, a list of eco-friendly resort options is available on the "Boston Today's Mama" website which is provided to you in the Sources section of this article. Many blogs written by eco-conscious travelers will give you excellent insights into places to stay and might include recommendations.

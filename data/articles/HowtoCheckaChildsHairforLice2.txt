 It may be helpful to detangle hair with a brush or comb first.
 This process will be similar to wet-combing.


If nits pose a problem to thorough combing, try soaking hair in a 3%-5% white vinegar bath prior to using the lice comb., You might be able to pin lice against the comb using your fingers, but tweezers may be more effective.Some experts say that manually removing lice as described above may be more effective (though also more time consuming) than over-the-counter lice treatments., Lice can survive in water, and may escape if not properly dealt with after combing. You should also soak the combs used to find and catch lice in rubbing alcohol for at least one hour., If you have found lice and/or nits and removed them with a comb or tweezers, it is important to repeat the procedure on a daily basis. Eggs may take several days to hatch, so it's important to continue treatment and removal, even if it seems like the problem is getting better. Some experts recommend nightly lice inspection and removal and continued monitoring for two to three weeks after the initial treatment.While dry combing is an excellent way to detect lice, picking individual lice with tweezers can be a tiresome and time-consuming activity for both you and your child. Some experts recommend wet combing, as it allows you to quickly diagnose and partially treat the infection more efficiently.If your child has a hard time sitting still for prolonged periods, try doing lice inspection/removal with a movie or TV show on. Television may provide a welcome distraction for your child while you look for and remove lice and nits.
 Even if your child doesn't show any signs or symptoms of a lice infection, if one of their friends has lice, it's best to take precautions.

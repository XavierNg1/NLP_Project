 Brutal knobbing (the method above) can produce a lot of blooms but it comes at the expense of the shape of the tree. This is because crepe myrtles will skin over and repair any place where a branch has been removed. Therefore, imagine that after you've pruned, whatever you leave behind will grow larger in both circumference and length each year.


Look at images of crepe myrtles from a hundred years ago and you'll see how beautiful the tree looked when pruned more gently.
 These are called "suckers." Left untrimmed, these will give your crepe myrtle a bushy appearance, and may compete with your main trunks for resources. Suckers can be pulled out when they first sprout or trimmed with a hand pruner. Leave the large, healthy, thick trunks to keep growing taller and stronger., Prune any branches coming out of side of the trunk up to about halfway up the trunk. This is called limbing-up, and helps the tree retain an attractive shape.


For younger trees that you are starting to shape, prune the small limbs from the ground up, leaving only the 3-5 strongest limbs.
Remove smaller branches that are growing horizontally or toward the inside of the tree.
 You can use hand pruners for small, thin branches that you can reach, loppers for branches that are more than 1/2 inch (12 mm) thick, or a pole pruner for thicker or taller branches. Cut branches that are growing at an angle or that detract from the shape you are trying to achieve.
 Branches that are too thin will still bloom, but they will not be able to bear the weight of the blooms and will droop or break.If you're cutting a branch back to the trunk, cut flush with the trunk instead of leaving a stub.
Use loppers for lower branches or pole pruners for the tall ones out of reach.
It is not necessary to cut off seed pods. It won't affect blooming.

 Instead of using the standard bow or string, create a geometric-shaped gift “topper” from cardstock or construction paper.
 Consider using a plain colored paper instead of something with a pattern, as your flourish will have enough design.
 You could cut out a few triangles and squares or all circles; be creative and go with what your artistic side brings forth.
 Keep in mind of the size and shape of your gift when using this method. You’ll want to keep the shapes small enough to fit on the gift, but large enough to draw attention.
 You could either tape shapes to string and then tie the string around the gift or you could attach the shapes directly to the gift.

 Using a hot baking sheet will cause the dough to start to melt prematurely. Grease the cookie sheet with vegetable shortening or unsalted butter -- don't use vegetable oil because it'll burn between the cookies, and that's not a pleasure to clean. Some cookie dough recipes, however, have a lot of shortening or butter in it already and may not need to have the cookie sheet greased at all., Use a parchment paper or Silipat lined baking sheet for ease of cookie baking. The baking sheet is easier to clean and will not suffer from greasy build up, if either is used while baking. Another plus is the cookies can be carefully removed from the baking sheet by pulling the parchment paper carefully from the cookie sheet and placing it on a cooling rack. The cookie sheet can be lined again with parchment paper and another batch of cookies can be baked.
 Use a cookie scoop or measuring spoon to make sure drop or shaped cookies are all the same size. The cookies will bake evenly and taste better.
 A time range is often given in a recipe, so once you reach the short end of the range, stick a toothpick right in the center of a cookie, and pull it out quickly. If little or no cookie sticks to the toothpick, they are done. Depending on amount of cookie left on toothpick, adjust cooking time accordingly.
 It is best to either let the cookies cool on the sheet, or to move them to a cooling rack. If you do not have a cooling rack, just turn a large plate upside down, and place the rack on top until it cools. Once the cookies have cooled slightly, remove them from cookie sheet to prevent them from sticking and breaking later.

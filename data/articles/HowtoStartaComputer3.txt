 This key is in the row of keys at the top of your PC's keyboard. When starting up your computer, you'll hold down F8 to enter the safe mode options panel.

If your PC has an Fn key at the bottom-left side of the keyboard, you may need to press it and F8 at the same time to activate safe mode.
 This will start your computer.

If your computer was simply sleeping, press and hold the power button until the computer turns off, then press it again to turn on your PC.
 You'll do this immediately after your computer begins to start up. This action will launch the boot menu, which is where you'll find the option to start in safe mode.


If nothing happens while holding F8, restart your computer, then press and hold Fn+F8.
 This key should be on the right side of your keyboard.
 Doing so will start up your computer in safe mode.

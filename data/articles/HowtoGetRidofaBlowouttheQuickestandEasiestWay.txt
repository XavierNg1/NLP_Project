 (This will help stop germs from getting into the skin and infecting the blowout even more);
, Just put sea salt at the very bottom of a tall cup (enough so that the salt is covering the whole bottom. About 1 tbsp) and fill the cup up with lukewarm water. Make sure that the cup is tall enough for your stretched ears to soak in. Do not use the same cup of water to soak your ears! Rinse the cup out and start fresh every day.
 Lots and lots of oil! Oil as in Vitamin E oil, castor oil, jojoba oil, emu oil, tea tree oil, coconut oil, olive oil. Any oil! just choose one to use up to 3 times a day on your blowout and massage it very well It might hurt if your blowout is still fresh, but the outcome will be very good if you are very consistent with your moisturizing your ears.
 Tell yourself that the blowout will heal!

, Check for redness and swelling. If there are still signs of swelling and redness after three days, do not touch your ears, and leave it alone for a while. Ice packs will probably be the best solution.
Â :(

, This will probably take up to 3 to 4 weeks. And remember that oils and patience are the key! Make sure the next time you stretch, use ointment on your ear and the jewelry and you should be fine and back to healthy stretched ears in no time!

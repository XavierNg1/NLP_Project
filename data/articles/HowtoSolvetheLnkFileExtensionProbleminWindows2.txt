 Windows offers its users a convenient System Restore feature. This feature allows users to revert back to a recent point when their computer was working just fine. This nifty tool will undo any recent changes made to the registry and will uninstall programs that were incorrectly installed; without affecting existing files. Here is how you can Do a System Restore.
 In the search box, type “System Restore”.
 This will automatically run the wizard.
 Select an earlier date to restore your system to. Windows will automatically select the most recent restore point.


If you wish to select a different restore point, tick the “Show more restore points” box. You will find this at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen.
Click Next. A list of available points will be displayed on the screen. Each point will have a description, detailing the changes made in that restore point.
Choose your desired restore point. Click on the restore point to choose it.
The wizard will ask to confirm your choice. Confirm your choice of restore point.
Click “Finish”. Then click “Yes” for the wizard to restore your system to an earlier state.
Note that it will take the wizard a while to complete the restore. Wait patiently, till you receive a prompt that the restore was successful.
 Reboot Windows and work with it to confirm that the restore was successful.


In case some previously installed programs are still giving trouble, you may have to install them again.

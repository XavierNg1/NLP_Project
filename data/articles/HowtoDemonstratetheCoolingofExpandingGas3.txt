 The ideal gas law describes the behavior a hypothetical gas in which molecules do not interact with each other, except for totally elastic collisions. Elastic collisions will result in no net energy change. According to this law, if volume increases and pressure is held constant, temperature would increase. Thus it is clear that real gases do not behave in an “ideal” way. The equation describing this behavior is the infamous PV=nR:P = Pressure
V = Volume
n = Moles of Gas
R = Ideal Gas Constant
T = Temperature

, The primary difference between ideal and real gases is that real gases have molecules that interact in non-elastic ways. That is to say, the energetic state of the molecules changes based on how they interact with each other. This means that heat will rise in a smaller volume of gas (due to more collisions between molecules) and will fall when the same amount of gas occupies a larger volume., It is important to realize that adiabatic conditions are theoretical. There is no such thing as a perfectly insulated system, and there will be some heat exchange with the outside universe. That said, if measurements are taken quickly enough, that exchange can be negligible for this experiment.

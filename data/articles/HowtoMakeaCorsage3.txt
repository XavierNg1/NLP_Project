If you wrap the ribbon around the stem:

If you decide to wrap the stems with ribbon, position the wrapped loops at the base of the flower and wrap the stems around the ribbon going downward toward the end of the stem.
Wrap the stems again going back upward toward the base of the flower.
Cut the ribbon with a pair of scissors when you are finished. Leave a length of about 1-1/2 to 2" (4 to 5 cm) at the end.
Tie the loose ends of the ribbon together rightly to secure the bow to the bouquet. Wrap a loop of florist's tape around the tied ends if that will make you feel that they are more secure. If you've used silk flowers, use a dab of hot glue instead of tape.


If you decide not to wrap the stems in ribbon:

Cut the ribbon, leaving a 1/2 to 2" (4 to 5 cm) tail.
The the ends of the ribbon behind the bouquet. Tie them tightly to secure the bow to the blooms. Add florist's tape or hot glue, if needed, for extra security.
,, If you use a plastic resealable bag, blow air into the bag before you seal it so that the blooms aren't crushed by the bag.,

If you've used fresh flowers, refrigerate the corsage until you're ready to transport it.
If you've used silk flowers, then place the corsage in a cool, dry place so that it won't fade in the light.

 To set up a game of beer darts, each player must be in a seated or squatting stance.


In a tailgate setting, it is common for players to be seated on a cooler. Chairs or improvised seating can also be used.
Each player should begin with an opened but full can of beer. This can should be placed on the ground directly in between the player's feet.
In a 2-player game, each player should be facing the other player, separated by a distance of about 10 feet (3 m). If using a multiple-player variation, you could have players positioned in a circle.;
, The basic progression of the game involves each player throwing a single dart at their opponent's beer can in turn. The object is to puncture or at least strike the can with your dart.
 In beer darts, different actions are taken depending on how the dart strikes the beer can. If the dart contacts the beer can but does not puncture it, the struck player must take a small sip of their beer.
 When a beer can is punctured, it will begin to leak beer from the hole. In this case, the punctured player must "drink to the hole," meaning to consume their beer so that the level of the liquid lies just below the hole.
 Of course, beer darts presents a risk of personal injury. If you throw a dart and it strikes any part of your opponent's body, you must take a sip of your own beer as a penalty.
 There are 2 ways to win a game of beer darts: either by puncturing your opponent's can 3 times, or by forcing them to consume their entire beer.


If your can receives 3 punctures, regardless of how much liquid remains in it, you have lost. Consume the remainder of your beer and cede your place to whomever wants to play the next round.
If you are forced to finish your beer, either by taking the final sip or because the can was punctured near the very bottom, you have lost.

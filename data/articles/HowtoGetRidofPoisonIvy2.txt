 Fill a spray bottle or garden sprayer with plain, undiluted white vinegar and apply directly to the poison ivy.As with chemical herbicides, vinegar can be applied to untrimmed leaves as well as cut stems.
Vinegar will take longer to work than most chemical herbicides, but as long as you are willing to put in the extra time, the treatment should work.
 Combine 3 lbs (1350 g) of salt, 1 gallon (4 liters) of water, and 1/4 cup (60 ml) liquid soap in a garden sprayer. Apply the concoction directly to the poison ivy.


Use the treatment primarily on uncut leaves. You can also use it on cut stems, however,
For an even stronger solution, add vinegar into the mix. Dissolve 1 cup (250 ml) of salt in 1 gallon (4 liters) of white vinegar over low heat. Once cool, stir in about 8 drops of liquid dish detergent and apply the solution to the poison ivy as a spray.
 Boil a kettle or pot of water and dump the hot liquid directly over the roots of the poison ivy plant.


This will need to be done on a daily basis, and it may take quite some time before the plant actually dies off.
The boiling water can be dumped on the base of the plant, but for best results, dig away some of the soil surrounding the base to expose a portion of the roots directly.
Note that even dead poison ivy plants have poisonous oils on them, so you should still take precaution when removing them.
 When grass grows, the roots choke out the roots of the poison ivy, making it difficult if not impossible for the plant to come back.


This treatment takes quite some time since the grass needs an adequate amount of time to grow. In the meantime, you should keep up on removing or cutting down poison ivy plants you see.

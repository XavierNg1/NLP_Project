 Before anyone tries to pull a baby tooth out, it should be moving quite a bit. That is, your child should be able to move it back and forth and side to side without much pain. Lots of movement means the tooth is about ready to come out.As noted, it's always best to let the baby tooth fall out on its own if possible.;
, Wiggling it is a great way to start getting that tooth out. Have your child wiggle it around with their tongue. They can do this movement throughout the day until the tooth falls out. Tell your child to only wiggle it as much as they can without discomfort., To speed up the loosening process, offer carrots, apples, or other crunchy foods to help loosen the tooth gradually. It might even come out on its own with the child barely noticing.
 The best way to pull out a kid's tooth is to grasp it with tissue or gauze. Try to pull the tooth out with a gentle tug. If the tooth is especially resistant or the child cries out, it's best to wait a few days. However, the tooth will often come right out.Some kids won't like you touching their teeth at all, and in that case, it's best to leave it alone. You can also let the child try to pull it out themselves.
 If the tooth is growing erratically or takes more than two to three months to come out, it's a good idea to see the dentist. Ask whether or not the tooth should be removed or left to fall out on its own.After consulting the dentist, be sure to follow their advice exactly.
 If the area is bloody after the tooth falls out, hold a cotton ball gently to the gum. You can also have the child bite on it. You may need to hold it on as long as 30 minutes, as gums take longer to clot than other parts of the body.

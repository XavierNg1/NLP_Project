 Measure out the amount of rice you wish to cook, usually 1 cup. Rinse the rice thoroughly in cold water, then soak for 45 minutes. This will help to soften the rice.
 Drain the rice and pour into the inner vessel of the rice cooker.
 Pour water into the rice cooker until it reaches the 2 1/2 cup to 3 cup mark, depending on how soft you like your rice. Add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
 Fit the lid of the rice cooker on securely, plug it in, and press the switch to turn the cooker to cooking mode. The red light should be on.
 Leave the rice to cook for approximately 45 minutes. When the rice is cooked, the cooker should automatically switch to "warm" mode. Fluff the rice up with a fork before serving.

 You can also copy and paste the list of words that you want to sort into a document. In order to alphabetize the words, they need to be formatted as a list, with each entry on its own line.
 If your list is the only part of your document, you don't need to highlight anything. If you want to alphabetize a list that is part of a larger document, highlight the section that you want to sort.
 Select Sort. This will open the Sort Text dialogue box.
 By default, the sorting will happen by paragraph. Click the Ascending or Descending button to select which order the list should appear. Ascending will put the list in alphabetical order, and Descending will put the list in reverse alphabetical order.If you want to sort by the second word for each entry (for example, by last name in a FIRST, LAST format), click the Options button in the Sort Text window. In the “Separate fields by” section, select Other and enter a single space. Press OK, and then select Word 2 in the Sort By menu. Press OK to sort the list.

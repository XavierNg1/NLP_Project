 If you are trying to lift up a small adult dog that is injured, you should move carefully around the dog. Make sure you are standing behind the dog with your legs hip width apart. Then, crouch down so you are at the dog's level.When you are crouching behind the dog, you should observe any sensitive areas on the dog and avoid touching these spots when you lift them up. If you notice bandages around the dog’s ear, for example, you should make sure you avoid touching that spot when you lift the dog up.
 Place your non-dominant hand under the dog’s head, cupping their chin in the crook of your arm. You may then place your fingers on top of the dog’s head or around the side of their face.Be careful not to put your hand too close to the dog’s mouth, especially if they appear agitated or upset when you touch them. Hold your fingers in a fist if you want to keep your fingers out of the way.
 Use your dominant hand to support the dog’s hind quarters. Cup your hand under the dog’s butt, using your open palm as a support. Make sure you have a good hold of your dog’s hind quarters with your hand.If you are not comfortable lifting the dog with your hand, you may slide your arm under the dog’s hind quarters and use your arm to support this area.
 Once you have a good hold of the dog with both hands, raise the dog up from the crouching position. Lift with your legs so your lower back is protected. Keep the dog close to your chest as you raise them up.


You should be able to carry the injured dog a short distance using this hold.
If the dog has an injury on one or more of its limbs, you should try to put the dog down on a safe, solid surface as soon as possible, as carrying the dog for a prolonged period of time can make the injury worse.

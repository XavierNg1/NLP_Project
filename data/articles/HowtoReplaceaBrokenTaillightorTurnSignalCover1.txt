 This type is found mostly in older vehicles and will be relatively easy to replace with only a screwdriver.


Locate the turn-signal cover and the screws that are holding it in place.
Use either a Phillips, slotted or, in some cases, a specialized screwdriver -- sometimes called a star -- to remove the screws holding the lens cover in place.
Gently pull out on the lens cover. If it is a two-piece unit -- lens cover and light bulb holder -- then replace the lens cover and screw it back into place.
If it is a combination lens and light bulb holder, pull out the unit exposing the light bulb holder and wiring.;

Turn counter-clockwise and pull the bulb holder from the lens case.
Reverse the procedure, reinserting the light bulb holder into the new turn-signal cover and screw it back into place on the vehicle.

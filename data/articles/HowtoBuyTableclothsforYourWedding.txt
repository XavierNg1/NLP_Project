 Table adornments and accessories should be chosen after you know what theme the wedding reception will have. This includes color and texture––have a clear picture in your mind as to what you want reflected for both.;
, Not only does this determine the amount of tablecloths but it also impacts the size of the tablecloths. If you have varying sizes of tables, you'll need to take the measurements and bring those along when shopping.


Don't neglect any ceremony tables. If the place officiating your wedding isn't taking care of this for you, you may need a tablecloth for the signing table, at least.
The gift table is another table that is often improved by using tablecloths. It doesn't necessarily need to be the same as the tables but it should complement the color theme at least.
 This is determined by the wedding color theme. However, you will need to consider shades and complementary colors that might work too; just how much color do you want the table as a whole to invoke? The more color you want, the more likely it will be that you'll choose a strongly colored tablecloth like magenta, royal blue or dark green, while for a simpler, more natural wedding, you might prefer white, cream or beige tones.
 Color is important but so is texture.

Natural: Cotton, linen, lace, etc.






Glamorous: Satin, velvet, organza, tulle, etc.






Country: Gingham, rough textures, muslin, burlap, etc.






Layered: Pretty layered tablecloths can create a fairytale, glamor or sweet feel to the decorating






Metallic: Shiny tablecloths in silver, gold or metallic colors might work for some themes but be careful as they can be overwhelming.
 When choosing the color, texture and size, keep in mind that the tablecloth is a supporting act, not the star. Keep contrasts simple, so as to make decorating easier.

Avoid stark, strong or bold patterns. These rarely work well with the other decorative features and threaten to upstage even the bride.






Dramatic, vibrant colors may seem dazzling in the store but can be too dramatic or vibrant when placed on the wedding tables.






Beware clashing colors or styles. Even keep your dress in mind when selecting the fabric types, especially if the tablecloths will serve as a backdrop while dancing or giving speeches.
 These small additions don't add that much to costs while definitely adds to the classiness of the reception tables

 First you need to get the data needed for this calculation. You should get the mass on kilograms (Kg), the height the object is off the floor in meters (m) and the gravity pull which is 9.81 (m/s2).


Example: A 2 Kg book being held 2 meters off the ground with a gravity pull of 9.81 m/s2.;
, So to get the GPE of an object you need a formula, the formula is MASS X GRAVITY X HEIGHT (M X G X H).
 So next you need to replace the letters (M, G, and H) with your data. So for the book example, it would be: 2 x 9.81 x 2.
 The last step is to solve the formula and there you go, you have the GPE of your object. The GPE of the book is 39.24 Joules.

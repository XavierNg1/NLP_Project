 Be sure to select a different mineral pile for each drone.It will be better that every drone start to mining at the same time.;
, Especially on a map with greater than two starting locations, it's critical that you know where your opponent is so that your early zerglings can do a large amount of damage.
 Instead, wait until you have sufficient minerals for a spawning pool.
, Use the 1st or 2nd one you build to start to scout if it is a 3 or more player map.
 Build 3 sets of zerglings, and scout if needed.
, If you do not micro, you are guaranteed to lose. Mainly focus on the basic military units, then the miners, and then the buildings. Note: if you do not keep sending zerglings over to the enemies' base there is a good chance that person will overcome the technique, and win himself/herself for rushing is key.
 The enemy will eventually crack and give in unless they have a good defense.

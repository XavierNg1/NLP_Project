 Don’t talk about it constantly or brag about it, because people will find out that you are good at these things eventually regardless. Bragging is not something that a tough guy would do, that’s something a poser would do. Eventually people will know you as a fighter and think of you as being hard and tough. Even more importantly, you will be tough. , It is true that pain is necessary to know when something in your body is wrong, but don't let it dominate your mind. This is related to not complaining. It's okay if something hurts, but learn how to deal with it. Don't do something crazy like sticking your hand on a hot stove to build pain tolerance or anything like that. Try going on long runs to feel what it's like to be in discomfort for a long period of time. Adopt a sport like wrestling. These are natural and healthy ways to build your pain tolerance.
 Whenever a list of chores is being given out, do what nobody else wants to do and do it with pleasure. Of course, you already have to have adopted the tough guy mentality for this to work. If you clearly hate the dirty job you won’t be doing yourself any favors. Make the best of it and don’t complain – that’s really what being a tough guy is about. Just take what comes to you and run with it.

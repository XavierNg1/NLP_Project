 Start with clean, dry hair, since it's more difficult to control the length when you work with wet hair. Use a wide-toothed comb to comb all of the tangles from your hair, so that the layers you create will be neat.;
, Bend over so your head is upside down, comb your hair forward, and use your hands to form a ponytail at the top of your head. Fasten it there with a hair elastic, then turn your head right sideÂ  up. Make sure your hair is smooth against your head; any lumps or tangled parts could result in messy layering.
 Slide it down until it's a couple of inches from the end of the ponytail. If you want subtle layering, slide the elastic down so there is only an inch or so of hair remaining in the ponytail. For more drastic layers, leave a few inches of hair in the ponytail.
 Hold your hair at the elastic to keep it from coming loose. Use a sharp pair of haircutting scissors to cut your hair just above the elastic, then shake out your hair.

If your hair is quite thick, you may have to cut through the ponytail in more than one section. Just make sure you cut each section at the same length, just above the elastic.
Be careful not to cut at an angle or let the scissors slip. Cut straight across for even layers.
 This method creates a few face-framing layers in the front with longer layers in the back. If you'd like to adjust the length of your layers, use the scissors to carefully cut individual locks of hair.

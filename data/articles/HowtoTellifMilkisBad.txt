 Fresh milk should have no odor at all and must have the usual smell of the milk. The milk starts smelling unpleasantly and tastes tangy if it has gone off.;
, Milk is a thin liquid with a smooth texture. It should not have an inconsistent color, lumps or be yogurt like. Quarantine the milk immediately if it has a thick cottage cheese like appearance.
 Milk should always be a pure clean white. If the milks carton is not transparent, try pouring some into a glass and hold it up to light. Spoiled milk is normally a darker shade such as yellow.
 It is required by law that milk has to have a 'best before' stamped on the packing. Scientists recommend to use milk before 3 days of the 'best before' date.
 Due to different circumstances milk can go off before the use by date. Milk should be stored at 39°F (4°C), but when stored in the freezer it can last the 'best before' date.
 Pour some milk in a microwavable glass and put it in the microwave for a minute. Observe the hot milk and if it has lumps or becomes gooey, throw it out.

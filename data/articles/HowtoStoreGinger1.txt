 If you want your ginger to last as long as possible, then you have to pick out the freshest ginger root and use it shortly after purchasing. To find the freshest ginger, look for ginger with a fresh and spicy fragrance and a nice smooth skin. The rhizomes of the ginger should feel heavy and firm in your hands. Avoid any ginger that's wrinkled or feels a bit soft, or you'll be eating ginger that's already on the decline.


Avoid any ginger that is wet, moist, or moldy.
Decide whether to store the ginger in the freezer or refrigerator. If you know you'll be using the ginger again soon, then you should just store it in the refrigerator to make it easy to use, peel, or mince the ginger in the future. Ginger can last in the refrigerator for up to three weeks, so if you know you won't be using it before then, then you should store it in the freezer.
You can also mix and match. If you know you'll be using a small chunk of the ginger soon, then you can cut off a chunk and refrigerate it and then freeze the rest of the ginger for use in the more distant future.;

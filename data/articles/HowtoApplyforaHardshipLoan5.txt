 Some institutions offer grants and scholarships that do not require any repayment. For example, if you are planning on going or returning to school, apply to your institution for merit scholarships, which are given based on academic success and do not require any repayment.
 Additionally, if you have a special skill or talent, you can look online for grants that are earmarked to help people with your special skill or talent. For example, if you play violin, its possible for you to find a scholarship specifically for someone who plays violin.


Additionally, there are other scholarships available specifically for women, minorities, and people with underprivileged backgrounds.
There are also many scholarships for people who are the first in their family to attend college.
Though scholarships apply to students, grants are not always tied to education. MacArthur Fellows, for instance, receive no-strings-attached fellowships for work in music, film, and much more.You can also find grants for small businesses and other specific types.

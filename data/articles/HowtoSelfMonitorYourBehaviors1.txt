 It is best to monitor one behavior at a time. This can be anything you choose, from dietary choices to how often you get distracted. Choose the most important/interesting behavior and monitor that first., Quantitative measurements allow you to put a numerical value to your observations. Qualitative measurements depend on experiential evidence. You should favor qualitative measurements whenever possible, as they are more objective and reliable., You can reinforce behaviors that you want to exhibit by building rewards into your plan. Each time you observe yourself behaving the way that you prefer, you reward yourself. Make the reward proportional to the behavior you want to exhibit.For example, an appropriate reward for spending an hour studying could be taking a walk. A weekend out of town would be a more appropriate reward for having made straight Aâ€™s.

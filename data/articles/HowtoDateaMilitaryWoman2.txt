 If your girlfriend is career military, long-distance dating may become a regular part of your relationship. You will have to make peace with her being away, and recognize her service to the country. If you love her, it is likely that her sacrifice is part of your attraction.
 Don’t begin doing anything you wouldn’t do when she is at home. If you normally go out to bars, keep doing that. If not, don’t start. Since this may become a regular part of your relationship, creating stability between times she is here and away is important for both of you. It helps her imagine where you are day-to-day, and helps you cope with her absence.
 One of the best ways to wow your military girlfriend or wife is to make it easy for her to communicate with you and others. Send her phone cards so she doesn’t have to worry about that logistical detail when she's on leave. It’s also a loving and subtle reminder that you are there and ready to talk when she is., Modern technology has made long-distance relationships much more bearable. Calling on the phone is the bare minimum, and video chat is better. Being able to see each other in your respective environments helps you picture each other. Don’t start hating these methods of communication, because they are a part of your life now.


Long-distance relationships have a tendency to reinforce idealized versions of a person in their partner’s head. Seeing each other helps you keep track of little details, like hairstyle changes. Facial expressions are also a better indicator of feelings than voice alone.

 It's safe, easy and free.;
, You can pay for subscription, buy a prepaid card, do surveys/offers (don't usually work), or watch vids. i personally do vids. Also get green points! You get some to start off with, so validate your email to get 500 more, and do various things to get even more!

, Observe what other people with gold points and who are taken are wearing. Another great way is to check out the fame game. Observe the outfits of people with high scores, and the Hall of Fame with past winners (Note: don't enter fame game unless you got the hot gold point look and at least 1000 friends, you'll be wasting 500 green points for absolutely nothing if you don't).
 If it says it's full try somewhere else.
 You could have just asked "wanna go out" and be ok, but now people go "um idk you". So ask a few questions. Their name? Age? (note: 1st name and age should be the only info you ever give). Maybe 1 or 2 of their interests? Then ask "u single" and if they say yes then drop the bomb.
 Remember, no one wants to date someone who ignores him/her. Be on at least twice a day and tell them you love them, maybe give them a gift now and again.

 This means, take some cash with you. Dress comfortably. Chances are, you're going to go through a lot of time looking at used items. Wear some slip on flats (if you're planning on trying on shoes) and a fitted top for trying on clothes over it. Wear a backpack or a cross body bag, so you have both hands free to look around.;
, Whether it's your clothing size or the measurements of the area you want to put the furniture in, you'll always know if something fits or not.
 Most thrift stores will have a half- off- Saturday or any other deal. That way, instead of getting that violet blouse for ten dollars, you can get it for an even better five dollars.
 Is it damaged? Does it have a broken zipper? Does it have a hole in it? Always inspect the garment you're looking at before buying. This is the same for furniture. Look for scratches, dents, chips, and other dis-functions.
 Sure, that orange shirt does have a hole in it. But it would look nice as a scarf. Always remember to think out of the box. Not every item you find will be perfect, but if you try, you will find a way to make it perfect.
 Thrift shopping can be amazing, and even if you didn't get anything, you still can have a day out with your pals.

 If you have versions 4 or 5, proceed to disable your autofill. (You can check the version by clicking on "Safari" in the browser bar, letting the menu drop down, then clicking on "About Safari". A box will pop up showing you your current version.);
,, The autofill box will open out in your browser.
 In the autofill box, uncheck the box marked "Using info from my Address Book card".
 If you want, check to see that it worked by opening the autofill box one more time. The unchecked box should remain that way.

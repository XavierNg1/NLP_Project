Clicking on the film reel icon located in the bottom, left corner of Final Cut Pro will open your Project Library.

You may also use the key strokes of "Command-Comma" to open the Preferences window.

The changes you make to this field will affect how your Timecode appears in the Dashboard of your Final Cut Pro project.
The Dashboard is the section where the Timecode will be located in the top, middle section of your open project session.
You can choose to add a basic Timecode with hours, minutes, and seconds or a Timecode with hours minutes, seconds, and sub-frames, which is the smallest unit of audio at a fraction of one one-hundredth of a single frame.
You can also add Timecode that only displays the duration of time in seconds, or the duration of time in frames.

Type a numeric time-stamp for each field located in your Timecode. For example, if your Timecode displays just hours, minutes, and seconds, and you want to make edits exactly 30 minutes and 45 seconds into the video, type 003045 and press the "Enter" key on your keyboard.
You can also use the keyboard shortcut command of "Control-P" to enter the time instead of clicking inside the Dashboard.



Type in the exact amount of time you want the Playhead to move forward or backward. For example, if you are editing a spot of your video, and you now want to edit a section of your video exactly 30 seconds ahead of your current spot, press the "plus" symbol and type in 30 to move the Playhead ahead 30 seconds.
The Playhead is the small arrow in the shape of a triangle that moves along with your video as it plays.

 You need to override your dog's distaste for his medicine by offering him something he finds irresistible. Make sure to choose foods that are healthy for your dog, like plain meat, cheese, peanut butter, or yogurt. Avoid junk foods like candy or chips.


This works best if your dog swallows food quickly, without chewing.
This works best with food in which the pill can be well enveloped, so that the pill does not fall out.
Using pill pockets available at your veterinarian sometimes works better than food.;
, There are different ways of doing this, depending on the kind of food you use. Generally, the goal is to fold the pill inside, or push it into the food, such that it is securely hidden. Try different ways of hiding the pill in the food to see what works best for your dog.


Ground beef, turkey or chicken can be molded around the medication.
Pills can be pushed inside a portion of hot dog.
Softer cheeses can be easily re-shaped to encapsulate the medicine.
 This can take a few tries. Sometimes dogs are able to separate the medicine from the food in their mouths, and they will then spit it out. In this case, try again. If you are repeatedly unsuccessful, it may be necessary to try another method.


You may want to try to wait until the dog is hungry, and then give two or three undoctored treats so that the dog gets a taste for them and looks for more. Then slip in the doctored treat, closely followed by another normal treat to get the taste out of his mouth.
If you have more than one dog, try this when they are both present. Give food without medicine to the other dog first. Then attempt to give the medicine. The competition from the second dog can increase the chances of successfully getting your dog to take the bait.

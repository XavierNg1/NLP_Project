 The first sign is often the smell and that "d'oh!" moment as you realize you have forgotten the cake! Try the following fixes before tossing it.;
, Do this with care and only if the cake is slightly burned. Cut the base and edges off and cover with frosting or icing.


If a cake is severely burnt, don't try this, as the burnt taste will have permeated the whole cake.
 Rub the strainer against the burned surface. This will remove all the charred bits without having to cut or break the cake.
 Carry a timer with you if you are forgetful and wander off.


To prevent the cake burning on the top, cut out two circles of baking or parchment paper larger than the cake pan. Sit these over the top of the cake before placing it in the oven for baking.

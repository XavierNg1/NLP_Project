 Wash your hair before you go to bed, shampooing and conditioning as normal. If you do not want to completely wash your hair, spritz it until it is damp with a spray bottle full of water.

Towel dry your hair once you come out of the shower so that it is not dripping wet.
 Divide your hair into several sections, starting at your natural part and working out. Loosely twist each section from the root down to the tips.

Divide your hair into more sections depending upon its thickness. Thinner hair will likely two or three pairs of curling rods. Thicker hair may use four or five.
 Wrap your hair around the length of the rods the same way you would wrap it around a curling iron. The tighter your wrap them, the tighter your crimp will be.

Start with at least four pairs of rods for medium-textured, shoulder-length hair. Longer or thicker hair may need six or more.
Secure the rod pairs by bending inward to hold them in place against your head. Try to secure them as high on your head as possible.
Curling rods are available affordably at most drug stores and beauty supply stores.
 Go to bed with the curling rods in. Allow your hair to dry around the rods while you sleep.If the curlers make you uncomfortable while you sleep, adjust them toward the top of your head and away from your pillow.
 When you wake up, gently remove the rollers and slip your hair off of the rollers. Shake your curls out with your fingers. Then, style your hair as you would like. Keep the crimps tighter by minimizing finger brushing. If you want softer, fuller curls, finger brush your hair more.
Use a bit of mousse or hairspray to help hold your curls. Finish with a bit of anti-frizz serum or a shine spray.

 Things that lead to resentment are usually small things that can be dealt with easily. Once you deal with resentment, make a vow to each other to share your problems, hurts, and concerns with each other.This allows you and your spouse to deal with a small problem before it starts to ruin the relationship.
 Sometimes, resentment comes from not spending enough time together. Life can get hectic, especially when you have kids and demanding careers. To help minimize the resentment and keep it from occurring in the future, you and your spouse need to focus on making your marriage a priority.For example, take one night a week to have a date. You may choose to go out to dinner and movie, have someone watch the kids while you eat dinner together at home, or just curl up on the couch and watch television together.
Spend a few minutes each day talking to one another. Ask about each otherâ€™s days and listen while your spouse talks. Make sure to put up all electronic devices when this happens and just focus on each other.
 As you are dealing with your resentment, you should figure out what things cause you to start to feel resentment. This could be feeling hungry, upset, lonely, tired, or stressed out. If you feel these things, you can acknowledge these feelings and then let them go.You might also have triggers about things that your spouse does. This might be certain phrases that your spouse utters, actions your spouse does, things they forget, or ways they treat you.
It would be helpful if you and your spouse worked to identify your own triggers. You could then work on them one by one.

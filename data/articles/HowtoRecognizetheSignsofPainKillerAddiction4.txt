 Painkillers not only mask physical pain, but they can numb emotional pain as well. This makes coming off of the painkillers an extremely emotional process for some people. You should be prepared to cope with these emotions, and a counselor can help teach coping mechanisms as well as listen to your needs.
 A support group is generally made up of a mediator that leads the conversation, and members that are going through similar struggles. By realizing that you are not alone in your struggle, you can overcome the isolation that seems to exist for someone struggling with addiction. Support groups can also be a place to hear inspiring success stories.
 Your doctor can help you adjust the dose of your painkillers to slowly bring you off of the drugs. They can also prescribe other, less addictive drugs that can help you move past the need for painkillers. Also, ask your doctor for recommendations to counselors that specialize in drug addiction.
 If you have a friend or family member that you think is addicted to painkillers, you may feel that there is little you can do to help. While it is true that you cannot make the person seek help, you can give them the tools they need to overcome their addiction when they are ready. Point out to them that they can confide in their doctor, counselor, or a support group. Friends and family are also a support system, so be aware of what you are doing to support your loved one during the course of the addiction.

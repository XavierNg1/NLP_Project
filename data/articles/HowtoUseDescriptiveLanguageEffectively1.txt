 Who are you writing to? Your audience and topic are the two factors which will dictate what is "good" or "bad" when writing.;
, Whether it is a thing or a process, you'll need to understand it before you can describe it. Observe the topic, pictures of it, or videos of it.
 Write "____ is: ....." You can skip this step if you have already written a sentence or have one in mind.
 Always ask yourself "why is this here?" You need to keep track of what your audience knows and what they may need to be told or reminded of.
 Concision and accuracy are your objectives. Unfortunately they also contradict. You must remain as concise as possible, but you also need to describe as thoroughly as possible. This is why scientific and academic writing is "dense." Its object is to get a point across, not to be fun to read.
 Try to get a feel for whether they need something more concise or more detailed. Everyone has a different preference. If the writing is for school, ask the teacher about it. Run specific sentences by them if you can and ask them for their opinion. Once you understand what they want writing for them will be easier.
 Leave the writing alone for an hour, a day, a week, then a month if you can. But leave it at least for a day.
 How does it sound? Try to listen for anything jarring or awkward. Add, remove, or change as necessary.
 If you feel that you have described something thoroughly and in the most concise way as possible, then don't second guess yourself.

, There are a variety of factors that can cause inflammation of your cat’s nose or nasal passages, leading to a stuffy nose. Common causes include tumors inside the nose, a foreign object lodged in the nasal passages, parasites, fungal infections, dental abscess, and bacterial or viral infections., The herpes virus and calicivirus cause a large percentage of stuffy noses. Signs of these viral infections include discharge from both nostrils that is clear or cloudy, as well as discharge from the eyes., If you suspect your cat’s stuffy nose is caused by a common upper respiratory infection, you can just let the illness run its course. Most of these infections are short in duration and will clear up on their own within seven to ten days., You can help your cat manage its stuffy nose by making sure its nose is clean. Wet a cotton ball with water and use it to gently wipe away any mucus from your cat’s nose. Do this several times a day while your cat has a stuffy nose., If your cat is chronically congested, steam therapy can help. The warm vapor may help loosen mucus in your cat’s nose and nasal passages, making it easier for them to breathe. Try taking your cat into the bathroom and closing the door. Turn a hot shower on for about 10 minutes and sit in the room with your cat during this time., If your cat is having trouble breathing, you should make an appointment with your vet. A veterinarian can examine your pet and determine why it has a stuffy nose. The vet will perform a dental exam, blood work, and/or a physical examination to determine the cause of your cat’s stuffy nose.

 There are a number of possible pi pie ideas you can make besides the pumpkin pie. For starters, you could always buy the pumpkin pie ready made and simply attach a piped cream or custard pi to it. Here are some more ideas:

Chocolate pi pie. Simply pipe cream or custard to create the pi symbol on the pie. Naturally, this can be done on any kind of pie you prefer.

Apple pi pie. Simply cut out the pi symbol as shown in the image. The steam will escape through this hole, leaving you with a perfect pi pie.
Covered pi pie. Any pie can be made this way, savory or sweet, whatever your favorite filling is. Simply cut out the pi symbol and attach with egg yolk so that it bakes on during the baking process advised by your recipe.
Savory pi pie. Anything you'd like can go inside ready-made puff pastry and once again, simply cut out the pi symbol from the puff pastry and attach with egg yolk to the pie top.
Make a Shepherd's Pi Pie (or Cottage Pi Pie, if you prefer it) by topping your favorite recipe with a pi symbol piped onto the top using extra mashed potatoes through a cake-decorating icing bag, or decorating the top after baking with a pi symbol made of chopped fresh parsley,
For the super un-enthused baker, just scratch the pi symbol into the pie!
For the super enthused baker, go all out and bake a book pi pie! Note: if you make a Pi Cobbler in a large, rectangular pan, you can include more numbersâ€”and impress more math geeks with your cleverness.

 A cold shower will make you feel more alert, but it will not minimize the effects of alcohol. On the contrary, a cold shower may send your body into shock if you are severely intoxicated or have alcohol poisoning., Like a cold shower, a cup of coffee will only make you feel more alert. Contrary to popular belief, it does not sober you up or reduce the level of alcohol in your blood.Coffee can also add to dehydration. So drinking coffee to sober up may worsen your hangover the next morning.
 This tactic will not work unless you do it immediately after taking a shot. Once the alcohol is absorbed into your system, i.e., when you feel buzzed, it is too late. At this point you are only doing your body a disservice since vomiting depletes your body and adds to dehydration.

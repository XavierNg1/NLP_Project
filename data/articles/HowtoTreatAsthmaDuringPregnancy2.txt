 It is considered safer for pregnant asthmatic women to be treated with asthma medications than to experience asthma symptoms without treatment. The specific type and strength of medication will vary from person to person, and must be determined with your healthcare provider(s).Medications are divided into two categories:


Long-term-control medications – These daily medications suppress and control inflammation
Quick relief medications – These “as needed” medications treat acute symptoms and exacerbations.
Often asthma patients are prescribed both types.
 This approach requires ongoing monitoring and communication with your doctor., When you have achieved asthma control, and sustained this for several months, your doctor may encourage you to step down to less intensive therapy. In pregnant patients, this step down should be taken slower and with extra caution. In some cases, your doctor may choose to postpone this step until after your baby is born.

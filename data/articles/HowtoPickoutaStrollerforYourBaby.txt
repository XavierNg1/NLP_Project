 It's better to have a stroller that lasts through the wear and tear of multiple children than to have to buy a new one every time. If you plan on having another child soon, consider a multiple occupancy stroller.;
, Practice putting a doll in the stroller and make sure it's not only comfortable for the baby, but also easy for you. You don't want a belt system so complicated that you'll have to spend 15 minutes fiddling with it or worse, you'll stop using it because it's too much of a hassle.
, Most strollers have adjustable handles but if you're especially short or tall, you'll want to double check.

 During a depressive episode, it may be hard for the person to accomplish large goals, so setting small manageable goals may help.Accomplishing a small goal may also help the person feel better.


For example, if the person is complaining that she needs to clean her whole house, then you might suggest just tackling something small like a coat closet or bathroom.
 When someone is depressed, it may be tempting to turn to negative coping mechanisms, such as alcohol, isolating oneself, or not taking medications. Instead, try to encourage the person to use positive coping mechanisms.For example, you can suggest calling is or her therapist, doing a little exercise, or engaging in a hobby when a depressive mood strikes.
 Encouraging the person during depressive phases will help him or her to know that someone is there who cares. Make sure that you avoid making promises or relying on clichés when you encourage your friend or the person.


For example, don’t say, “Everything will be fine,” “It’s all in your head,” or “When life give you lemons, make lemonade!”Instead, say things like, “I care about you,” “I am here for you,” “You are a good person and I am happy that you are in my life.”, During depressive phases of your/the person’s disorder, he or she may prefer to stay in bed, isolate themselves, or just watch TV all day do your best to help the person establish a daily routine so that he or she always has something to do.For example, you might establish a time for your the person to get up and shower, a time to go get the mail, a time to take a walk, and time to do something fun, like reading a book or playing a game.
 During depressive phases, people are more prone to thoughts of suicide. Make sure that you take any comments about suicide seriously.If the person is acting suicidal or indicating that he or she has plans to kill herself and/or harm others, then call emergency services for help. Do not try to deal with someone who is suicidal or violent on your own.

 A crossing turn passes the free end of your line around itself so that it continues away from your already secured end of the rope, forming a loop. Do this twice, and be sure to leave yourself extra line in each turn so both form loops large enough for your rope to pass through., Take a few inches of your rope from the line after the crossing turns and pull it through both loops. Leave enough line after the second of your two crossing turns so that when you tighten your line there are loops both above and below the turns., Just as you'd do with a normal trucker's hitch, you'll want to take your line around an anchor point and bring it back to the free end oriented part of your knot. Pass your line through the loop there and pull tight.This modified trucker's hitch is good for light to moderate tension, but it is susceptible to failure under extreme duress. You might want to choose a different knot for especially heavy loads., Just as you would do for a normal trucker's hitch, you can create simple locks (also called hitches) in the line at the free end oriented part of your knot. Simply take your free end around the double strands of your line at the base of the knot and...


Leave enough slack in your line to form a loop. Take your free end through the loop and pull it tight, sliding the lock to meet the base of your knot.
Repeat this process, threading your line through the loop so it emerges from between the locks. Pull your second lock tight and slide it so it is next to the first. Your modified trucker's hitch is ready for business!

 AKA the Inland Taipan, the Fierce Snake has the reputation of being the most deadly snake on the planet. Its venom is more potent than any other species by far, and yet—there's no record of a human fatality caused by the Fierce Snake.


This bad boy can reach a length of over 6 feet (1.8 m), and varies in color from dark brown to a light straw. It's darker in the winter than it is in the summer. It's head can appear almost black.
It lives in the black soil plains where Queensland, South Australia, and the Northern Territory borders meet.
 Unlike the most venomous snake, the Inland Taipan, the Eastern Brown Snake is responsible for the most snakebite deaths in Australia. Like all snakes, they would much rather slither away than attack, but if they are threatened, or grabbed, or stepped on, all bets are off.


They can exceed 6 feet (2m) in length, and are very fast—especially on hot days. They're slender, with a variable color ranging from tan to gray or dark brown. Their belly is lighter, and has darker orange spots.
They inhabit eastern Australia, from the desert to the coast, and prefer open grasslands, pastures, and woodland.
Needless to say, if you're bitten by one of these snakes, get help immediately!

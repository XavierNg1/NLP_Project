 Camps like to have staff in place well before summer sessions begin, often before registration. Some even begin hiring during the winter. Therefore, if you know you want a summer camp job, you should start looking as early as possible. Doing so will give you more options and increase your chances of landing a desirable job.;
, If you have a specific location in mind, conduct a search for camps in that general area. Use your favorite internet search engine and enter the keywords “summer camp” and the name of your desired area. When this information pops up, you can make a list of possibilities and do some research on them.
 If the camp has a website, you can gain all kinds of valuable information by spending some time there. Read as much as possible. Some basic information to consider:


camp culture
camp mission
programs available
session dates and times
special requirements for employment (minimum age, experience, or certifications)
available jobs

, If there is no camp website (or if the website offers minimal information), call the camp to speak with a representative and request that a brochure be mailed to you.
 Counselors and educators sometimes have lists of camps in your area based on their specialties (for example, robotics camp for future engineers). They may be personally familiar with some of these camps, or they may have worked at some of them. These people can therefore me excellent resources – ask them for recommendations!

, While you are asking for camp recommendations, be sure to discuss your strengths, weaknesses, and long-term goals. These people may be able to make better recommendations if they have all of this information. For example, if you are on the swim team and are lifeguard certified, your counselor may recommend that you apply for an instructor position at a swim camp.

 Oil is supposed to soften the spray paint on the hands, while a quick abrasive starts the general process of removal. In fact, oil is such a popular way of removing paint from skin that many different oils are now used; sample one of the oil methods suggested under this section.
 Cover the area with baby oil for one to two minutes, and then begin gently wiping with your cloth. Repeat as necessary.
 Squirt some into the palms of your hands. Rub it onto the spray paint. Leave for 3 minutes, then wash off with ordinary soap and water.
 Dilute some of the essential oil in water, cover hands with oil, and wait for one to two minutes. Begin gently wiping hands with cloth, repeating as necessary.
 Apply a generous amount of olive oil to the hands and set stand for several minutes. Use coarse-grained salt like Kosher or sea salt to begin rubbing between hands. Repeat as necessary.
 Mayonnaise is a simple emulsification of oil and eggs, meaning that this method — like the method above — is all natural. Simply coat the hands with ample mayonnaise and let stand for several minutes. Wipe off with water and a towel. This method should make your hands feel smooth and hydrated.
 Work the butter or margarine into your hands for at least a minute. Then, use coarse salt (Kosher or sea salt) as an abrasive to fully remove the paint. Since your hands will be greasy and oily afterward, wash thoroughly with a gentle soap and rinse.

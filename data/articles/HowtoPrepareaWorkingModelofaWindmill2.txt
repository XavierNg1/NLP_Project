 Before starting the project, wash and dry your tin can thoroughly. Measure the can’s circumference and evenly divide the can into 6 or 8 lengthwise parts—these will become the blades of your windmill. Use a permanent marker to mark these segments on the can., Put on your safety goggles and gloves. Use your scissors to carefully cut along the outline of each blade. Stop cutting ½ in from the bottom of the can., With your gloved hands, carefully bend each blade down towards the surface you are working on. Retrieve your hammer. Place the tin can on the ground and gently tap each blade until it is flat., Keep your gloves on and grab the sandpaper. Slowly run the paper over the front and back surface of the can. Pay particular attention to sanding the edges.Sanding the can will allow the paint to adhere to the surface.
 Spread newspaper or cardboard on the ground. Place the tin can on the covered surface. Put on your protective mask. Spray a thin layer of paint over the blades and center of the tin can. Allow the paint to dry before applying 2 coats of polyurethane spray., Retrieve the dowel. Lay the tin can windmill on top of the wooden dowel. The dowel should intersect the tin can blade’s center., Hold the wooden dowel in place—ask a friend or an adult to help. Tap a nail through the center of the tin can and into the wooden dowel. Wiggle the nail around to create a larger hole. This will allow the blades to turn.

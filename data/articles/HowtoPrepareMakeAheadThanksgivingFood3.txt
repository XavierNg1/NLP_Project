 To start, you should bake your bread cubes at 225 degrees Fahrenheit (about 107 degrees Celsius). Spread them over a large baking sheet. Bake them for about 90 minutes or until they're crisp. Check on the bread cubes every half hour and stir them., Take a heavy skillet and use it to heat your butter over medium-high heat. Place the onions, celery, and garlic in the skillet first. Cook them until the vegetables are soft, which should take about 10 minutes. Stir them frequently when cooking.Add the sage and thyme once the vegetables are soft. Stir the mixture for about two more minutes. Turn off the heat and set the vegetables aside.
 In a small mixing bowl, beat together your eggs with the broth, salt, and pepper. Add a generous amount of black pepper. Use a wire whisk or fork to beat until everything is a uniform mixture., Placed the cooked vegetables and bread crumbs in a large bowl. Use a mixing spoon to fold them together.Pour the egg and broth mixture into your bowl. Stir until everything is mixed evenly.
 Lightly grease the baking dish first. It should be able to hold three quarts. Transfer your stuffing into the bowl. You can cover the dish in foil and place it in the refrigerator. It will keep for about 24 hours., You should heat your stuffing at an oven preheated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (about 190 degrees Celsius). Bake it covered for about 25 minutes before removing the foil.Return your dish to the oven. Allow the stuffing to bake for about 15 more minutes or until the top is golden brown.
You should let the stuffing cool for 10 minutes before serving it.

 It doesn't matter what brand you use. Just be sure that it is fully emptied. Don't waste the water for this experiment.


Give the water to some plants if you're not thirsty.
 Most households carry these two products, but you can also purchase some if you can't find any. For the vinegar, it's best to use the cheap, white distilled vinegar.
 Use about two tablespoons of vinegar and baking soda. Mix the two ingredients in the bottle. These products will immediately react from coming into contact with one another. This chemical reaction is the fuel for the rocket.
 You'll need to be quick when you cap the water bottle. Careful not to let any of the combination out when you're sealing the lid on. The plastic water bottle will start to expand once capped. This will create the necessary tension required for the rocket to fly.








For greater tension, shake your bottle up. Don't over-shake the bottle because it could explode in your hand.
Make sure that people around you are keeping their distance from the water bottle. This method creates more of an explosion based rocket, so it can be a little dangerous.
 This can be a dangerous step if you haven't took the proper safety steps. Make sure everyone you are with is not standing nearby. Throw it onto cement and aim for the plastic lid. The plastic lid should explode from the impact causing your rocket to shoot into the sky.








This is not the most secure way of creating a rocket, but the effect is similar to the other approach of creating a bottle rocket.
This is an easier technique that needs to be treated with more precautions.
Safety first!

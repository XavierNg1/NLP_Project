 Trust me: wearing inappropriate clothes will NOT attract guys, especially in school. Wear skinny jeans, a flirty blouse (or a conversation-starting T-shirt), a pair of sandals or sneakers, and pull back your hair. You can braid it, don't just pull it in a pony-tail.;
, Making him jealous is good, if he likes you he will get jealous.
 Ignoring him is not a good thing, but occasionally a "Hi, |insert name|, how are you?" But completely ignoring him won't attract his attention towards you.
 "Can we be friends?" (yea, sure) "Oh, can I please have your phone number or email so I can stay in touch on weekends" (gives number/email).
 Say you have his email. Send him an email saying something like you miss him and can't wait to see him next time. Don't be TOO flirty, but be generously nice. Send winks and stuff too, once you get more comfortable.
 Once you flirt with him, if he is interested, he may ask you first; but if he doesn't, either way: ask him on a date. The school dance, the movies, any festival or something you both are interested in. E.g: Comic Con, Fair, Racing, anything.
 Or, you can tell him that you like him. Either way, it is going to come out that you like him.
 If he says yes, you are officially dating!

, But play hard to get. Here's how: he should call YOU. NEVER call a boy. Miss a few calls, or wait a while to respond to texts. DON'T make excuses. If you miss a call, don't say "I am sorry, sweetie. I was asleep." Instead, say nothing at all. Flirt with other guys, but don't lose your relationship.
 Hint a kiss, or, the easy way: Grab him by his shirt and kiss him. Just like in movies, this is a good move to make. It happens so fast he won't know what happened, except for he enjoyed it.

 Condition scoring is a process in which you assess the amount of fat the horse has on it. Condition scoring requires that you look at and feel the horse's body and assess the amount of fat it is carrying in specific areas. With condition scoring, you can evaluate whether the horse is in ideal condition or not.Once you look at and feel an area, you will write down your assessment in a chart made specifically for condition scoring.
Condition scoring can take some instruction and practice, so you may want to consult with your veterinarian for some guidance on the procedure.
A horse needs some fat to get it through the winter but it shouldn't have so much fat on it that it becomes obese.;
, A weight tape is a tool used to approximate a horse's weight. It is a measuring tape that is wrapped around a horse's back and chest and the measurement markings are in pounds or kilograms.Using a weight tape will not give you a completely accurate measurement. It is only an estimate. It is best used for assessing change over time.
 If you are bringing your horse to a veterinary clinic or a center that has a horse scale, then you can have the horse actually weighed. However, this is not usually available to horse owners on a regular basis.Using a scale is the most accurate way to weigh a horse.

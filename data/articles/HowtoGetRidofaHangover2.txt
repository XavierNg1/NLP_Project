 Eggs are an excellent thing to eat to combat a hangover. They contain an amino acid called cysteine, which your body will be very happy to receive after a bout of drinking. Cysteine works to break down the toxins that make you feel unwell after drinking. By helping cleanse your body of these leftover toxins, eggs can help you to feel better, rejuvenated, and more energized.Avoid preparing your eggs with too much fat or grease, as this could make you feel nauseated.
 If the thought of eggs makes your stomach turn, try a bowl of fortified breakfast cereal. Whole grain cereal is preferable, as it will have more vitamins and nutrients., A bouillon soup is a thin broth that is based on vegetables. It’s a good source of the vitamins and minerals you need to replenish when you’re hungover. It’s also perfect if you are feeling very fragile and might struggle to keep down solid foods.Bouillon soup can particularly help you to replace salt and potassium., When you are drinking you will find yourself making regular trips to the bathroom, due to the fact that alcohol’s a diuretic. When you are urinating a lot you will lose more potassium than normal. Lower potassium levels contribute to tiredness, nausea and weak limbs, all symptoms of a hangover. To tackle this eat foods that are good sources of potassium.


Two cheap, easy to find examples you might already have in your kitchen are bananas and kiwi fruits.Baked potatoes, leafy greens, mushrooms, and dried apricots are also good sources of potassium.Sports drinks are often good sources of potassium., Eating bland foods may be the best option if your stomach is feeling sensitive. The point of eating to tackle a hangover is not to "absorb" the alcohol, but to boost your blood sugar and replenish nutrients.Alcohol prevents your body from maintaining normal blood sugar concentration, and low blood sugar leads to fatigue and weakness, making your body tired..
Complex carbohydrates (oatmeal, whole-grain bread) are good choices.

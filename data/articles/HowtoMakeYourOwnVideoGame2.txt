 The design document is the backbone of your video game. It contains detailed descriptions of your game’s mechanics, plot, setting, aesthetic design and more. The format of the document is not as important as the content.


Design documents are especially important if you are managing a team of programmers and artists. Make sure that the document is geared toward them, and not towards the end consumer. Avoid being vague and go into great detail as to how each of the game’s mechanics should work.
Not every game has a design document, and no two design documents will look alike. Use these steps as a guideline, but feel free to tailor your document to your game’s needs.
 Every single aspect of the game needs to be addressed in the table of contents. The only thing that doesn't need to be included is the story, unless the story is fundamentally connected to the mechanics of the game.Approach the table of contents in a similar way as you would a game manual. Start with broad sections, such as Character Creation, Combat, and Main Interface, and then flesh each one of these sections out with subsections.
Think of the table of contents as an outline for the game. You will be going into much more detail for each entry in the table

, After you have the table laid out, start expanding on the mechanics. Take the time to go into detail so that there is no confusion when you start programming. Each mechanic should be fully explained, so that there is no confusion when it comes time to implement it.
 Depending on your approach, game design can be a very collaborative process. Insight from others can help keep your game focused, and can point out areas that aren't as well thought-out.

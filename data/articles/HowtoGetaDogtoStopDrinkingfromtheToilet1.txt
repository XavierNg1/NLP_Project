 The best way to train your dog to stop doing anything is to catch it in the act. Once you hear your dog slurping from the toilet or you see it drinking out of the toilet, it is your chance to act.Because dogs have short attention spans, it is pointless to reprimand your dog after the fact. You will need to catch your dog in the act in order to correct the behavior.;
, Once you hear or see your dog drinking from the toilet, call it away from the toilet. Make sure you say “no” or “stop” when you catch your dog in the act. This will reinforce the idea that drinking from the toilet is an undesired behavior. Your tone of voice should be serious and calm.You can say, “No, Fido. I do not want you drinking from the toilet. Come here,” or “Stop, Fido. Do not drink from the toilet. Come here.”

, If your dog ceases drinking from the toilet when called and/or reprimanded, close the toilet lid. Make sure your dog sees and hears you closing the toilet lid. Closing the toilet lid will further reinforce the idea that you do not want it drinking from the toilet., After you have reprimanded your dog, redirect its behavior. Bring your dog to the kitchen and give it a fresh bowl of water. Verbally and physically praise your dog for drinking from its water bowl.For example, while petting your dog say, “Good boy (or girl)” in a praising tone.
To further solidify the behavior, reward your dog with a treat for drinking out of its water bowl.

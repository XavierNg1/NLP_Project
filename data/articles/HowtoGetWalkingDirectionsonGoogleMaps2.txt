 Look for the Google Maps app on your mobile device and tap on it.
 Use the search box on the upper left corner of the page and type in your destination location or address. A shortlist of possible results will drop down. Tap on your destination, and the map will automatically draw you to the location you’ve set.
 Go back to the section on the upper left corner of the page. The destination you’ve set is displayed there. Tap it, and new field will appear where you can type in your starting location or address.


Tap the field and type in your starting location. A shortlist of possible results will drop down. Tap on the starting location, and you will be shown the best transportation method and route from your starting location to your destination, with the total distance and time. Most of the time this will be via car or rail, since these are the faster options.
 Since you’re planning on walking, tap on the pedestrian icon on the toolbar above the section on the upper left corner of the page.
 You may be given several options on routes you can take, each identified with its own duration and distance.
 From the routes provided, tap the one you’d like to use. The route will be displayed in color on the map. The street-by-street directions from your starting location to your destination will be listed.


Each step will clearly indicate the direction you have to take, on which street you should be on, and the distance you have to walk.

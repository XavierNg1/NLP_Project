 Like complaining, gossiping does hold some social value. Throughout history, humans have relied on gossip for safety, using it as a means of learning who is or is not trustworthy.But chronic gossip about other people can be distracting and can damage reputations in the workplace.


Gossip about coworkers can hurt feelings, lower workplace morale, and can even lead to lawsuits for defamation or invasion of privacy.
 If a coworker is known to spread rumors and gossip about others, revealing virtually anything about yourself could give that coworker fuel to start a new rumor.
 If you know that a coworker is spreading gossip about you, or is even lying about you, try using humor to diffuse the situation.Do not confront your coworker with anger. This may lead to escalation or retaliation.
Address the issue your coworker is talking about, but state the facts.
Try saying something like, "I worry people might think certain things about me, but it's just not true," or "I heard someone say something about that, but it wasn't me."

, If other people are gossiping about a coworker, it's best not to get involved. And if others are gossiping about you, try not to let it bother you. Chances are they will get bored and move on to some other topic shortly.

 Spruce them up in readiness for attending the picnic:;
,

Refurbish your teddy bear.

Sew a teddy bear if you don't have a teddy bear, or enough of them to make a picnic.
If your kids are already in on the picnic, have them make their bears a teddy bear suitcase to keep them busy in the background.
 No Teddy Bear's picnic would be complete without the right food. Don't forget that bears love honey and other things sweet! Some ideas of what to make or buy include:


Sandwiches
Salad (use "bear paw" servers to serve it with)
Cupcakes
Honey cake
Teddy bear shaped crackers (and teach your kids how to dunk a teddy bear biscuit in milk).
 Make sure to include plates, cups, utensils and picnic rugs to sit on.
 Even the adults can have some fun but it's mainly for the kids, so have some little "bear prizes" ready for the winners:


Hold a competition for the best-dressed bear.
Hold a competition for the smallest and tallest bears.
Hold a competition for best-named bear.
Play hide and seek with the bears. The rules are up to you!
Have the kids play act being a bear.

Play Look Out for the Bear.



Paint bear paws on the children's faces.

Make a Bear out of Clay.
Read bear stories.
 It will help prevent tears and complaints and you can lay it on thick, asking the children to look after their tired teddies!

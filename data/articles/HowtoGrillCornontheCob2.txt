 The aluminum foil will keep the corn hot for a long time. If you're grilling for a large party, grill foil-wrapped corn first, then leave them wrapped while you finish the rest of your cooking.
 Some cooks like to soak their corn before grilling. If you choose to soak your corn, completely immerse the whole corn cobs in a pot or bowl of cold water for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. This allows the corn kernels to soak up additional moisture, making them plump and juicy. Once they've finished soaking, pat off excess moisture with a paper towel.
 Starting at the top, strip all the husks and silks away from the ears of corn and discard them. If there's any dirt on the kernels, rinse it off.
 Preheat your barbecue grill to a medium high heat, about 350–400 °F (177–204 °C).
 Brush the kernels with butter or olive oil and season with salt and pepper, or these gourmet options. Roll each corn cob in a square of aluminum foil, twisting the ends to secure, like a candy wrapper.


If you prefer, you can wait on the butter and herbs until the corn is cooked.
 Place each aluminum-wrapped ear of corn on the preheated grill/ Cover and allow to cook for approximately 15-20 minutes. Turn occasionally, using a kitchen tongs, to prevent the corn from charring on one side.


You can test if the corn is done by piercing a kernel with a fork. It should feel tender and shoot out clear liquid.
 Remove the corn from the grill using oven gloves or tongs. Carefully remove the aluminum foil; it will be very hot! Serve the corn immediately.

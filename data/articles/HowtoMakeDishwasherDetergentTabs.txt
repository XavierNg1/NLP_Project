 Everything can go in at once and mix well (ingredients will clump when they are fully combined):


2 cups washing or baking soda
2 cups Borax
1/2 cup Kosher or Epsom salt
1/2 cup white vinegar
15 to 20 drops of lemon essential oil;
, Press down until the entire tray is packed hard and solidly.


Keep adding mixture to each tray and pack down. The recipe is designed to hold all the ingredients in both trays.
 In order for the tabs to do their magic, they must be completely dry, which could take at least 24 hours.

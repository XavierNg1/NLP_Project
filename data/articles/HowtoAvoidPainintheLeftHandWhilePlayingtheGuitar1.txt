 The strength of your muscles is secondary to the flexibility and agility of your muscles. One way to improve the latter two attributes is by properly stretching your fingers before practice. Bend back each finger until it feels comfortable and hold them in that position for several seconds. Do the same for each thumb, but also stretch your thumb into your palm.


Get the blood flowing through your fingers by pretending to type rapidly in the air.
Roll your wrests both clockwise and counterclockwise.
Spread your fingers out into a fully extended position, then release the tension.;
, After stretching out your hand, you can strengthen the muscles you commonly use during guitar play. There are two main exercises you can do without playing the guitar itself. Work out the extensor muscles of your fretting hand with these two exercises:


First hold your left hand (or fretting hand) in a relaxed position. Extend your thumb to your pinky and then pull them apart slightly. Continue this motion with the rest of your fingers: ring, middle, and then your index finger. Repeat as many times as you want, but donâ€™t over-exercise your muscles.
Hold your fretting hand relaxed with your palm facing up. Extend your pinky finger slightly and then flex it. Continue the same exercise with the rest of your fingers: ring, middle, and then your index finger., After properly warming up your hand, you can practice a few lines on your guitar. Set a metronome, if available, to a comfortable tempo. For beginners, use 80 bpm, and experienced players can play at around 120 bpm. Set your hand so your index finger is on the first fret. Then play this chromatic riff across each string: 1-2-3-4. Use an individual finger to play each fret.


For an added exercise, do the same motion in a descending order. Start with your pinky on the fourth fret of the last string.
This technique will exercise each finger.Once you become comfortable performing this exercise, increase the speed of your metronome.

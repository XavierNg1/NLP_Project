 Asking friends for life is only possible if your Facebook account is connected to Candy Crush. Click on the connect button on the Candy Crush home screen.
 This will allow the game to contact your friends when you want more lives, or boosters, but will not post status updates on your behalf. This will also sync your gameplay with your Facebook account so you can play Candy Crush on Facebook as well and still see the progress synced with your phone app.
You will see the following three screens after you give permission.
 Once you’ve gone through the process of connecting your Facebook and Candy Crush account, you need to click on the "Ask Friends" button to get them to send you extra lives when you run out.
 You’ll see a page giving you a list of your Facebook friends. Choose the ones you want to ask for extra lives. Remember that you can’t have more than 5 lives at a time, so there’s no need to ask 20 people as you won’t be able to use all those lives together. It’s more recommended to ask a few friends at a time, rather than spamming their accounts with requests every day.

 Empty peanut shells make great impromptu glitter bombs. They are lightweight, portable, and easy to add to small packages. You will need:


A bag of unshelled peanuts
Scissors
Glitter (different colors)
Hot glue gun and sticks
Acrylic paint (optional)
Paint brushes (optional)

, Use scissors to carefully crack the peanuts. Place the peanut lengthwise between the blades of the scissors and gently apply pressure. Once the peanut splits, use your fingers to separate the two halves and remove the nut from the shell.Repeat until you have your desired number of “peanut glitter bomb” cartridges. Make sure you keep associated shell halves together.


Discard peanuts that develop any cracks.
 Place associated shell halves next to one another and fill one side with glitter. Repeat until all shell halves are filled.
 Apply hot glue to the edges of the shell half with the glitter. Position the half without glitter so the edges line-up with the glue and press the two halves together. Let the glue dry.Once you glue the halves together, you can paint the exterior of the shells with acrylic paint. Consider pouring the paint into a plastic bowl or cup, and mixing glitter into the paint. This will turn the dull peanut shell into a colorful, sparkly glitter bomb.
 Give the peanut to a friend. Tell them to hold each end and quickly crack the shell. Watch as glitter is released from the center.

 You should always vacuum carpet frequently, even if it's not new. However, vacuuming often when you first get your carpeting may reduce the smell. Try vacuuming every day or every other day and see if this does anything to eliminate the new carpet odor.You should always vacuum new carpet right after it is installed, as there may be debris and loose fuzz on the floor that needs to be vacuumed up.
 Baking soda is great at absorbing odors in the home. If the new carpet scent is bothering you, sprinkle a layer of baking soda or a carpet deodorizer (check your local hardware store) over the carpet.Allow the baking soda to sit for one to two days. Then, vacuum it up.
If you still notice a strong scent, you may need to apply baking soda a second time.
 If the smell does not seem to go away with other methods, you can try steam cleaning. You can try renting a steam cleaner and using it yourself. You can also pay for professional steam cleaning.Keep in mind, this should only be used as a last resort. Steam cleaning can be expensive and it does not really require steam cleaning for reasons beyond the smell.

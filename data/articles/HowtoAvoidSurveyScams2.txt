 The small but vibrant community of internet survey-takers should serve as your first line of defense against suspicious survey sites.If you suspect a survey you're about to take isn't on the up-and-up, then look around on some of the larger forums and blogs to see if any have been blacklisted by the survey community.The folks on https://forum.surveypolice.com are a great place to start.
 The Better Business Bureau (BBB) is an organization that collects complaints and reviews of all types of businesses in order to maintain consumer confidence. The BBB also rates member businesses according to their standards for best practices.


Search BBB reviews of the survey site in question at https://www.bbb.org/search/.
 In addition to the BBB, there are other sites, such as https://www.surveypolice.com, http://www.ripoffreport.com/ and http://www.scamdetector.info offer ratings and listings specifically for survey sites.


This is another area where you need to exercise caution. One scam detection site in particular, scamadviser.com, has a very poor reputation for flagging scams. Some commentators claim they fail to catch obvious scams, or allow companies to pay to have negative information removed.

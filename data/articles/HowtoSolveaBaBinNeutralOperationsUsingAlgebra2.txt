Enter into cell A2 ab/a = (a^b)/a
Enter into cell A3 b = a^(b-1)
Enter into cell A4 b^(1/(b-1)) = a; a has now been isolated and defined in terms of b and 1 but b may not = 1 lest division by 0 result in the denominator.
The simple algebra is complete.;
, Enter in cell C1 ="a=b^(1/(b-1))"
Enter into cell F1 the word "Var b" for variable b.
Enter into cell F2 the value 10.
Do MenuCommand Insert Name DefineName "Var" to cell F2.
Enter into cell C2 the formula, without quotes, "=Var^(1/(Var-1))"
Copy the value in cell C2 and do Edit Paste Special Value into cell C3.
The value you obtain should be 1.29154966501488

, that a*b = a^b:

Enter a*b into cell F3
Enter the formula, without quotes, "=C2*Var" into cell F4.
Enter a^b into cell F5
Enter the formula, without quotes, "=C2^Var" into cell F6.
Enter the formula, without quotes, "=F4-F6" into F7. The result should be 0. Done, because C2*Var = C2^Var, and the difference in F7 is 0!

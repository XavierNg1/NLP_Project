 From the outset select vegetables that can tolerate less water and more heat. Examples include potatoes, sweetcorn and New Zealand spinach.;
, Add a lot of compost from the start and keep the compost layer well maintained throughout the growing season. This will help retain the moisture in the soil and also acts as a barrier against too much heat affecting the vegetables.
 As well as compost, a layer of mulch will help improve moisture retention abilities of the soil. Make sure to choose organic mulch; use your own if possible.
 For example, a drip watering system (tape or pipe) provides a regular, steady feed of water without using a lot of water. It is more directed and concentrated, going to where the plant is rather than spraying all over the garden.
 The benefits of watering are best when done early in the morning. Deep watering is more effective than surface spraying.
 Sunshine from mornings and late afternoons is much kinder to the plants and during summer they will still get plenty of light.

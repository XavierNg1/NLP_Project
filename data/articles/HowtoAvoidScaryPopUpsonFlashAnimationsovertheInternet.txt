 If it's one that you've never seen before, don't take the risk.;
, If it looks like something boring or interesting, chances are it's a trick to scare you.(Note: some screamers have titles that say how to prevent screamers)

, It is usually a sign of a scary experience.
 If it does happen to be a "shock flash" animation, it will scream at you.
 Don't concentrate on it too much, it won't shock you this way.
 Also, look at the related videos. If it has a video of the car, any scary faces or pop-up video that you have seen, then it is a pop-up video.
 Some words just might give it away that it is a pop-up.
,, The more you anticipate it the more scared you will be., Make sure the song is loud and is not itself scary, or else it will backfire, and you will end up even more scared. Place some breathable, translucent material over your face, like a sheer scarf. The material should really be translucent; too clear, and you might see the video; too opaque, and you won't be able to see if, while the video is playing, someone walks up to you with the obvious intention of giving you a good scare.

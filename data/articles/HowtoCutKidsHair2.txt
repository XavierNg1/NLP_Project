 Make sure to have a conversation with your child before starting the haircut. You need to agree with them as to how short they’d like their hair. This is important to avoid grumpy children after the haircut. You can use Google to find images with the corresponding guard number (such as number 3) to show your child what to expect.


Remember that the smaller the number, the shorter the resulting haircut.
If the child’s hair is particularly long, you may want to start by trimming their hair with scissors before using a clipper.
 Make sure to keep your strokes slow and smooth. Work your way up towards the crown, and finish by cutting the sides.With this method, your child’s hair will be one uniform length. If you’d like their hair to be longer on top, you can give them a fade.
 A fade refers to a haircut where the hair is longer on top of the head than the sides and back. For instance, if you used a number 3 guard for the top of the head, you might use a number 2 guard for the sides. Start from the nape of the neck, bringing the clipper up towards the bottom of the crown. As you do, bring the clipper towards you in an arc to blend the different lengths together., Take the guard off the clipper, so it will cut hair to the skin. At the neckline, trim until the hair forms a straight line across the neck at your desired height. Then, turn the clippers over to clean up the fuzz below this line., Leave the guard off the clipper. Gently fold down your child’s ear, then cut the hair, following the ear with your clipper as if you were tracing an ear pattern in their hair.Don’t cut too high: you’re just cleaning up the hair around the ear.


For the sideburns, just place the clipper straight across the sideburn at the desired length and cut. Look at your child from the front to make sure the sideburns are even.

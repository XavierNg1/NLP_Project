 This includes school supplies, clothes, food, and bills. What's important is that you don't pay the most expensive amount for them.
 If you have to buy lunch from school, most schools give out a lunch discount at the beginning of the year, which you can sign up for. It will help you get cheaper lunches. Some schools even offer free lunches if you qualify.
 Preparing a packed lunch for school can be less expensive. How? Well, a loaf of bread can cost anywhere from $2-$5. Same thing with a school lunch. Except, if you buy toppings for a sandwich, you will get multiple toppings per package, unlike school. You will spend more money on buying lunch then you will on packing it. But, you can also sign up for lunch discounts so you can buy lunch when your school is selling your favorite meal.
 Make sure to use less power until your parents are back on their steady feet again. Wake up earlier, so you have more natural lighting instead of using electrical lights. Take shorter showers as well. While showering, switch between colder and warmer water while showering instead of just having an all hot bath. This will also be better for your hair. Do laundry once a week only, unless you have no clean clothes.

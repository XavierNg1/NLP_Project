 Experts in velvet cleaning suggest hiring professionals if the velvet is made of silk, acetate, or rayon. These materials are delicate and could be damaged with home cleaning.Cotton velvet fabric can kink during cleaning, so some experts also suggest professional cleaning for it. However, you may be able to clean cotton velvet fabric at home.
Check the velvet’s code. If your velvet’s tag has an “S” on it, you should treat it with dry cleaning solvents, not water, or get it professionally cleaned. It’s recommended that you get your velvet professionally cleaned every six to eight months.;
, Take the vacuum’s brush attachment, and clean the velvet along the nap. The nap refers to the fuzzy surface of the velvet.


You should vacuum your velvet this way once a week to keep your velvet looking good. You should also vacuum the velvet before trying to get a stain off of it.
Vacuuming the velvet should remove any loose deposits or materials that will worsen the stain or look of the velvet. Do this very gently so you don't damage the fabric.
 You want to clean the velvet as soon as you can, if possible, if you've spilled something on it. Take a soft cloth or a paper towel.


Gently wipe off as much of the spill as you can. In the case of velvet clothing, you could also shake it to release any excess materials.
It’s important not to let the stain set into the material, if possible, as that will make it harder to get off.

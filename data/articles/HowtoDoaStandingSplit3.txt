 A good variation of the Standing Splits involves resting your raised leg against a wall, or top on something such as a chair, table or a ballet barre. To perform this variation you can just move from a Standing Forward Fold into Standing Split a suitable distance in front of the object you will rest you raised foot on.Alternatively, you could start from a King Arthur Pose. This involves kneeling with your back to the wall and placing the shin of your left leg behind you and against the wall. Your toes should be touching the wall, and your knee a few inches in front of it.
Your right leg should be bent in a kneeling position with your knee in a line above your heel.
Bring your hands down to the ground in front of you, and place them shoulder-width apart.
Now slowly lift your left knee off the ground, and walk your left foot up the wall behind you.This variation allows you to support your elevated leg against a solid object, which is particularly helpful if you are still building up strength and flexibility.It's a good idea to practice the pose against a wall before you try it without any support.
 Bending and then straightening your standing leg when you are in a Standing Split is a minor but powerful variation that really deepens and the stretch and works the muscles.


Once you are in a Standing Split, carefully bend the knee of your standing leg and sink a little into the stretch.
Then straighten the knee and bring your raised leg up even higher., A final variation, that will deepen the stretch, just involves you reaching around and grabbing he ankle of your standing leg with the opposite hand when you are in a Standing Split. This variation requires a lot of balance and composure, so be sure you are breathing with a nice, steady rhythm and completely in control before you attempt it.

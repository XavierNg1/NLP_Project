 Decide the kind of look you hope to achieve with your artificial nails. Bold hues and designs draw attention to nails, while neutral tones soften and downplay the look of your nails. A French manicure most closely resembles what your nails naturally look like unpolished.
 Nail polish that is too thick builds up on your nail and makes it look more artificial. Start each coat of nail polish using thin, even brush strokes. It is easier to apply more color afterward than to remove color.
 Shorter nails look more realistic, as natural nails are difficult to maintain at longer lengths. Cut your artificial nails to a length that conforms with your natural nails. Notice if the tips of your nails are naturally rounded or square. File your artificial nails to maintain that same shape.

 Khaki can be worn in both the warmer and cooler months. When selecting a khaki dress to wear, keep the weather in mind. Pick a dress that won't be too warm or too cold for the occasion.For cooler months, try a knit khaki dress. The knit fabric will keep you warm while you enjoy wearing your khaki.
For warmer months, go for a shorter khaki dress. Khaki dresses come in short, sheer fabrics that will keep you cooler as temperatures rise.;
, If you're going for a night out, go for a more fitted khaki dress. A tighter look that clings slightly to your body can accentuate your figure. This can be great for a date night or going out to somewhere like a bar or club.Keep in mind that fitted dresses can be read as somewhat formal. You may want to opt for a different look for a more casual night out.
 If you want something more casual, look for an off-the-shoulder khaki dress. A dress that falls off one or both shoulders will have a more casual, laid back feel. You will still be able to feel slightly dressy without feeling too formal or fancy.An off-the-shoulder dress would work great for a casual get-together with friends or something like casual Friday at work.
 Khaki dresses can actually be quite formal. If you want to wear khaki for a more formal occasion, opt for a button down khaki dress. This can work great for the office, especially when paired with something like tights or panty hose.

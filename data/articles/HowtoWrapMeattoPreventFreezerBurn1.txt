 Freshness of meat will affect the way it freezes. When meat is frozen at peak quality, it will taste better when thawed and cooked.
 It is safe to freeze meat in its original packaging, however most commercial packaging is permeable to air, which may cause freezer burn if left only in its original package. Take the meat out of the plastic or paper you brought it home in. Discard the tray as well.
 Cut excess fat off meat before freezing with a sharp knife, and remove bones or bony pieces that might pierce the freezer wrap. If you want to keep the bone in, pad the sharp parts with newspaper or butcher paper before wrapping.
 Make sure you use a sheet large enough to let the joined edges on each side to fold down at least 3 times over the meat to be frozen.
 This is optional but will provide ease of separation without thawing the entire package.

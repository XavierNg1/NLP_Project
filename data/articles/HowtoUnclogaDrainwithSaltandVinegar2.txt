 Use a narrow cup or glass for mixing. Pour in a 1/2 cup of baking soda. Add a 1/4 cup of salt. Stir until they are evenly mixed. Remove the stopper from the drain if there is one. Then pour the contents down the drain., Heat 1 cup of vinegar in the microwave or on the stovetop. Once it reaches simmering, pour it directly down the drain. Cover the drain immediately with a stopper, plug, or even the bottom of the cup or glass you used for mixing, because the baking soda will cause the vinegar to froth and bubble. Contain the reaction within the drain as much as possible for best results., Wait 15 minutes so the clog can absorb the mixture as much as possible. For tougher clogs, wait 30 minutes. In the meantime, boil 2 cups of water. Once the clog has had time to soak, remove the drain cover and pour the boiling water down the drain to rinse, followed by hot tap water.

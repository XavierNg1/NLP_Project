 Wash and peel apples first. After that, you can core them with an apple corer, and then cut them into quarters. If you don't have an apple corer, cut them into quarters first, then slice the cores away with a knife.
 Stir the sugars, spices, vanilla extract, and salt together until everything is evenly blended and no lumps or clumps remain. This will ensure that the apples get coated with an even amount of everything.


For a milder flavor, use just 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon and ¼ teaspoon of ground cloves. Omit the vanilla.For a more flavorful apple butter, try: 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon, ½ teaspoon of ground nutmeg, ¼ teaspoon of ground cloves, and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract.For a sweeter apple butter, use 1 cup (225 grams) of white sugar and 1 cup (200 grams) of light brown sugar., Use a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula to stir everything together. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the crock-pot so that the apples at the bottom get coated with the sugar mixture too.
 Don't worry if your apples haven't turned to "butter" by the time the hour is up.
 Once the initial hour is up, open up the crock-pot and give the apple mixture a stir. Then, cover the crock-pot again, reduce the heat to "low," and cook for another 9 to 11 hours. From time-to-time, open up the lid, and give the apples a stir., This will help any excess liquid evaporate, and give you a nice, thick apple butter. If you'd like, you can stir the apple butter with a whisk to make it smoother., If the apple butter is still not smooth enough for you, take it out of the crock-pot and let it cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Pour it into a blender or food processor, and pulse it until it is smooth., Leave ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) of space in each jar. Wipe the mouth with a clean towel, then screw the lid on tightly. Store the apple butter in the fridge.

 While it may be tempting to purchase used furniture to save money or antique furniture for its character, many older pieces of baby furniture don’t meet current safety standards. This is important, as old furniture may put your baby at risk of injury or even death.Slats on cribs shouldn’t be spaced more than 2 and 3/8 inches (60 mm) apart.
Use a changing table that has cabinets or drawers -- so potentially hazardous products will be out of reach of your baby.
Focus on furniture with round edges or purchase caps that cover sharp edges., While you may be tempted to pile pillows a variety of items in the crib to make it more comfortable, do not. To meet current safety standards, your crib should have nothing in it but a mattress and a tight sheet.

Don't use crib bumpers. The American Academy of Pediatrics warns that crib bumpers may cause sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
Do not allow your baby to sleep with a blanket or a pillow.
Avoid leaving toys in a baby's crib while they sleep., Although you may be handy around the house or like hand-made baby furniture, you need to make sure that all the furniture you purchase is specially designed for a nursery. This is important, as sharp edges and other features on furniture could pose safety hazards to your child.

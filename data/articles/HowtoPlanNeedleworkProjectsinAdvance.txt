 The best thing you can do to make the most of your time, is to plan ahead. Start in January thinking ahead to the projects you would like to create in the coming year. You can organize these ideas into a notebook divided with monthly tabs. Simply write down the project plans in each month. You may even want to include necessary materials and how long you think it will complete.;
, Be careful not to plan too many projects within a given time. It's best to choose only as many needlework projects as you can take on, without creating undue stress on yourself. Try to remember that many needlework projects require quite a bit of time to complete. Make the most of your time by choosing projects that aren't trendy, and will be timeless for years.
 When working on a deadline, such as a holiday, one of the best tips is to set a daily, or weekly time to work on your projects. You may also consider packing a smaller project in a tote bag. (one of the best times to work on smaller needlepoint projects is when you're waiting on an appointment.) Around the holidays, it might be fun to set this work time apart to spend with friends.
 Though there is a time and a place for more complicated, multi-colored patterns and projects, during the holiday rush may not be the best. You might be surprised by how much time can be saved just by choosing patterns and projects that don't require a lot of color changes.
 Perhaps one of the best time saving craft project tips is to make multiples of holiday gifts you will be giving. If you are making one Christmas ornament, could you go ahead and make several for others on your holiday list? Over the course of working the projects, you will find just the familiarity of the pattern and the process will save you time and frustration.

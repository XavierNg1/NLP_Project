, Some old P.A. heads may need to be wired through a quarter inch plug so depending on your head unit you may need to do a little extra work creating your own cables to hook everything up (make sure to insulate the wires properly so you do not get a short.)

, If there is a switch on the inverter you will also make sure it is in the on position. If the head unit powers up with out the inverter reading battery overload then you are fine to continue.
 If it is a 30A then the fuse box in your car also needs to have a fuse that is marked 30A (you can pick up fuses at Walmart for under five dollars).
, Once you have taken the time to wire everything up so that the head unit turns on and the fuse to the cigarette lighter hasn't blown then you can move on with out worry.
 Once you have done this you may want to run a line from the outputs to the head unit. Depending on your stereo you may want to hook it to the sub line if you have a dedicated sub line. If you do not have a dedicated sub line then you may want to check for RCA outputs. These usually only carry a small signal so that they can be plugged into some for of amplification. If you only have these then you will want to run the line from your rear RCA outputs to your head unit.
 If it is three prong than it has a ground. You will want to find a way to take the ground and run a small line no longer than two feet in length to a metal spot on the car (with no paint either). If you do not have this there is a chance that you may get a lot of fuzz.
 Enjoy your new sound.

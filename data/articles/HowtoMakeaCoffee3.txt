 Lift the lid on the top of the coffee maker. In the back section, there should be a reservoir for the water. Measure out cold water and pour it into the reservoir.


Coffeemakers, like the pour over method, work through a process called percolation. In a coffee maker, the water is boiled in the reservoir, it then flows up to where the coffee grounds are, and then it drips through the grounds to make coffee., Fit the filter basket with a disposable or reusable filter that’s designed to fit that machine. Measure out the coffee grounds and place them into the filter. Use a medium grind for drip coffee.Some coffeemakers have a filter basket that swings out from its position above the dripper. If that’s the case with your coffeemaker, replace the filter basket to its proper position inside the coffeemaker.
Once you’ve added the water, filter, and coffee grounds, close the lid on the coffeemaker.
 After the water boils and drips down through the coffee grounds, the coffee will drain into the pot below the filter. Position the coffee pot onto the warming plate of the coffeemaker, below where the filter and grounds are sitting.


The warming plate heats up when the coffeemaker is turned on, and this will keep the coffee warm long after the water has boiled in the reservoir.
 Once you turn on the coffeemaker, you may have to press a Start button to activate the process. Other coffeemakers are simpler, and will begin to brew as soon as you turn it on.


The coffeemaker will take about five to eight minutes to brew a pot of coffee.
 The coffeemaker is finished when the coffee stops dripping into the pot. Transfer the coffee to a mug and enjoy it with milk, cream, sugar, syrup, or any other way you like it.


Keep the coffeemaker in the On position to keep any leftover coffee warm.
Remove the filter from the basket immediately, otherwise excess water could drip into the coffee pot and make the leftover coffee bitter.

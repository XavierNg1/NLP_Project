 Cut and roll in sections manageable for carrying out to the trash. Once all carpeting has been removed, move on to the real work.;
, Nails may have been added to the flooring to cut down on squeaking or to secure a loose baseboard. Either way, nails that are sticking up above the wood floor present both a danger and a nuisance. Most of the time, hammering the nails down deeper into the flooring is a better and easier solution than taking the nails out.


Hammer the nails down about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) into the floor. Use a nail set so you don't leave hammer marks(dents)in the wood. Work with their direction, not against it. Once the nails are 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) deep, they're ready to be concealed with a little bit of filler that you'll make after sanding down the rest of the flooring. More on that later.
 If old carpet backing is stuck to your wood floor, you will need to scrape it off with a putty knife. This can be a rather tedious job, and can take a great deal of time, but it's worth it.


Go over the floor with a vacuum and mop if necessary. Years of dust and grit can create a lot of debris. You want this debris cleared away before you attack the old wood finish.
 If tack stripping was present along with your carpet, remove it before you start sanding so that you can hit those areas with your finish.

 Determine if dating at this time in your life is worth it. This is always a good idea, even if you aren’t dating out of your age group. Make sure that you are going into a relationship with the idea that you may stay in this relationship for a long time, even forever. It will take time, money, and other resources to make your relationship work.;
, It makes sense to get to know them. With an age difference, you are more likely to enjoy different things and think different ways. Get to know the person and find out all of their likes and dislikes; what makes them tick.
 This seems a little strange, but it’s helpful to clear the air. If one or both of you has a problem with the age difference, but you still want to try the relationship out, go ahead. Often times, you will forget about the age difference and enjoy each other’s company.
 In social settings, mean-spirited people will often call the older person a “cradle robber” or some other such thing. More often than not, they are jealous of the fun and happiness the two of you share.


At first, you will try to ignore people like this. When that gets tiresome or impossible, don’t try to reason with them or explain why you are in the relationship. You don’t owe anyone an explanation. Simply say something like, “You’re right, we are a few years apart, but I don’t think I’ve ever been happier.” You’ll be surprised how quickly that quiets busy-bodies.
 The first stages of dating involve learning how to be the best of friends. Do that! Beyond getting to know each other (step 2), learn about each other and how to know what the other is feeling. Learn body language, changes in voice, etc.

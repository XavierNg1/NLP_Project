 "Is" tends to be associated with the partial amount, while "of" is paired with the entire amount. The word "what" indicates the unknown.

Example: A question says, "what is 10% of 16?" The phrase "what is" indicates that the partial amount is unknown. The phrase "of 16" indicates that 16 is the whole amount. This is an "unknown partial amount" problem.






Example: A question says, "15 is 25% of what number?" The phrase "of what" means that the entire amount is unknown, but the phrase "15 is" shows that 15 is the partial amount. This would be an "unknown entire amount" problem.
 First of all, change the percent into a decimal --- 0.25 instead of 25%, 1.38 instead of 138%, 0.07 instead of 7%, etc.
,

Example: "15 is 25% of what number?". Grab your calculator, enter 15, hit the divide key, enter 0.25, hit equals. The answer is 60. You're done. (Notice, it's just 60. Not 60%.)






Example: "32% of what number is 16?". Enter 16, hit divide, enter 0.32, hit equals; the answer is 50.






Example: "125% of what number is 80?". Enter 80, hit divide, enter 1.25, hit equals; the answer is 64.






Example: "6 is 7.5% of what number?". Enter 6, hit divide, enter .075, hit equals; the answer is 80.

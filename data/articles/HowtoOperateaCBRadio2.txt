 Tune into a popular channel, like 19. Other channels are seldom monitored, and 6 is often hogged by illegally over-powered stations who transmit for long periods of time. There are 40 stations for CB radio and you’re sure to find someone talking on one of these stations. Listen out for some common CB codes:


10-1 means the reception is poor.
10-4 means messaged received.
10-7 means out of service.
10-9 means repeat message
10-20 means what’s your location?, Listen to the channel for a few moments. If there are people talking, politely wait for a break. When you're sure it's clear, ask for a radio check. Wait for a response. If no one responds, re-issue a radio check, but wait patiently before doing so. When another operator responds, interpret their response.


Many operators are truck drivers who aren't looking for conversation. Others are enthusiasts that can not wait to chat. Follow the tone of the other person/people.
Be polite. Nobody wants to communicate with a rude operator. Also be sure not to take up too much air time while on a crowded station., Plan to use the CB radio with your friends by picking a station to use. Once you are apart, send out a radio check and wait for a response. Say something simple like, “This Wendy at the old lodge, over.” Wait a couple moments before sending out the signal again.


Once your contact responds, you can use the CB to chat. Do not use a crowded station for small talk.
 Channel 9 is immediately reported to highway patrol, police, and rescue services in the area. Use this station to relay any distress message such as suspicious activity or vehicle failure.


This station is also used by authorities to issue out important messages like an amber alert.Never plan to use this station for small talk.

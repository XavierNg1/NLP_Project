 The most flavorful and nutritious purees are made with the freshest vegetables that are at the peak of ripeness. Choose vegetables with firm flesh and bright color. Avoid vegetables with bruising or soft spots.


While frozen or canned vegetables can be used to create purees, they won't have the same nutritional value and flavor as purees made with fresh vegetables.
Any type of vegetable can be pureed (though it's harder to get a smooth puree with stringy greens). Try carrots, sweet potatoes, white potatoes, green beans, broccoli squash, and any other vegetable with flesh that becomes soft when cooked.;
, Make sure to rinse away all traces of dirt by running the vegetables under a stream of cold water. You may want to use a vegetable cleanser if you're pureeing vegetables that were treated with pesticides.
 Cut both the top and bottom ends off of your vegetables with a knife, and remove any places with bruising. Use a paring knife or a vegetable peeler to remove tough peels from sweet potatoes, white potatoes, carrots, squash, and other vegetables with peels., Cutting the vegetables into slices instead of chunks will mean less cooking time, and your puree will come out smoother.

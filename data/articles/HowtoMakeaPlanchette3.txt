 No one can ever agree on which Ouija superstitions to believe in. You can take these superstitions as dire warnings or funny stories, as you like.
 Many people believe that a planchette that moves off the board or table has become possessed by an evil spirit.Of course, you can't just pick up your hand when this starts happening... a planchette left on the board might be dangerous too!, Other supposed signs of an evil spirit include a planchette that moves to all four corners of the board, a planchette that moves in a figure eight, or a planchette that counts down through all the numbers or letters of the alphabet., Makeshift planchettes, especially drinking glasses, have a whole lot of extra superstitions. Some people never drink from a glass that's been used as planchette, while others only ban certain drinks, such as alcohol., Hold the drinking glass over a burning candle before using it as a planchette. Cleanse any planchette with your favorite ritual, whether that involves bible verses, pagan invocations, or herbal preparations at the right phase of the moon.Keep it clean in the mundane world too, with a little dusting now and then.

 Zesting can get a little messy if you’re not careful. A cutting board or similar surface will help stabilize the microplane while also collecting the loose zest. Make sure you keep the microplane centered over the surface as you work.A shallow bowl will also work, especially if you’re using a small handheld microplane.
If you don’t have another suitable surface on hand, lay down a layer of folded paper towels.
 Hold the microplane at roughly a 45 degree angle while you grate, bracing one end against the cutting board. Use smooth, light strokes and turn the fruit after every few passes. The basic idea is to remove only the brightest colored part of the fruit’s exterior.If you’re using a box grater or microplane with multiple blades, use the smallest set of holes to ensure that the zest comes out with a fine texture.Applying too much pressure can cause you to cut down to the tough white pith beneath the peel. Pith has a bitter taste that can throw off the finished flavor of a recipe., Scrape the loose zest into a separate bowl, or transfer it to a plastic bag or airtight container and place it in the freezer for later. It will best when used right away while the oils are at their most potent.Use a sprinkle of finely-grated citrus zest to add tart, zippy notes to cake batter, cookie dough, sauces, or marinades.Store the leftover citrus in the refrigerator until you have use for the fruit or juice.

 Before you sew, lay out the beads/jewels on the shirt to make sure you like not only the pattern of beads/jewels but also the overall design you are trying to create with the beading.


Consider taping the beads into place while you work so you don't forget the pattern. Use a fabric tape that will allow you to adhere the beading/jewels without damaging the shirt.
 Add several stitches to each bead/jewel to ensure it is set in place.


Knot each bead/jewel thread on the backside of the shirt so that the knot is not visible.
Consider double sewing each bead/jewel for extra support.

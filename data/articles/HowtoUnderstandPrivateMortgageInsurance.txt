The home value is based on the appraised value at the time of purchase. In the unlikely event that the home is purchased for more than the appraised value, the lower purchase price is used as the home value.
If the amount you are putting down is less than 20 percent of the value of the home, you will be required to pay PMI. For example, if you are paying $10,000 up front on a home that appraised for $200,000, you will have to pay PMI.;
, For example, putting less down might allow you to buy a home sooner, buy a more expensive home and/or invest more money in improvements. You should know what the estimated PMI payment will be to help you make the best decision. It is typically $50 to $100 a month.
 PMI is not normally handled as a separate payment to your lender.
,
You have reached the midpoint of your amortization schedule. For example, on a 30-year loan, your PMI would be dropped after 180 of the 360 payments are made.

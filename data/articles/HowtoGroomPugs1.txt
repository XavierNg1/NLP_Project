 You want to keep the folds of skin on your Pug’s face clean of debris and dry to avoid the risk of infection and prevent smells. Inspect the folds each day to make sure there is no debris or irritation present. Use your fingers to gently separate each fold around your dog’s eyes, nose, and mouth, inspecting each one thoroughly., Clean each wrinkle as you go, even if there is no debris present. Use a canine face or eye wipe to gently wipe the skin in between each fold. Gently swipe the wipe along the fold in one motion. Continue this process until the wipe comes out clean with no dirt or debris on it.


Canine wipes are the best cleanser to use on your dog’s wrinkles, but you can also use a soft wash cloth, cotton balls, or q-tips to clean the folds. If you are using one of these options, moisten the object with a 50/50 mixture of high-quality canine shampoo and water first.
Clean your dog’s wrinkles at least once a day. Doing so several times a day—particularly after your dog eats—is even better for keeping the folds clean.
Keep an eye on any areas you notice are infected or have a strong odor. If these areas do not improve after a day or two, make an appointment with your vet., Once you are satisfied that you have gotten all of the dirt and debris out of your dog’s folds, it’s time to dry them. Leaving moisture in the folds can increase the risk of infection. Run a soft, clean, thin washcloth along the fold until you’ve removed all moisture from the area.

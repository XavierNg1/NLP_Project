 Wash 2 cups (340 g) of fresh strawberries and use a knife to carefully cut and discard the stems. Cut the strawberries into quarters and place them in a blender or food processor. Add 3 tablespoons of sugar and put the lid on the blender. Puree the strawberries until they're completely smooth.Blending the strawberries will also help the sugar dissolve.
 Get out a small bowl and measure 2 tablespoons of agar flakes into it. Carefully pour 1/8 cup (30 ml) of hot water over the flakes. Stir the mixture to dissolve the flakes and set the bowl aside, so the agar cools. Avoid letting the mixture turn solid.Agar flakes are a vegetable gelatin made from sea vegetables. This makes them a safe vegan choice for making mousse.
 Pour 1 1/4 cups (300 ml) of whipping cream into a large mixing bowl along with 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar. Add the cooled agar mixture to the bowl. Use a stand or hand mixer with whisk attachments to whisk the ingredients on high speed. Whisk the mixture for a few minutes, so the cream becomes stiff.If you can, chill the mixing bowl and whisk attachments for 5 to 15 minutes before you whisk the mixture. A cold bowl will help the cream whip up faster.
 Transfer the strawberry puree to a serving bowl or mixing bowl and add the whipped cream mixture. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the cream into the strawberry puree. You can chill the mousse or scoop it into individual serving dishes before you chill it. Refrigerate the mousse for 4 to 6 hours, so it sets up.Garnish the mousse with 2 to 3 fresh strawberries and fresh mint.

 Place a large pan on a stove burner and heat the pan under medium flame., Once the pan has had a couple of minutes to warm up, add the shredded, flaked, or powdered coconut to the pan. Toast about ½ a cup (a large handful) of coconut at a time.This will make the toasting process quicker and easier.
 Use a wooden spoon to stir the coconut for about 2-5 minutes. Continue stirring the coconut until it starts to turn a light golden brown.


Remember, if the coconut is sweetened, it will brown faster than unsweetened coconut., Once the coconut has reached a light golden brown and it’s toasted to your satisfaction, turn off the flame to the stove, and slide the coconut onto parchment paper or onto a plate to cool.Place the cooled coconut in airtight container for storage.

 During the installation process, you’ll be asked some basic questions that you need to answer in order to proceed. When asked “Where are you?” click on the drop-down list and select your current location.


Click on "Continue" afterward to proceed with the installation process.
 If you’re using a special kind of keyboard used on your specific language (such as Japanese and Chinese layout keyboards), select your keyboard layout from the list and practice on the “Type here to test your keyboard” text field to see if you’ve chosen the right layout.


If you don’t know which layout to choose, simply click on the Detect Keyboard Layout button.
Click on "Continue" afterward to proceed.
 Who are you? You’ll be asked personal information questions such as the following:


Your name
Name you want for your computer
Username you want to use
Password for your computer (if you want to use a password)
Whether to automatically log in once your computer starts, or require a password before you can log in
You can also choose if you want to encrypt your home folder (for added security)
Simply fill out these details.



Installation complete! A small window will appear notifying you that you’ve successfully installed Ubuntu.
 Click on "Restart Now" to reboot your computer and start using Ubuntu 13.10.

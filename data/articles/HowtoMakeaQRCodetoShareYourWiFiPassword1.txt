, QRStuff.com and the QR Code Generator from ZXing Project are two popular choices, but you can find others as well. Try a search for "QR code generator" or "QR code wifi password" if you want other options.


There are also some QR code apps (available on Android, iOS, and other platforms) that will allow you to make QR codes from your mobile device.

, Pick somewhere visible to trusted visitors but not to those you wouldn't want accessing your network.



Certain QR code apps make it easier than others: Barcode Scanner (Android) allows you to connect directly to the WiFi network after scanning, and QRReader (iOS) allows you to copy the password at the touch of a button so that you can paste it easily into your WiFi settings. But any QR code scanning app should give you the basic text of the password so that you can copy and paste it as desired, no typing required.

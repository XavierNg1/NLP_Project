 These may be your strongest arguments. Nobody knows you better than you.
 Subtly refer to the fertilized egg as a human being, not a thing.
 When does a fertilized become "human?" Is it not the moment it is conceived? Does the baby suddenly snap from a funny-looking-fetus-thing to a human being at the second trimester? Show them 4D ultrasounds of babies during the allowed abortion time. It looks like, what? A baby?

, If you are unable to convince the other person, the two of you may have to simply agree to disagree.
 Don't say things such as "I'm right and you're stupid." You'll look immature and give a bad image for your cause. Especially if you're talking to a woman who is in the process of deciding.
 Even if you believe that it isn't her choice to make, bashing her will only make her resent you and your beliefs. But if she asks you for reasons why she shouldn't abort:


Discuss the reasons listed above.
If it's that she can't afford to care for the baby (which is usually the case), encourage her to have the baby and either put him or her up for adoption or drop him or her at a safe haven.
If it's that the baby is ill and might not make it anyway, remind her that he/she might not live if he/she is born, and will not live if aborted.
If the issue is that if she carries through with the pregnancy she has a risk of dying in the process: this is a very touchy subject and it's not so much a pro-life or pro-choice argument.

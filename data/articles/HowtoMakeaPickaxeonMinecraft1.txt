 Left-click and hold on a tree to break it into wood. Repeat this for several tree trunks.;
, Press E to open your inventory. Look for a 2 x 2 crafting grid next to the image of your character. This grid has an arrow to its right leading to a results box.
 Drag at least three blocks of wood into a single slot of your 2 x 2 grid. Planks should appear in the results. Drag these planks to your inventory.
 Drag four planks into your crafting area, completely filling up the grid. Drag a crafting table to one of your quick slots at the bottom of the screen.
 Click the crafting table in your quick slot bar. Right-click anywhere on the ground to place it in the world.
 This will bring up another crafting interface, with a 3 x 3 grid.
 Place one plank directly above a second plank in the crafting area to turn them into sticks. You can do this in the crafting table area or your inventory.


A common beginner mistake is confusing wood and planks. This recipe will not work with wood logs.
 Now you're ready to craft a pickaxe. Right-click on your crafting table and fill it as follows:


Fill the top row completely with planks.
Place a stick in the center of the middle row.
Place another stick in the center of the bottom row.
 Drag the pickaxe to your quick slot and click it to equip it. Now you'll use the pickaxe whenever your right-click and hold to break an object. Try breaking down stone with the pickaxe. It's much faster than breaking it by hand, and you'll get cobblestone instead of just destroying the block.


You can mine coal with a wooden pickaxe (black-flecked stone). Trying to mine iron ore (beige-flecked stone) or more valuable ores with the wooden pickaxe will destroy the block without dropping items. See below for more advanced pickaxe recipes.

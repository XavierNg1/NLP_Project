 When you look for auto insurance, you should compare the rates and reliability of at least 5 different companies. If you don't compare, you could end up paying almost twice as much to insure your vehicle. Once you have determined the companies that seem most stable, get quotes from them all to see what you can best afford.
 Start by checking the basic car insurance price quoted by the company's website. This number can change dramatically as other costs are considered, so don't stop here.
 Check to see how much liability coverage each insurance company is offering in relation to the overall cost of insurance premiums per year. This amount can vary quite a lot between policies. Add this number to your basic rate.
 Paying the lowest deductible may be tempting, but it might land you with a lot of expenses if you get in an accident. If you get in an accident, you will have to pay the amount of the deductible before your company pays anything.
 If you are involved in an accident, some companies will raise your rates significantly. Call a representative and ask what effects an accident, or multiple accidents, would have on your insurance. Eliminate companies that raise rates unreasonable after an accident.

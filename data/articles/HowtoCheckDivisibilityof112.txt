 For example, let's check whether 17952 is divisible by 11.
 Draw a vertical line to separate the two rightmost digits from the rest of the number. Move left two more spaces and draw another line. Repeat until the whole number is divided into pairs of digits. (The last digit on the left might be alone.)


For 17952, start at the right (the ones place) and count two digits to the left, then draw a line: 179 | 52.
Count left two more digits and draw another line: 1 | 79 | 52.
 Treat each separate section as its own number. Add them together:


1 + 79 + 52 = 132.
 If it is, then the original number is divisible by 11 as well. If your answer is not divisible by 11, your original number is not either. If you're not sure whether the answer is divisible by 11, repeat these same steps to test it:


Divide 132 into 1 | 32.
Add these together to get 1 + 32 = 33.
Since 33 is divisible by 11, then 132 is as well.
Since 132 is divisible by 11, your original number 17952 is also divisible by 11.

, Once you’re logged in, go to your inbox by clicking on it on the left menu panel of the window.


Web e-mail providers basically have a common layout, with the menu panel on the left pane.
 Once you’re inside the inbox, click on the message with the attachment you want to save.


Messages with attachments have the paper clip icon beside it.
 This is the part on top of the e-mail body where the e-mail details are displayed. In AOL, attachments are listed here instead of at the bottom of the body.
 Attachments in AOL appear as links instead of thumbnails. There is also no Download button to click. Just click on the attachment link, and it will automatically be downloaded to your computer.
 Wait for the download to finish and open your computer’s Download folder (located inside your My Documents folder) to view the saved attachment.

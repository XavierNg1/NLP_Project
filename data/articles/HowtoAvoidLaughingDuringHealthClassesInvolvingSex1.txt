 Things are always funniest when you hear or see them the first time. Prepare yourself for classes about sex or puberty by looking at the textbook and materials in advance. Get any information you can about what the class will be about. Talk to older students who have taken the class and find out what information will be presented.


Review as much information as you can ahead of time.
Ask the older students about the type of language the teacher will use. This way you’ll be ready to hear it.
Look up any words that are unfamiliar so you are prepared when ideas or vocabulary are presented.;
, Look at any books on reproduction or puberty that have pictures so you aren’t surprised or embarrassed if you see them in class. Do an internet search to learn how other teachers use visual aids in the classroom. Look at websites that are from teacher’s organizations, universities, your state department of education and other school districts in your state for this information.Consult with older students about the films and pictures you might see in class.
 Talk to your friends who take health class with you. Let them know you’re nervous about laughing. Agree not to look at each other in class or pass notes. Think about a plan to distract the teacher with a question in case one feels like laughing.


Plan a question that won’t embarrass you, like about any homework or what the next topic will be in class.

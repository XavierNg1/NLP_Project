 Rinse small bunches of fresh herbs under cool water or use a mixture of your favorite fresh herbs. Put half of the herbs into an 8-cup (1.81 kg) mason jar. If you don't have that, you can use a large bowl that's at least three inches (7.5 cm) deep. You'll need:1 small bunch fresh rosemary
1 small bunch fresh thyme
1 small bunch fresh oregano
1 small bunch fresh basil
1 small bunch fresh dill
1 small bunch fresh mint sprigs;
, Get out one 11-ounce (308 g) package of goat cheese. Cut the goat cheese vertically, so you get about 12 thin rounds of cheese.Try to slice the cheese while it's cold. This will make it less crumbly when you cut it.
 Place the goat cheese rounds on top of the fresh herbs in your jar or bowl. Put the rest of the herbs over the cheese. Get out 2 1/2 to 3 cups (591 to 709 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil out and pour enough of the oil to cover the cheese and herbs.You may not need all 3 cups (709 ml) of the extra virgin olive oil.
 Put the lid on the mason jar or cover your bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the goat cheese for at least three days. You can marinate the goat cheese up to five days.The longer you marinate the goat cheese, the more flavorful it will become.
 When you're ready to serve the goat cheese, remove it from the fridge and gently scoop the cheese out of the jar. Place the cheese on a serving plate. Serve the cheese with crusty baguette or crackers.You can strain the herbed oil through a mesh strainer. Save the flavorful oil for other recipes or to dip flatbread in.

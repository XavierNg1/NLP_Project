 Have 1 crew member pick up the first fuel delivery canister. Have a second crew member pick up the second fuel delivery canister and the fuel overflow catch pan.
 As the race car comes to a stop in the pit, open the door on the refueling port. Insert the nozzle of the first fuel delivery canister into the fuel feed pipe and invert the fuel delivery canister to allow the fuel to flow out. Hold the fuel delivery canister at about a 60-degree angle.
 The crew member with the fuel overflow catch pan must set down the fuel delivery canister that was carried out, and place the fuel overflow catch pan to catch fuel overflows.
 When the first fuel delivery canister is empty, pull it out of the fuel feed pipe and set it down away from the race car. Pick up the second fuel delivery canister, insert the nozzle of the canister into the fuel feed pipe, and invert the canister to a 60-degree angle.
 Use the fuel overflow catch pan to catch fuel that overflows.
 When the second fuel delivery canister is empty, pull it out of the fuel feed pipe. Close the door on the refueling port.
 The 2 crew members wearing fire protective clothing must take the 2 empty fuel canisters and the fuel overflow catch pan back into the garage area.

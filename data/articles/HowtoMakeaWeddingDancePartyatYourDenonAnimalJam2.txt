 If you want to use a Castle Den, you have to have a membership.
 Go to the Den Shop in Coral Canyons to buy the den. It costs 6,000 gems, so make sure you have enough.
 You can put the rug in the middle of the floor instead of in a corner this time. Don't forget that the Castle Den is much bigger than the Small House Den, so you will need more items. If you don't or can't buy a castle den for the wedding, ask a friend if you can use their den.

 Tea tree oil has been found to have anti-microbial properties, so it can be used to prevent fungus from athletes foot or other bacterial infections.
 Use 2 oz. (30 ml) of grapeseed oil or lotion. Mix it with 20 drops of clove oil, 20 drops of eucalyptus oil and 10 drops of thyme essential oil.


Rub the mixture thoroughly into extremely sore muscles. This is a strong mixture so you may feel a warmness or tingling sensation. Ask someone else to massage the mixture into an area if you cannot reach it. Sports masseuses and trainers often use these mixtures or other essential oil mixtures on their clients.
 People under stress, such as athletes, often suffer from lower immune systems during these times, so relaxation-based aromatherapy is good to use. The most commonly used scents in this case are tea tree, eucalyptus, lavender and thyme.
 This oil is known to increase circulation and help healing. Dilute it with more oil each subsequent time you use it.

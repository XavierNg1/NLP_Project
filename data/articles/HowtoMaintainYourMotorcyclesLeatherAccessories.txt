Be sure to use the correct type of cleaner for your motorcycle accessories. Look for one that does not contain alkaline or any acid as these may cause your leather to dry. Do not use regular soap or detergents on your leather because they can dry the leather as well, and take off the natural oil that makes your leather shine.



Be sure to rinse thoroughly and to let the leather dry slowly at room temperature. Do not use a blow dryer or any other heated appliance to try to dry your leather quicker.



Using conditioner on wet or dirty leather will trap the dirt or water into the leather and cause it to degrade faster. Leather conditioner will help keep your bike's leather moisturized. It also helps to prevent pollutants in the environment from damaging the leather.
You can also choose a conditioner specifically for your needs. There are leather conditioners that have ingredients that are antimicrobial and help preserve your leather. There are also those that provide waterproofing.
Use a small amount of conditioner and a soft clean cloth to rub it into the motorcycle's leather. Once you have covered all the leather, let it sit for about 1/2 hour to let it absorb. You can choose to apply a second layer or just wipe off any extra with a clean cloth.



Many riding accessories are made of leather and you may want to maintain those as well. If your leather clothes start to look as though they are drying, wipe a very small amount of petroleum jelly all over the garment. Let it dry before applying another layer.

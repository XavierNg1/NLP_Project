 When using any classification, whether species, genus, or one further up the classification system, always put it in italics in you papers. For example, if you were referring to the species name of humans in your paper, you would write sapiens.


Do not capitalize the species name.






When you can't italicize, or when you choose not to italicize, you can underline the scientific name as well.





;
, As you work your way up the classification system, you will begin to classify these names. The only name that you do not classify is the species name. You would capitalize the genus name, or any classification name above species.


For example, if you were discussing the human race, you would capitalize the genus name, Homo but not the species name, sapiens.
 You should include a species name when you want to be very specific about what you’re naming. No two species have the same official classification name, though a common name may be shared among species.
 Therefore, it’s best to refer to species by their official classification when writing scientific papers and the like.

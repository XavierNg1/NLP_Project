, People there will tell you a good item to merchant. Usually the title itself of the clan will tell you what to merchant.
 This is called "buying out" an item. Everyone in the clan will be doing this. Therefore, the price will go up a lot. Maybe even 100% if your lucky.
 You should usually sell a little below the medium price on the grand exchange.

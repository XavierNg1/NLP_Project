 You can't just pick up any old cleaning product to use on a record. They are too delicate for that, especially older records.Try a commercial cleaning product without alcohol, or if you're really in a pinch, a bit of dishwashing soap.There's some debate about whether or not to use isopropyl alcohol on records. Some say it's safe, while others say it can damage the record, especially older records. It's probably best to avoid any cleaner with alcohol in it.
 If you're using a commercial product, you likely won't need to do anything to the solution but apply it. For dishwashing soap, heat up about a cup of distilled water until its warm. Add in a drop or two of dishwashing soap and stir. You won't need a whole lot.Dip a microfiber cloth into the solution. Wring it out very well. You only want it lightly damp., Rub the solution in, starting in the middle and working your way out. Make sure to follow the patterns of the grooves. Once you reach the outer edge, move back in towards the middle going the opposite way. Repeat if needed.Avoid getting the label wet.
 Once you've applied the soap, you need to take it off. Heat a small amount of distilled water until warm. With a clean microfiber cloth, dip the cloth in the water, and then wring it out thoroughly. Follow the same pattern on the record that you did before, moving outward and inward on both sides of the record. Once you're done, let it air dry.

 You need to get the cigarette taste out of your mouth. Brushing your teeth and tongue is the best thing to do. Use a mouthwash too.
 After you're done smoking, eat something that will cover up your cigarette breath. Doritos and mints work best. If possible, it is best to brush your teeth.
 A dry mouth tends to hold much more odor.
 Drinking a beer and coke also helps.
 Make sure to have good quality mints or gum to help mask the smell. If you have time, brush your teeth and tongue; the residual odor will be reduced.

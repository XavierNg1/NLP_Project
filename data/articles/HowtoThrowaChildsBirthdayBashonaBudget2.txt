 For example, a "Pink 'E' Party", basically the child's favorite color and their first initial. This can be adapted to boys or girls and any favorite color. 

, It can be indoor or out; outside parties are great, but inside can be fun too.


Ask guests to wear something that matches the color theme. This will make for fun comparisons and great photos.
 For the given example, you could have pink cupcakes with the letter on each one, pink/strawberry ice cream, pink candy, pink paper goods, cookies in the shape of  an E with pink icing. You get the picture.
  Let the children decorate and personalize their own folder. (They could personalize anything. A folder is just a very inexpensive idea.)

, Find games related to the color, if possible. If not, think of animals, plants and items that are often in that color, then match the game to those things and stick to the color as much as possible.

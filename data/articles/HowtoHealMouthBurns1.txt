 Minimize mouth burns by cooling your mouth down quickly. Swish, rinse, and gargle cold water in your mouth for 5 to 10 minutes after you burn yourself., Suck on ice cubes or ice chips if you have some available. This can cool your mouth down even better than cold water. Carry a cup of ice around with you and suck on fresh ice until the stinging in your mouth subsides.If you burn your cheek or the roof of your mouth, try holding ice chips against the burn with your tongue.
 If you have some available, eat a few spoonfuls – or a bowl! – of ice cream. The cold will soothe your burn. Kids may especially enjoy this option.Eating an ice pop or scoop of cold yogurt or drinking a glass of cold milk may also help improve the pain.
 Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm (not hot!) water. Rinse your mouth and gargle with the salt water once your mouth cools down.Do not swallow the salt water.
 Down a glass of cold milk if you burn the inside of your mouth. Milk will coat and protect the mucous membranes inside. The cold liquid will also soothe and cool your burning mouth.

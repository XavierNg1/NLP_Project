 That counts just as much as if everyone else likes it. Have fun choosing your name and love what you end up using.
 User names like WakaWaka or Playboy fall flat because everyone already knows them, and that takes all of the fun away. Even names like ILikePie (The most common male user name a couple years ago in my school) just causes them to lose all of their points due to lack of creativity. Also, they're not really fun. Your name should be comical, fun and very clever. That's what gives it intrigue.
 People don't like copies. Also don't add random letters or numbers to it, it makes it look uncreative and bad. If your name is taken, think of a new one.

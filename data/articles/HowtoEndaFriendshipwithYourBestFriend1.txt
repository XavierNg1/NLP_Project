 It's important to carefully examine the reasons why you want to stop being friends with someone who used to be close.


Are you a different person than you were before?
Is the friendship draining, difficult, or toxic?
Did a conflict or clear issue cause this? Is this something that can be overcome, or is it better to end the friendship?;
, If your friend is nice overall, but you had a fight or there are a few sore points, see if you can have an honest discussion with your friend first.


For example, if your friend teases you about your hair but is otherwise good, first tell them that you don't like to be teased. If the friend is unwittingly hurting your feelings, sometimes all you need to do is say so and they'll stop.
If your friend does not care about your feelings, then it is definitely time to end the friendship.
 Sometimes, you become annoyed with a friend because you're spending too much time together. Spend more time by yourself for a little while and see if that is better.


For example, if you hang out for 6 nights each week, try being busy a little more often (whether it's with other friends or with a movie and popcorn) so it's only 2 or 3 nights per week.

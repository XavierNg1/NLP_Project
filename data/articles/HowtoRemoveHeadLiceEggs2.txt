 If you want to remove lice eggs ("nits") through wet combing, you'll need to learn how to identify lice. Spend some time familiarizing yourself with what head lice and lice eggs look like before wet combing.


Adult or baby lice are between 1/10 and 1/8 inch long. They're usually gray or tan in color. They cannot fly or jump, but do crawl quickly.Lice eggs, or nits, are small and coffee-colored before hatching. They are about the size of a sesame seed. They can be difficult to remove as they're glued securely to the hair shaft.Empty eggs/nits are usually white or clear-colored.
Use a magnifying glass to help you find lice eggs., Before you wet comb your hair, you'll need to prepare your hair for the process. Brush it with a regular brush or comb to remove any tangles. Cover your hair with conditioner to keep your hair wet. , Use a fine-toothed comb specifically designed for removing lice for the process (sometimes called a "nit comb"). Separate masses of hair into sections the same width as the comb. This allows you to see and remove lice more easily.Comb the hair one section at a time. Take one section of hair in your hand and comb through it. Start at the scalp and pull the comb flat against the head. Go slowly, and watch for lice and nits as you comb.If you notice any lice and debris build up on the comb, dip it in a bowl of soapy water to remove., Once you're done, flush the water you used to clean the comb down the toilet. Soak the comb in ammonia water, which is made by mixing one teaspoon of ammonia into two cups of hot water. Check the hair once again for any stray lice or nits. If you see any hairs with lice or eggs, remove them individually using a pair of scissors.Continue to wet comb once a week for three weeks, checking for lice. Contact your doctor if you see live lice after three weeks.

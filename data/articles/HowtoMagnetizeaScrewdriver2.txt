 Cut off a piece of wire at least 3 ft. (0.9m) long, then strip about an inch (2.5 cm) of insulation off each end.


Thin wire can overheat, while thick wire will be less effective. Try 16–22 AWG (1.3–0.6mm diameter) wire.Thinner insulation enables stronger magnetization. Enamel-coated wire gives the best results.To strip the enamel off the ends, rub the wire with 220-grit sandpaper., Wrap the wire tight around the screwdriver shaft ten to twenty times. You can double back for a second layer if the screwdriver is too short, but don't reverse the direction of the loop. (For example, you can move left—right—left along the screwdriver, but make sure to wind every loop clockwise.) Tape the wire in place if necessary.
 Attach the wire ends to the terminals of a 6V or 9V battery. The current flowing through the coils will create a magnetic field, which in turn magnetizes the screwdriver.


Using higher voltage batteries is not recommended unless you have experience handling them safely. Anything more powerful than a 9 volt battery only needs to be connected for a split second to magnetize the screwdriver.Wear insulated gloves to protect from shocks and sparks.
 The screwdriver will always be magnetic while connected to the battery, but the wire and battery terminals will heat up quickly.Disconnect the battery after 30 to 60 seconds, then try to pick up a screw with the screwdriver. In most cases, it will still be magnetic.


If the screwdriver loses its magnetism after the battery is disconnected, wrap a few more loops of wire and try again.

 Your disc-shaped battery has a positive side and a negative side. The negative side has less surface area than the positive side. The positive side is larger and has a (+) symbol and includes the side of the battery.;
, It probably looks like a tiny plastic bullet with two legs or leads. One lead is longer and possibly darker, this is the anode and needs to touch the positive side of the battery only. The other lead is shorter and possibly lighter, this is the cathode lead and needs to touch the negative side of the battery only. If the cathode lead touches the positive side of the battery, you will probably cause a malfunction in the LED. You can find out what color of LED by correctly attaching it to your power source, the battery. An LED is a light emitting diode, not a light bulb. The color is not determined by the plastic bullet shape, but by the semiconductor material inside the LED.
 Cut a 1" x 7" piece of duct tape. Holding one wire from the LED to each side of the flat battery, wrap the tape around the outside of the wires and battery. Wrap it one time around, neat and tight. The LED should come on. If it flickers, you did it wrong. Do over. You should have a portion of the tape strap hanging off to one side.
 Place the magnet against the side of the wrapped battery and continue wrapping the tape around until it covers the magnet. From this point on, do not pick up the Throwie by the LED. Handle it always by the battery/magnet.
 Lightly toss the device onto the front of your metal refrigerator or other similar surface. The strong magnet will attach to the fridge and continue to burn for as long as the battery will last.

Add it to the champagne mixture and stir., Run a warm bath. Add the champagne mixture to the bath as the water is running to distribute it evenly. For added aroma, pour in a few drops of essential oil (e.g. lavender oil) or add rose petals to your bath., Climb into the warm champagne bath and relax for 15-30 minutes, as desired. If you're comfortable, you may soak for up to 45-60 minutes.

 A charged creeper is created when lightning strikes within three or four blocks of a normal creeper, and surrounds the creeper with blue light. Creepers naturally spawn in the Overworld on solid blocks that have a light level of seven or less, and become charged after being struck by lightning in the game.Wait for lightning to strike the creepers, or position the creepers at a high point near water to improve your odds of having them struck by lightning. Alternately, install a custom Minecraft mod that provides you with ready-made charged creepers., The force of the explosion will cause the mob to drop its own head.

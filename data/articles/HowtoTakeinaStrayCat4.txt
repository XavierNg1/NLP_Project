 It will be a while before the cat feels comfortable in your home. It will take even longer if you have other pets and/or loud, noisy householders. Patience is a virtue when it comes to reassuring a scaredy cat.
 This can build a touch and smell bond between both of you, plus it's a good reminder for the cat that you equal yummy food.
 Play in a respectful manner, noticing when the play is scaring or annoying the cat, and backing off. Follow the cat's cues, not what you wish the cat would do.
 This will build trust in your voice and helps the cat to listen for you if it gets into any bother, knowing that you're trustworthy.

 Whole wheat flour is denser and heavier than regular white flour, therefore in order to produce baked goods with the same texture as white flour you need to use less flour. A good rule of thumb is to substitute 3/4 of a cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup of white flour.Be careful when measuring out the flour too, simply scooping the flour out of the bag with a cup can cause the flour to become too compact and you will end up using more flour that you actually need. Instead, try using a spoon to add the flour to the measuring cup.;
, Whole wheat flour absorbs liquid more slowly than white flour. Therefore, you will need to add additional liquid to the mixture to prevent the finished product from being too dry.


A good rule of thumb is to add two additional tablespoons of liquid (water/milk/etc.) on top of what the recipe already calls for.
As whole wheat flour absorbs liquid more slowly, whole wheat doughs will be stickier than white flour doughs. This is normal.
 If you are new to using whole wheat flour, it's a good idea to start out by replacing just 1/3 or 1/4 cup of the white flour with whole wheat. This will give your taste buds time to adjust to the new flavor and texture.As you become accustomed to the whole wheat flavor, you can try substituting more and more of the white flour with the whole wheat, until eventually you have completely switched from white to whole wheat.
 Another way to make your baked goods less dense when using whole wheat flour is to reduce the butter or shortening content by approximately 20%.

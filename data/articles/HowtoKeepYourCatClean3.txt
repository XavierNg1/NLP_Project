 You might have noticed cats with white faces that have rust-colored streaks running from the inside corner of their eyes, down over their cheeks. This is rusty streak is caused by tear overflow, which is a common problem for cats with watery eyes or narrow tear ducts. The tear fluid contains pigments called porphyrins and when exposed to the air, these pigments oxidize and turn rusty brown (it is the same process by which an apple when cut in half turns brown).


To keep your cat's face clean and streak free, wipe any gloop that forms in the corner of her eyes as soon as you see it. If you wipe the gloop away before it oxidizes, there will be no problems with brown stains.
 The skin of the ear flap should not be sore and the entrance to the ear canal should be clean. Avoid putting fluid or drops into your cat’s ear canal itself unless instructed to do so by your vet. You should try to avoid this because some cats are sensitive to the effect of fluid on the eardrum.


Check to see that there is no dirt build up in your cat’s ears, or that the ears are discolored in anyway. Signs of ear infections are covered in the next step.
 If there is discharge at the entrance to the ear canal, give it a sniff. If the discharge smells offensive, especially if it is cream colored or green looking, your cat may have an ear infection.


If you see these signs, have your cat’s ears looked at by a veterinarian.
 If the discharge is brown and waxy, try wiping it away with a ball of cotton wool moistened with a few drops of olive oil. Work the cotton wool into the nooks and crannies of your cat’s ears to clean away as much of the muck as possible.


When you notice this waxy discharge, look to see if she shows any sign of irritation, like shaking her head or scratching at her ears. If you don’t see these signs, you cat may just produce a lot of earwax. However, if you do see these signs, bring your cat to the vet for a check-up.

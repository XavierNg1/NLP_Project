This means, at minimum, you should get at least seven to nine hours a night if you are an adult (eight to 10 a night for teens).

If this is the case, gargling with salt water will help. Fill up a small cup with warm water and put a teaspoon or two of salt into it. Stir it in to let it dissolve.

Once you've gargled for a little while, spit the water out and repeat with fresh water.
If your throat is still sore or if you are coughing too much, try cough drops or a throat spray to alleviate the symptoms.

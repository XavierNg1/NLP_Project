 This will be one of the most important thing you'll need in order to make strong equipment.;
, Crafting armor requires ingredients; the ingredients vary depending on what armor you’ll craft. Collect the ingredients needed for the particular armor you’ve chosen to make.
 You could do with just Smithing, but a higher level Enchantment can boost the quality of the items further.
 These are rings, gloves, body armor, and necklaces.
 Grand Soul gems are preferred, but you can get any other type of soul gems.
 You can usually find these in alchemist shops.
 Disenchant one of your items with Fortify Smithing, and equip the other one.


You'll need to disenchant an item in order to gain knowledge of that enchantment; this is why you need two of each.
 You can use an Enchanter's Elixir for this. With a level 100 enchanting, plus an Enchanter's Elixir, your Smithing Enchantment will reach 28%.
 Wear all of your newly enchanted armor, drink your Blacksmith's Elixir, and craft all your weapons and armor.


Blacksmith's Elixir only lasts 30 secs; the time runs even when you're crafting, so be mindful of the time limit.
 Go to the Grindstone and drink another Blacksmith's elixir, then upgrade your weapon until they are Legendary. This will boost your weapon's damage to around 50% or more.
 Use the Workbench if you think you've still got time before the Blacksmith Elixir expires. Immediately proceed to upgrading your armor to legendary, if not then take a Blacksmith's Elixir first.


Like the weapon, your armor's defense will increase dramatically once it turns legendary.
 You'll probably kill almost anything in 1 hit or so. Of course, that would make the game a tad bit boring, but it's always useful for those difficult missions. Have fun!

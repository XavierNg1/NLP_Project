 Participants must be at least 12 years of age. Children under 12 are allowed to join the Famine for only eight hours. Consider, too, any health conditions you have, such as blood-pressure issues, diabetes, or depression. If you intend to give up food, ask your doctor if that's a good idea in your case.


If you want to fast, don't do it if you're sick. If you suffer from a chronic illness or other disability, consult your doctor first.
Those going without food should be well-fed prior to the event and should not maintain a fast during extreme physical exertion ("fun runs," sports tournaments, gym classes, etc.);
,, The most common Famine challenges include:


Going without food
Giving up technology (TV, radio, computer or other IT device, MP3 player, even lights and electrical appliances)
Not using furniture (chairs, beds, etc.)
Giving up free time or play time by doing chores around the house without pay
Some participants have even gone without sleep for 40 hours, but this is not recommended.
This is just a list of suggestions. You can invent your own challenge. Just be smart about it. Don't do anything dangerous. The point is not to be daring; it's to raise money and awareness for the underprivileged.
If you are a minor and choose to go without food, make sure your parents are well aware of this fact and approve of your choice.
 The Famine permits you to eat these to maintain energy.
 Many participants do this over a weekend (Friday evening through Sunday morning).

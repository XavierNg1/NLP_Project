 It is a long procedure but very gratifying when the horse responds. In order to make this process work, you need to do the following at all times:


Continuously speak to the horse in a rather soft/monotone voice.
Avoid spooking the horse by doing everything in a calm and slow manner.
Whenever the horse misbehaves (tries to bite or kick) during training, start all over again.
 Make sure he is properly fed and watered and his area is cleaned, but other than that, he should be ignored.
 After a few days of that, the horse will probably approach the fence where you are sitting and try to get your attention. Allow this to occur a couple of days in a row before you respond.
 If the treat is taken without any aggressiveness, do this for another couple of days.
 Again, depending on his response, continue doing this for the rest of the week.
, If there is no trouble, start in with gentle grooming.

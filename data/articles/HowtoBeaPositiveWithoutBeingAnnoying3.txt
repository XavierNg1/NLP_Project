 Assertive communication is the best way to interact with others. However, some people who are positive can come off as aggressive because they can end up hogging the conversation or talking about themselves too much. Assertiveness, as opposed to aggressiveness, is about being clear and respectful about your needs and desires without being aggressive (speaking loudly, talking excessively, yelling, etc).


Show a genuine interest in others. Avoid talking too much about yourself. Instead, ask questions.
Use a calm and appropriate tone. Loudness can irritate people.Try not to interrupt others in conversation, or when they are doing something productive.Show affection properly. Sometimes touch can be annoying or unwelcome to others.
 Sometimes super positive people can try to jump too fast into saying something positive to another person when the individual is hurting emotionally.


For example, if your friend just had a fight with her boyfriend, telling her, “Don’t worry about it so much,” might be invalidating. However, saying something like, “I know you are sad right now and that makes sense.”
Don’t assume you know how someone else is feeling even if you have been in the same situation., If your friend is feeling sad, avoid smiling at her or trying to make her laugh (unless she wants you to). Instead, look concerned and interested. You don’t have to feel sad yourself, but mirroring her emotions can help her feel close to you and believe that you understand what she is going through.


Curb your enthusiasm around individuals who might be more quiet.
 The most important component of using humor in a positive way is to know your audience. In order words, telling a dirty joke to a 3 year old may be inappropriate.


Avoid racist or sexist jokes especially if you know others might be sensitive to these types of topics.
Avoid teasing others in an offensive way.Pay attention to reactions and act accordingly.

 Because spice rubs are common among many cultures, there is no universal spice rub recipe.;
, For best results, place it in the refrigerator 24 hours before you want to rub the chicken. This will allow it to defrost more evenly than placing it in the microwave.

Place 1 cup (201 g) of brown sugar, 3 tbsp. (21.7 g) of dry mustard, 2 tbsp. (14.5 g) of garlic powder, 2 tbsp.(14.5 g) of onion powder, 1 tsp. (5 g) of seasoning salt, 1/4 tsp. (0.5 g) of cayenne pepper, 1 1/2 tsp. (3.1 g) of smoky chipotle powder.

You can use many types of chicken for dry rubs, such as breasts, thighs, wings, drumsticks and any mixture of them. If you are using a whole chicken, it is a good idea to cut it apart before rubbing it, to ensure that you get the rub on as many surfaces as possible.

You can also place it in the refrigerator for an hour, if you do not have a night to let the chicken sit. The longer it is left to sit, the more it will take on the flavor of the rub.

Alternatively, you can saut√© the chicken in a pan covered in hot oil. You can also sear the edges of the chicken for 5 minutes on a grill or in a pan and then place it in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) for 20 to 40 minutes.

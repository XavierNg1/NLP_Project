 Just like an athlete needs to prepare their muscles, a singer needs to warm up their voice to prevent strain and injury. Don’t start with a song, or even vowels and consonants. Instead, run through some scales with simple sounds and breaths. Exercises for your warmup include:


Hum. Humming activates your breath without straining your vocal chords.Trill your lips and tongue to warm up your mouth and jaw (ie. roll your r’s)
Begin with a simple scale, going up and down slowly (doh – mi – sol – mi – doh).
Begin with the easiest songs you are going to practice, waiting 10-15 minutes to tackle the tougher parts.
 Vocal chords flap and vibrate to create sound, and they need to be properly lubricated to move freely. Drink 4-6 glasses of water a day and keep a full water bottle near you wen practicing. On the night of a concert, make sure that you drink water throughout the day and before performing.Make sure you start drinking at least 30 minutes before performing so that your body has time to absorb the water.
 You need to feel well rested to focus on your singing technique and prevent vocal fatigue or injury. Adults should get 6-8 hours of regular sleep each night in order to sing as beautifully as possible.
 Alcohol and caffeine dry out your throat, causing your to strain as you sing.Eating or drinking a lot of dairy products promotes the creation of mucous, which can inhibit proper breathing techniques., Yelling strains your voice by forcing air violently through your vocal chords. Speak softly whenever possible to protect your voice when you need it,

, Smoking damages the tissue in your lungs and should be avoided at all costs. There are fewer things that can do permanent damage to your beautiful singing voice then smoking.

 Coming up with questions stimulates the brain and makes the class more engaging. Many students dislike speaking in front of their classmates. It is understandable to feel uncomfortable or awkward, but at least give this strategy a shot. You might alleviate that boredom. During lecture, if the instructor speaks too quietly or too quickly, ask him or her to repeat the information.
If the instructor leaves something out or is unclear when giving directions, ask for clarity. For example, if he uses a word you don’t know, ask what it means. If she does not mention a due date, ask her when the assignment is due.
 If you have some knowledge or a personal experience that is relevant to the content, don’t withhold it! You are more likely to make friends if you speak up during group activities and get to know people. Someone that you thought was weird or dorky might become a confidante by the end of the course! , Instructors sometimes feel unappreciated. Even the grouchiest teacher might perk up, though, if you show some interest in him or her. Acknowledge an especially useful lesson, chat the instructor up about an interesting concept after class, ask for career advice, or take interest in his or her family life (ask how a child or even the dog is doing). If you get to know the instructor, you might be less irritated during class.

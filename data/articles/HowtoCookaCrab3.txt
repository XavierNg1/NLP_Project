 Select a large stock pot that has a lid and place your crabs into the pot to see if they all fit. There should still be 3 or 4 inches of space near the top of the pot once your crabs are in the bottom. Remember how far up the sides your crabs come.Remove the crabs and set them aside while you get the water ready.
 Fill the pot with water so the water is 2 or 3 inches over where the crabs were. Cover your pot and bring the water to a boil over high heat. You'll notice steam escaping from under the lid when the water begins to boil.For even more flavor, consider boiling the crabs in a vegetable stock. For a simpler flavor, you could just add a a sliced lemon to the water., Carefully lower the crabs into the pot of boiling water. Cover the lid with the pot and set a timer for 15 minutes (if you're cooking one or two 1/2 pound crabs) or 20 minutes (if you're cooking larger crabs). Once the water begins to boil again, lower the heat so the water is only simmering.You'll need to watch the pot of boiling crabs while they cook. Make sure that the water is always at a lively bubble. Avoid boiling the crabs for the entire cooking time since this can make the crab meat tough and rubbery.
 Use tongs to lift the crabs out of your pot. Place them in a colander so the hot water will drain out of the crabs and into the sink. If you'd like to dress your crabs quickly, run cold water over them while they're in the colander.


Use caution when handling boiling water and the cooked crabs. Use oven mitts to hold the tongs (especially if your tongs are metal) since the tongs may heat up as well.

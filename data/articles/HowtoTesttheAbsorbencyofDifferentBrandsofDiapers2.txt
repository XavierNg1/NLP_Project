 Choose pitchers that allow you to control pour easily. Mix a solution of nine grams of table salt per one liter of water to simulate urine. Fill each pitcher with the solution.Use identical pitchers and have one pitcher for each diaper you are testing.
 You want to be able to pour directly onto the center of the diaper. This will most effectively test how well the liquid is absorbed and dispersed throughout the absorbent core. This is a better simulation of urinating than uniformly soaking a diaper in liquid., Pour slowly. Allow all of the liquid to be absorbed. Any excess liquid that runs off of the diaper will cause results to be inaccurate. When the diaper stops absorbing, stop pouring. If, after a few seconds, the diaper absorbs the liquid, try pouring a little more until absorption stops.Put the diapers in a bowl or pan to catch any runoff liquid. Pour the excess liquid back into the pitcher to improve the accuracy of your measurements.
 In this step, no math is needed. Put the pitchers side by side. The pitcher with the least amount of saline corresponds to the diaper that absorbed the most saline. The pitcher with the most saline corresponds to the diaper that absorbed the least saline.Use a chart or table to keep track of your data. Have one column for the brand or type of diaper and one for the amount of liquid left in the pitcher. The more liquid left in the pitcher, the worse the diaper performed.

 Your dog may be resisting going for walks, but it might not be because they’re stubborn, but because they are in pain. If your dog has gradually or even suddenly decided it is no longer interested in walks, this change in behavior could be a good indicator that they’re hurting. Get your dog to the veterinarian for an examination.


Your dog could have arthritis, which is a painful condition involving the joints.
Your dog may have sustained an injury, such as to the pad of their foot or to a muscle or tendon.
 Dogs, like people, can develop diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and dementia, that impact how they sense the world around them. If your dog becomes fearful of going for walks or their behavior changes, take your dog to a veterinarian for evaluation.These are progressive diseases, and your vet will discuss any and all viable treatment options.
Even if you are only able to tell your vet that your dog seems “off” or “different”, with a few examples, may be enough to help them determine if your dog likely has dementia or not.
 Some dogs have anxiety, and if your dog is one that does, your dog may appear stubborn when you try to take it for a walk. Because dogs can’t articulate themselves verbally, it might be difficult to distinguish between anxiety and stubborn behavior. Take your dog to the vet and explain the behavior changes. Your vet may prescribe anti-anxiety medications that should help your dog be more comfortable going for walks.Some signs of anxiety in dogs include panting, curling their tail between their legs, drooling, crouching low to the ground, and hiding.

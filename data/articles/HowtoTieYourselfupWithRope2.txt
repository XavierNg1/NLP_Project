 Make sure that it's just a little looseâ€”the rope shouldn't hurt you, but it should be tight enough that it won't slip off. You must wrap the rope with both ends going around you instead of one. When you are holding less than a foot of loose rope in each hand, pull the rope tight. Hold it tight until you are able to tie it.
 Tie the ends of the rope together using a square knot, a double-tied bow, or any other simple, sturdy knot. Squeeze your free arm into the wrapped rope, as deep as it will go, until you appear stuck.


Try wrapping the rope around the area with one hand, then using the other to grab the rope and help out. Tie the ends of the rope with a tight double-knot bow.
Consider puffing your chest or stomach out as you pull the rope tight and tie it. This way, all you need to do to loosen the rope is empty your lungs of air and make your torso more compact. You can also flex your arm muscles to make the wrap slightly larger than your natural form.
To escape this trap, squeeze the arm that you used to tie the knot. This should loosen the rope so that you can slip out of the wrap.
 Use a separate rope for each knot. Try knotting your feet together (with a 2-3 feet of long rope) using the same technique that you'd use for your hands. Consider binding your legs together in the same way, but bear in mind that the rope is likely to slip down your legs. Finally, tie your wrists together, making sure to tie a knot or cinch between them so that the rope doesn't slip off.

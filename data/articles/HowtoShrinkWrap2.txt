 Just as with the impulse sealer method above, you still have to choose the shrink-wrap film best suited to the job at hand. For most items at home using scissors and a blowdryer, PVC film should work fine.
 Fold the item in the film as though you were going to gift wrap it, and cut a piece of film that size from the roll. The sheet you cut should be a single piece slightly larger than what you need.
 Trim off any excess strands of shrink wrap. The film should cling tightly to the item, eliminating any air pockets and uncovered spaces.
 If the way you wrapped the item has left a seam that needs to be sealed before you can continue, use the hairdryer to heat directly along the overlap of the seam to seal the film.
 Apply heat from the hairdryer evenly around the wrap until it shrinks. If you apply it unevenly, the wrap will not shrink proportionately.


A hairdryer will require more time than a heat gun to shrink the film properly. Heat as evenly as possible.
The finished product will serve its purpose, but this method requires lots of practice to create a finished product with a look similar to using actual shrink-wrapping equipment.

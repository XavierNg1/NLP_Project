 Choose colors that will work for the scene and ambiance you want to create with your holiday window paint.


Use color schemes already associated with the holidays. Certain holidays already have specific colors assigned to them through tradition. For instance, Christmas is associated with red and green.
Opt for white and blue to create generic winter scenes.
Use festive metallic hues like silver and gold to create a sense of festivity commonly associated with the holidays.;
, Tempera paint dries with a matte finish and the end result is usually translucent. Moreover, it is the easiest paint to remove.
 Acrylic craft paints are among the most commonly used paints for temporary window illustrations. They can be scraped off windows fairly easily but are a little more durable than tempera paints.
 This step is especially important if using acrylic paints, since dish soap reacts with the paint and makes it easier to wash off later. Add 1 teaspoon of dish soap to every 1/4 cup bowl of paint and mix thoroughly.
 Permanent paints specifically meant for windows will be nearly impossible to clean off once the holidays pass.

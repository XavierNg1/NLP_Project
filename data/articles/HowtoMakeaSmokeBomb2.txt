 Smoke bombs are composed of a simple concoction of potassium nitrate and sugar. By mixing these ingredients and melting them together, you create a flammable product that produces whirls of smoke when you light it on fire. Here's what you'll need:

Buy potassium nitrate, also called saltpeter, online. You can also find it at your local garden store, since it's used to treat soil.






Get some sugar. Dark brown sugar is said to make the smoke look thicker, but white will also do just fine.






Pick up some baking soda. Adding a tablespoon or so will make the smoke take a bit longer to burn.






Get a small length of fuse to insert in the smoke bomb.






Obtain a cast iron skillet.
Prepare a cardboard box lined with aluminum foil.
 Don some gloves, goggles, and a filter mask.
 Measure out three parts saltpeter to two parts sugar.
 Stir the mixture constantly until the mixture is completely melted. As the sugar caramelizes, it should take on a brown or black color.


Do not overcook the mixture. Take care not to let it start on fire. If it starts to smoke, turn off the heat immediately.
,,, It might take an hour or so to solidify.
 Take it to the desired location and light the fuse.

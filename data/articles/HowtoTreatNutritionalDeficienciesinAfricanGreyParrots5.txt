 Your bird still needs iron, so don't cut off their iron intake entirely. Reduce the amount of bananas, mangos, papayas, squash, and skinless potatoes you feed them. Substitute these foods with honeydew melons, peaches, plums, and peeled apples., Avoid beetroots, carrots, chili peppers, and spinach. Never give your bird baby food, juices, nectars, or commercial food formulated for humans or other animals. In addition to Vitamin C, they also contain too much iron for avian bodies., Give your bird iron-reducing supplements like tannins and fiber. Feed them whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Work with your vet to work out a schedule for regular blood tests, probably for the rest of your bird's life.

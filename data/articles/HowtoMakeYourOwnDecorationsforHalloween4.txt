 Just below the lid is what you don't want. Use a craft knife to make this easy -- scissors will be difficult to work with.


Make sure your milk jug is clean! If there's still a milky residue it may end up smelling.
 This will form the body of your spider. Go as tightly around the handle as you can; but don't worry -- if it's still discernible, that's fine.
 These will be the legs. Tape each one in the center along the handle of the jug.


Then, tape the tubes along the sides of the jug too, to make it look as if the legs are going along the body. The tubes will bend into place.
 If you cut a slit in the tube, it will bend at your cut. If you hold it in the bend, you can tape it to stay permanently bent. This will form the joints in your spiders legs.


A 1" (2.5 cm) triangle cut is good -- the tube won't unexpectedly break off. Just hold it at its bending point and wrap tape around the newly-formed joint.
 They'll bulge out and be adequately creepy -- especially if you cut a slit of black tape for pupils. If you don't have an egg lying around, puff balls (or anything circular, really) work as well. Just attach them to the jug with more tape or glue.

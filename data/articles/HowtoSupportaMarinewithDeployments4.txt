non-perishable foods (beef jerky, crackers, canned goods, candy)
baked goods like cookies (well wrapped and protected from crushing)
hygiene items (razor blades, a new washcloth, toothpaste, ear swabs, feminine hygiene products if applicable)
tobacco products, especially brands/sub-brands that aren't usually exported (even if your Marine doesn't use, he can trade with his buddies)
CDs and DVDs, as well as players for them (DVD players with small screens work well)
local newspapers, uncommon magazines that he might not be able to get from the PX (especially if he has a subscription).
computer accessories if he has one (thumb drives/USB flash drives are handy)
photos of family, friends, and home (don't send anything you wouldn't want him to share with his buddies)
paperback books of all kinds
extra uniform items like headgear and rank insignia
prepaid phone cards (use a company that gets a favorable usage rate)
fun stuff like toys or silly string (don't worry, your Marine will know how to use it effectively for combat)
canine handlers always appreciate dog food, treats, and toys for their working dogs
include notes/letters from any other friends and relatives that might not have mailed them out already to save postage

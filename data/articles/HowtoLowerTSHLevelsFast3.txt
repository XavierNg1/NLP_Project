 Thyroid surgery, called a thyroidectomy, is a good option if you cannot tolerate antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine therapy. Though done in rare cases, it can be a viable option for some with high TSH levels. During the thyroidectomy, the doctor will remove most of your thyroid gland.You will be under general anesthetic during the surgery. You will need to stay in the hospital for about two days to complete the surgery.
 Risks include damage to your vocal cords and to your parathyroid glands. These four small glands at the back of your thyroid gland help to control the amount of calcium in your blood.Your doctor should outline all the possible risks before you agree to the surgery.
 After the thyroid surgery, you will need to recover at home for several weeks. You will need to take thyroid hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life so you do not develop hypothyroidism.If your parathyroid glands were removed during the surgery, you will also need to take medication to maintain normal blood-calcium levels.

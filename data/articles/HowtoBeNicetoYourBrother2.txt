Instead of continuing to engage in a fighting mood, know which battles are worth pursuing and which ones are best left alone. Try to compromise or even see his side of things for a change when you do feel completely unhappy about what's happening between the two of you. You might just shock him into seeing your point of view as well!

, Go out of your way to do this even when it’s abnormal or unappreciated. At the very least it could help you two avoid potential argumentative or bossy situations.
 This could be a tough task, especially if he is a slob, but it’s something that could really make him happy. Try to put what he likes at the forefront, and what barely gets used into the recesses of the closet.


Organize his movies or music alphabetically. Make it so he knows exactly where his favorites are located.
Fold and organize his clothes. From time to time, clothes just get disorganized. Straighten up his closet and get all the similar items together.
Vacuum and dust. Actual cleaning may take a little elbow grease, but it's a good bet if your brother doesn't really like people messing with his stuff.
 Doing your brother’s chores will give him extra time to do what he likes. Being selfless helps you to really reflect on how much you appreciate and love your brother, and it’s surely something he would appreciate. There may even be the added benefit of your parents noticing and rewarding you.

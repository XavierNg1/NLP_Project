 If you are pitching properly, then you will not have control issues. Remember these steps:


Keep your head straight towards the catcher's mitt, do not pull it.
Aim with your glove hand. Point it directly at the catcher and tuck it while throwing.
Step straight. The ball goes where your foot goes.
Follow through. Make sure your arm touches the opposite knee to keep the ball low. Also try to carry enough momentum to make your throwing side foot come forward.
 Unless you are in the College World Series, the minors, or the MLB, baseball is just a relaxing sport with no consequences if you fail. If you cannot hit the strike zone, then take deep breaths and walk around the mound until you have regained your composure.
 If you can't field a ball coming at you, use your reflexes to try to get out of the way. If you keep calm and follow your mechanics, you will pitch fine, but tell your coach to take you out if your arm is hurting.

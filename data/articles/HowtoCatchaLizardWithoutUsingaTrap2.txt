 If you cannot find a stick with these dimensions, you could whittle a wider, longer one down to the appropriate size.
 Tie a slipknot with the dental floss.


To tie a slipknot, bring one end of the dental floss about two thirds of the way down towards the other end of the dental floss. The dental floss should resemble a “C.”
Holding the curved side of the loop in your left hand and the two ends of the “C” in your other, twist your left hand to form a loop. Pass your left hand through the loop and pull the bottom arm of it back through. Do not bring the entire arm of the floss through the loop. Leave the tip of the floss just outside it.
 The loop should hang about four to six inches down from the end of your stick. Approach the lizard you want to catch slowly and cautiously. Hang the loop slightly in front of it and either wait for it to enter the loop or gently ease the loop around the lizard’s neck. Either way, when its neck is within the loop, pull up gently to tighten the slipknot and catch the lizard.
 Place one hand over the lizard with your index finger resting gently on top of its head. Move your other hand slowly but cautiously toward the loop tied around its neck and pull the floss away from its body. This will loosen the slipknot and allow you to ease it off over the front of its head.


There is little chance of hurting or choking the lizard with the slipknot when it is only stuck within it for a short while. However, if you leave the lizard fighting the slipknot or struggling to break free, it might hurt itself. Remove the slipknot as soon as possible.

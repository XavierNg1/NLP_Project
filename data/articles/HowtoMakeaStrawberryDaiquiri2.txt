 stemmed glass and use a bar napkin to wipe the edge with Roses Lime Juice. Look at you, with your professional habits! The other option is to quarter a lime and run the wedge along the rim. Whichever is easier.
 Do this along the entire rim and try to get an even coating on all sides.
 Do this from 1/3 down from the stem to the tip and place on the rim of the glass. Part of the greatness of the strawberry daiquiri is the presentation. It's gotta be pretty!

, Fill that glass up to the brim. Don't be shy! A can of whipped cream will make for the best presentation unless you have a piping bag.
 Slice it in half the long way. Then make slits starting, again, from 1/3 of the way down from the stem. Once all your slits are made, press down gently with your hand to fan it out. Place it, in its fan shape, on top of the whipped cream.
 If you have a drink umbrella, add that too!

Enjoy safely. Even though it's beautiful and tasty, there is alcohol in it. At the end of the day, getting pulled over for slamming 6 fruity daiquiris is as bad as pounding the tequila.

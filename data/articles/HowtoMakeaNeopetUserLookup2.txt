 You'll need to know these codes to make a lookup yourself, and they are fairly easy to learn if you try. You could memorize the codes and tags, or create a list of them and what they do on a sheet of paper or on a document on your computer.
 The simpler the better. You'll use this document to enter and organize your coding. You'll later put it onto your user lookup on Neopets.
 It's best to use a very light or bright solid color if you're going to use a dark font, and a very dark color if you're going to use a light font. It's not a good idea to use pictures as backgrounds unless text can easily be seen in front of them. If you use a picture, you'll next to add scroll boxes for your text later.
 This is where CSS comes in handy, as you'll need to set default, link, and hover colors, sizes, and fonts for your text. Try not to make blinking text, as it's hard to see. But be creative; as long as the text is readable, it's okay.
 You could put them in a box together, or in different ones––whatever looks best.
 Provide links to the different Neopets pages. Nobody likes a user lookup with a header, and it will make your page look clean and simple if it's gone. Do an online search for: "remove Neopets header code" to get the code for this.
 Be sure to use center, right, and left tags to organize everything. You're done!

 Check to make sure you didn't leave any shell in the egg yolk and that the egg looks fresh and good.;
, To scramble an egg properly, whip it in the cup until you've thoroughly beaten the yolk into the white. An egg ready for scrambling shouldn't be quite frothy, but should still have some viscosity to it so it will make delicious scrambled curds.
 At this point, you can add salt, pepper, or any other seasonings you'd like in your scrambled egg.


You can add a few tablespoons of milk or water to the egg to make it more "fluffy," but it might taste more like an omelet. Experiment with additions and see what you like.
 Place a knob of butter in a saucepan and melt over a medium heat. When the butter gets slightly frothy, you're ready to add the egg.
 It's very important to steadily stir the egg in the pan, or else the egg will stick and cook unevenly.


Use a wooden spoon and continually work the egg in circles, drawing the curds inward and mixing the uncooked egg around to cook everything more evenly. It's very easy to over-cook scrambled egg, so be vigilant.
 The hot pan will continue cooking the eggs, so unless you like crunchy burned scrambled egg, remove the pan off the heat and let it finish cooking. After the egg looks fluffy and not runny, put the scrambled egg onto a plate and you've got a quick and easy breakfast you will love!

 If you don't, you may confuse the beat of the song (although this can sound extremely good if done well).
 This will give it a bit of variety and give some "flow" to your music. All being well, you will have a functional, if not a little bland, drum and bass tune.
 This will give you a varied tune that should sound a little bit more complete.
 You can do this in a number of ways, you can use vocals and add that over what you already have done; you can use some atmospheric pads to make it sound a little modern and trance like. You can add traffic noises or speaking to give different atmospheres, etc. Really the sky (meaning your imagination) is the limit here. DnB is crazy experimental, so anything goes with sounds. Think bold. Think of your song as a story. What are you trying to get across? The bustle of the city? Angry drivers? Birds migrating south for winter? Whatever, just try to visualise what you are trying to capture in your mind and then add some effects that you think would suit that. You may find that it keeps you more focused on a "theme" for your song and helps with keeping you on track.

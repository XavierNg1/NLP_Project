 Find the point you noted or marked where the picture will hang from, and make a small hole in it for the stud anchor. If you have a power drill, use a small drill bit and drill in until you feel or hear the bit hit the stud. Otherwise, use a finish nail and a hammer to make the hole.
 Again, this is easiest with a power drill and a screwdriver tip, but a manual screwdriver can also be used. Set the point of the anchor screw into the hole you made and screw it into the wall. It will thread into the stud, creating a strong hanger for your picture. Once the anchor is set, continue screwing it until it is an appropriate length from which to hang your picture.
 If it slips off easily, unscrew the anchor a bit and try again. If there is a gap between the top of the frame and the wall, screw the anchor in a little more and try again. Once the picture hangs securely and flatly against the wall, no further adjustments to the anchor are needed.
 Set a level on top of the frame and gently adjust the picture until the level reads flat and even. Step back and enjoy the way your new picture hangs on the wall. Be sure to clean up any tools and debris afterward.

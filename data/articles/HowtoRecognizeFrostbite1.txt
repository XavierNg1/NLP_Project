 The first signs of frostbite will be evident on your skin, likely in the form of an uncomfortable or painful redness.Watch out for signs of whitening or grayish-yellow skin, areas of skin that do not register your touch, or feel unusually firm or waxy.
In more severe cases, skin may become blue, mottled, or splotchy.;
, Accordingly, keep an eye on any of your own or others’ exposed skin when outdoors in cold weather.Many people will try to "tough out" frostbite symptoms as they initially do not seem serious.
Periodically check in with any companions every 10 to 20 minutes both visually and verbally.
 While these sensations may seem innocuous, they are actually a sign of oncoming frostbite.Be aware of any physical sensation out of the ordinary.


In particular, watch out for a gentle prickling that progresses into numbness as well. Again, this likely indicates oncoming frostbite.
A ‘flushing’ feeling and the rushing of blood into an extremity indicates that your body is trying to fight the cold, but is starting to fail to keep your extremities sufficiently warm.
 There are several signs that warn you of an oncoming case of frostbite before any serious repercussion has occurred. Superficial frostbite may lead to skin damage while severe frostbite can potentially permanently damage nerves and tissues beneath the skin.Recognizing frostbite as early as possible will help you prevent frostbite from reaching the point where it leaves a victim permanently injured.
In particular, watch for the development of redness on the skin, and skin that feels cold to the touch or is irritated.

Though not dangerous, frostnip does indicate that a person’s skin and tissues are starting to be affected by the weather, and that the person should return to a warmer environment soon.

 Bags or circles caused by aging won't respond to lifestyle changes, but getting a hyaluronic filler can improve the appearance of the under-eye area. The filler is injected under the eyes to make the contours of the eye socket appear more youthful.


This procedure can be dangerous if it's not done by a professional. Do research before committing to getting a filler.
Fillers usually cost several hundred dollars, and can lead to negative side effects like bruising and swelling.
 As people age, fat deposits move down from the eyeballs and accumulate in the under-eye area, leading to bags. Blepharoplasty is the process of removing or changing the position of the fat that has accumulated, followed by a laser treatment to tighten the skin in the area.Blepharoplasty procedures usually cost between $2,000 and $5,000 dollars.
The recovery period can last several weeks.

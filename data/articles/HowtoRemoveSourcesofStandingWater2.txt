 If you have a pond on your property, there are several things you can do to ensure it doesn’t turn into a giant deposit of murky standing water. Foremost, install an aerator or fountain in the pond to maintain a constant disruption to the water’s surface.Another option is removing trees and brush from the immediate vicinity of the pond. This will allow the wind to ripple the pond’s surface.
 This will reduce the amount of organic material available for mosquito larvae to feed on. If you do decide to go with soil, make the walls of the pond as steep as possible to prevent shallow areas., If you have a pool, it can quickly turn into an expensive reservoir of standing water if not cared for actively. Chlorine is the most common treatment, as it is a relatively simple and inexpensive process. Make sure your pool’s aerator is working as well, and cover the pool whenever it is not in use., To prevent bird baths from serving as mosquito breeding grounds, the water should be removed and changed weekly. Whenever you do so, wipe the bird feeder with a rag or spray it out with the hose.Do the same with small hanging birdfeeders.

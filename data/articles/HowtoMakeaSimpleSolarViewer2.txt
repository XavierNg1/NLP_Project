 To improve the quality of your image, you can project it on a white screen. The easiest way to do this is to take blank white paper and tape it up at the end of the viewer (furthest from the hole). One sheet of paper is sufficient., In order for your viewer to capture the an image of the sun, you have to aim it. Avoid looking at the sun to aim the viewer. Instead, point the viewer in the general direction of the sun and then move it around slowly until you see the sun on your screen., Once you have the sun on your screen, it is safe to look at. You do not need any safety glasses or other special equipment. The image is much less intense than actually looking at the sun.

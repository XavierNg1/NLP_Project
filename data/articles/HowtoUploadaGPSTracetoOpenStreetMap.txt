 Only GPS traces in the GPX file format can be uploaded to OpenStreetMap.;
, Note that you must have an account and be logged in to upload a GPS trace.
,, When uploading GPX files, tags provide a simple way to describe your GPS traces. They make your GPX file findable with a single word and allow you to group the trace alongside other similar traces. For example, all the traces tagged 'Melbourne' are listed at www.openstreetmap.org/traces/tag/Melbourne.


Tags are case-sensitive, so Melbourne and melbourne may supply different results.
Each file can have many tags, and you can enter as many as you like with commas (",") between them.
Usually the tags are the names of countries, cities and other places your trace concerns.
All the traces you upload will be accessible from your OpenStreetMap profile (unless you choose "trackable" or "private" visibility), so there's no need to use a tag to identify your traces from other people's.
 You can review a description of each visibility level here; generally in order of most public to least public, the options are identifiable, public, trackable, and private.
 The file will be uploaded to the OSM server, where it will join the queue of files waiting to be inserted into the database.

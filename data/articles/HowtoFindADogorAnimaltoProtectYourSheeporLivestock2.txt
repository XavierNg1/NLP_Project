Donkeys seem to innately dislike coyotes, dogs and foxes, which are known predators of livestock in many areas. Donkeys also make good herd protectors because they tend to be aggressive towards intruders.
Female donkeys are best for the job of sheep or livestock protecting. Male donkeys of all ages, both intact jacks and fixed geldings, have been known to injure and sometimes kill livestock either in over-zealous play or aggression.
Mules, which are half-breeds of donkeys and horses, should never be used as guardian animals. A mule is even worse than a male donkey and could stomp and kill the herd with no notice.



Donkeys exist in three sizes: miniature, standard and mammoth. Miniature donkeys are under 36-inches tall and are too small to protect against many predators. Standard donkeys range from 36 to 54 inches (91.4 to 137.2 cm) and are most commonly used as guardian animals. Mammoth donkeys, which often stand much taller than the 54 inches (137.2 cm), are expensive, as well as on the rare and endangered species list.
Donkeys do not necessarily need to be raised with their herd to function well as herd protector. Gentle female donkeys of any age, adopted from a reputable donkey rescue group, often make wonderful guardian animals.

Small pieces of paper, about 1" x 3"
Tape
Toothpicks
Scissors
Straw
A sharpened pencil

, Start in the corner so it forms a cone shape. Get it nice and tight, lining up with the very tip of the lead.


Once you have the cone tip formed, tape it together. Don't worry -- it won't be a perfect cone. You should still have the edge of the paper sticking out at the top.
 You want it the size of your toothpick. To do this:


Insert the tip of your toothpick through your cone.
If you cannot, make a snip ever so small at the tip of the cone.
Reinsert the tip of your toothpick. If it fits snugly, you're good to go.
 Most of it will still jut out. Place it in snugly so a crease or indentation forms lightly where the edge of the straw hits the paper.


At the top of the straw, where this indentation is, cut off the rest of the cone. This will leave you with a tiny cone that'll fit the tip of your toothpick, giving it direction, speed and and the ability to fly.
 You want the end of the toothpick sticking out just slightly. Make sure the tape is securely attached to both the toothpick and the paper cone.
 That's it. Take a big breath, blow in, and shoot whatever target you're aiming for. Try a piece of fruit or some balloons. Definitely not your brother or sister.
 If you want to get fancy, you can create a makeshift dart holster on your straw. This way, you can reload and fire with swiftness and ease. Here's how:


Cut pieces of straw about half the length of the dart.
Place some double-sided tape toward the end of the straw.
Place the pieces of straw in a circle on the tape.
Put more tape on top of the straw pieces, securing them in place.
Insert your darts. They should stay right in place!

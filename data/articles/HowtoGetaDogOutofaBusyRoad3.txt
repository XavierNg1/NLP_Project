 When you rescue a dog, you should take it to the vet. The vet can check the dog for a microchip. If the dog has a microchip, they can be returned to their owner. If there is no microchip, the vet can look the dog over to see if there are any health concerns before you take them home around your own pets.For example, if the dog is a stray or been lost for awhile, it might have parvo, worms, or other diseases. If you take it home around your dog, it might infect them.
 If you still are unable to locate the owner, try calling around to see if someone reported a missing dog. Try the veterinarian practices in town, animal shelters, animal rescues, or other pet organizations. Ask if anyone has lost a dog.Make sure to give everyone you call a description of the dog and your contact information so you can be contacted if the owner looks for the dog.
 When you see a dog on a busy road, it might be too dangerous for you to try to intervene. The dog may also be aggressive or too dangerous to interact with. If this is the case, call animal control. Animal control can come to the scene to help get the dog to safety and prevent an accident.You may consider calling the non-emergency police line to see if there is an officer who could help you get the dog out of traffic without causing an accident.

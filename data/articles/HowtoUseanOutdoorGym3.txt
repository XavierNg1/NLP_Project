 Once you have completed your workout, take a quick walk or jog to help cool down your muscles. Walk or jog around the park for 10 to 15 minutes. This will help your muscles stay warm and keep them from tightening too much.Walking, jogging, or riding your bike home is also a great cool down exercise.
 Your outdoor gym may have a stretching station consisting of a vertical bar with two handles attached to it. Use the station to balance you as you stretch. Slowly stretch your muscles, holding each position for at least 15 seconds. Make sure that you focus on loosening the muscles that you used during your workout.For example, be sure to stretch your legs after doing a leg-intensive workout. Emphasize movements that stretch your hamstrings and calves.
If the gym does not have a stretching station, you can still perform all of the stretches on your own.Avoid any jerking or bouncing movements while your stretch. This can lead to injury.
 A few basic yoga poses are a great way to stretch out your muscles and relax after a workout. Positions like upward-facing dog, downward-facing dog, and childâ€™s pose will stretch and loosen your muscles, while the controlled breathing will help your body relax. Incorporate some yoga poses into your stretching routine to get a physical and mental cool down after your workout.

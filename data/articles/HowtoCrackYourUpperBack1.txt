 This is a fairly safe means of cracking your back, and it can be done at your convenience during the day. However, you do need some range of motion with your arms to do this stretch because you need to place both hands on the center of your back.


To start, place your hands behind your back, one on top of another, at the center of your spine.Press both hands against your spine, and as you do so, lean backward.
Keep going until you hear and feel a slight pop. However, do not lean back past the point where it feels comfortable to you. If you feel pain or discomfort, then stop.;
, If you need to crack your back quickly at work or school, you can do so while seated. This works best if you are sitting in a chair with a short back. While seated, slide your butt toward the front edge of the chair. Then, lean back until your back is touching the back of the chair.








Place your palms on your forehead and exhale slowly.
This will cause your head and shoulders to sink down behind the chair.
Eventually, you should hear a crack.
Do not lean back past the point where it feels comfortable to you. If it hurts or feels uncomfortable, then stop.
 If you're struggling to crack your back while seated or standing, you can try doing it while lying on the floor. However, this exercise will require some more range of motion. You need to be able to grab your toes.









To do this stretch, lie on a padded or carpeted floor. Then, turn over onto your side and bring your knees in towards your chest. Then, extend your legs and grab your feet with your hands.Hold this position until your back cracks, and then turn over to your other side and repeat the stretch.
Do not attempt this exercise if it is painful for you to reach your feet. If you feel pain or discomfort when you attempt the stretch, then stop immediately.

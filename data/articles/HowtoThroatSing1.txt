 Your mouth should be slightly open with roughly a centimeter between your upper and lower teeth.;
, Your tongue should almost touch the roof of your mouth. Don't worry if it brushes it occasionally, just get comfortable with the position.
 Sing and hold a note, just one note, with your tongue in place. You will be playing with this note to create your overtones. Sing from your chest, getting as deep as you can.


Think of saying "oo," (like the sound in the word "cool") with the deepest voice you can.
 Keeping the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth. Think of it as shifting between an "R" and an "L" sound with your tongue.
 Think of moving your mouth from an "E" sound to a "U" sound ("as if saying "see you" without the "s"). This changes the shape of your lips and the "resonance" of your mouth (how sound bounces around inside).


Do this slowly.
 Everyone's mouth is a little different and there is no perfect formula for tongue position, mouth opening, or volume. Start with your basic "oooo" note, and then:


Place your tongue near the roof of your mouth in a "r" position.
Move your lips slowly between the "E" and "U" vowel sounds.
Slowly curl your tongue back and away from the your lips.
When you hear your overtones, stop moving your mouth and hold the tone.

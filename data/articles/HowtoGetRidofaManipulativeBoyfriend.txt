If you're still hesitating at all, strive to see the relationship for what it is accurately.Think about how you feel around your boyfriend.

 If you try to ignore pain, you're only likely to feel it more. Instead of completely ignoring your pain, or trying to push it away when you feel it, accept the fact that breakups come with pain. Even when it's for the best, you will feel sad after you leave someone.Remember, it's better to feel the pain now than let it come out in different ways later.

Remind yourself you deserve love and respect. If your boyfriend was not providing that, that is his problem. He cannot blame it on your behavior. Your boyfriend is responsible for how he treats others.

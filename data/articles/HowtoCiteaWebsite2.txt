 Set aside several pages just for citations. It's easier if you keep all the information in one place. If you want, you can number the citations as you go and then refer to that citation in your notes by the number. Just be sure you don't lose the citation page.
 When citing a website, gather as much information as possible about the webpage:


Copy the URL, which is the website address that is in the box at the top of the browser.
Find the author of the page, which may be at the top under the title or down at the bottom. Sometimes the author's name is on the "About" page.
Write down the website's name, which is usually in the banner at the top of the page.
Copy down the title of the article, if applicable. It should be listed at the top of the page.
Find the publication date. It should be at the top or bottom of the page, but it's not always listed.
Note the date on which you retrieved the information.
 Your assignment or school should specify which citation system you'll be using. If you don't know, MLA is a safe bet for humanities, while APA is most often used in the sciences and Chicago in religion.

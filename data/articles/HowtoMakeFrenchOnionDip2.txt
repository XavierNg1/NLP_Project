 You can use a skillet in a pinch. Make sure the onions are really finely diced to give the dip the right texture. Add a pinch of salt to the mixture and stir it frequently so that the ingredients combine.
 Toward the end of the cooking process, you may need to add a bit of water to keep the onions from burning. You have to be vigilant as you stir the ingredients. Essentially, you're caramelizing your onions here. You can even do this a day or two in advance instead of making the entire dip if you like; this can even give it a richer taste.
 Mince 1 clove of garlic and add it to the mixture, stirring it for a few seconds until the garlic becomes aromatic.
 Take the pan off of the stove to help it cool faster.
 Add the Worcestershire sauce and the thyme (after stripping the leaves away from the two springs) to the onion and oil mixture and stir it until you've thoroughly combined the ingredients. Then, let it cool to thicken. This should take at least 15 minutes or so.
 Now, mix the onion dip with the Greek yogurt, to give it a more healthy and creamy flavor. You can add a teaspoon of celery salt and a few shakes of freshly ground black pepper to give it some extra flavor. If you like, you can wait a few hours (or even a day!) before serving this dish. This can help the ingredients combine a bit and can give it a more tasty consistency.
 Garnish the dish with another sprig of thyme and serve it with whatever dippers you like. Try some veggies, such as broccoli or carrots, or pita chips, instead of the less-healthy (but tasty) potato chips if you really want this to be a low-fat option. You can make this a day in advance, as long as you cover it well and keep it in the fridge.

 Take one end of the lariat in your hand and place it right below your collarbone. Then wrap the rest of the lariat around your neck once (or twice, if your lariat is a lengthy one). Loop one of the strands over in the front. This will secure the lariat in place.This style is easy to create and works great with low necklines, so that the “choker” aspect is clearly visible.
 Grab an end in each hand, then place the center part at the back of your neck. Cross one piece over to the opposite side and wrap it around the back of your neck. Pull the end over your shoulder and allow it to hang there. Do the same thing with the other piece. You can leave it like this, or you can loop one strand over the other to secure it.Allow the ends to hang down after you loop the strands.
 Thread one end of the lariat through the closure on the other end, as you normally would. Then rotate the necklace so that the long pieces hang down your back rather than in front. This works great with a low or open back dress, and can be a gorgeous and unique way to show off intricate details on the back of your dress.It has been a recent trend among brides to use this technique while with their wedding dresses.

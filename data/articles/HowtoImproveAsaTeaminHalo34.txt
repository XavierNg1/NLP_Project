 You are going to want to position your team so that you can actually start team-shooting. The idea behind setting up is that you are able to catch the opponent in a crossfire situation, i.e. 2 or more members of your own team firing on 1 of their team. Set-ups should also be chosen so your team can control key points in a map, e.g. power weapon spawns, power-ups and key geographical points.
 running the flag down long hall on the Pit and spawn trapping the opposition at snipe courtyard etc.
 top blue on Guardian, and there will be slayers focusing on suppressive fire e.g. blue window or S3.
 When the circumstances are in your team's favor everyone must do their best to lock down key areas of the map and prevent the opposing team from breaking the setup. In terms of defensive line of sight, an individual will have certain areas of the map to focus on and this will often involve watching distant areas from which a team could attack e.g. (taking Guardian as a case in point- there may be someone located at bottom snipe lift on an oddball game, this person could defend the blue setup put shots into lower areas of the map e.g. elbow, S1-Underglass).
 without compromising the setup's rigidity (e.g. if all of you push too far out of your setup for whatever reason, if even for an instant, this could result in the opposing team spawning behind you. , Rushing has become a far more effective tactic in Halo 3 than it was in Halo 2, making it an excellent tactic to employ. However, this doesn't mean running at the opponent randomly, which will likely get you killed.


Rushes, though they may seem random, must be well planned. It's best if all four members are alive at the time, so that your rush is as effective as possible. Rushes need to be coordinated and used at the right time, you don't want to be charging your opponent when they have all the power ups and power weapons.
It is therefore more likely to see teams charge when they pick up a power weapon or a power up. As when you are charging you will attract the full attention of the other team, it is good to sneak one of your teammates around their blind side to flank them. This will mean as the other teams focus is in one direction, you can sneak up behind them, scoring easy kills or finishing off your teams' kills.
Also you have to take into account the personality of the team. Some teams are naturally less aggressive than others, so these teams may choose to work more of effective set-ups and use rushes sparingly. On the other hand, there are teams which are made up of more aggressive player, so it would suit them to rush.
 Similar to an aggressive rush, but the tactics and scenario is different. A base raid is usually employed in a one sided objective match (One Flag, One bomb, etc.), double sided objective match, but the team is only defending their base, and VIP.


For this to work, every member will need to be alive, and at least have a single grenade. It is also recommended that you have a power weapon of some sort as well, it will improve your chances. Once you are positive that they are all in the base, set up key entrances.
As for example The Pit base, have one person at main entrance, one person side entrance, and two at opening. Since most of the time the enemy team will have at least one power weapon, your first move is to throw a grenade, or if necessary strafe in and then throw a grenade. The grenade, if it is well-placed, should take out the enemy shields, or at least do some damage.
If one of your members has a power weapon (for this example a rocket launcher) let him jump in and shoot it off. As soon as it goes off rush in. If a team member has another power weapon (shotgun,sword) let him be the first to go in, but have all members immediately follow instead of waiting.
If nobody has a power weapon all rush in with a precision weapon like the battle rifle, or an automatic weapon like the SMG or Assault Rifle.
 This is a special set-up in which you are trying to defend something, or someone at all costs. If you are locking down your base so the enemy can not steal your flag or get the bomb in, YOU MUST NOT BE ON TOP OF THE OBJECTIVE POINT. I can not stress enough on how people think they can crowd around the flag, and a single rocket kills the whole team.


You of course need to be near the position so find a strategic point in which you can see the point you are protecting, but not on top of it. If there is a Sniper Rifle available have a single person go outside and kill the enemies he can.
When defending a point or person, one person should have a Power Weapon, or at least a good course range weapon, even dual-wielded SMGs will be deemed plausible. If you are trying to protect a person (if he is the Oddball carrier or a VIP) this changes a little bit. Find a medium sized area, just large enough that if somebody throws a grenade, everybody is damaged equally.
The only thing is that this area must have minimal points of access. A place where someone can walk through 5 different ways is a terrible strategic position. This area should have a dead maximum of 3 openings, even though it is usually better if there is only two. Secondly, for the person who the team is guarded, find a spot in the room that is both close to their protection, and it is difficult to get hit by a grenade.
Stay calm, stay crouching, and the lock down will usually be successful.
 Make sure that all the members of the team know what their role is in the opening plays of the match, before the game starts. Teams will usually devise strategies to control key areas of the map and power weapons, allowing them to dominate the match right from the beginning. Opening strategies will also be affected by the team you are playing. Aggressive openings can be negated by a good set-up. Similarly against teams who have effective set-ups, you may want to adopt a more aggressive opening strategy, to disrupt their set-up.

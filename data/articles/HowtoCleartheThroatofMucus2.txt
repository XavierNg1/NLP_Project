 Eucalyptus oil has long been used as an herbal mucus relief product. The most effective way to use eucalyptus oil is to line the upper chest area with a carrier oil such as coconut oil and then rub in a few drops of the eucalyptus oil. This might make you cough a little more than expected, at first, but after a while it should help loosen mucus from your throat.









Add a few drops of eucalyptus oil to your vaporizer for another effective treatment option. Do not take eucalyptus oil orally.
 Turmeric also works as an antiseptic. Add a one tablespoon of turmeric and one tablespoon honey to 8 ounces of hot water, dissolving. Drink the liquid, and repeat for best results.
 The list of spicy foods that can aid in mucus relief is long. A few foods you might eat include:









Wasabi or horseradish
Peppers, such as jalapeno or Anaheim
Ginger and even garlic

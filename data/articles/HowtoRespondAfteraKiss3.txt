 If the kiss doesn't feel right for some reason, you don't have to freak out or jump back. When the kiss is over, take one big step back, clearly showing that kissing is over. It can also help to put your hands non-confrontationally in front of you, palms down, to send a message that creates space.
 Passions are going to be high right now, so keep this short and sweet. A simple "I don't think this is a good idea right now," is often the best answer, as it keeps you from being mean or starting an argument. Simply state that you don't want to kiss.


In circumstances where one or both of you are passionate and emotional, it is usually best to avoid giving reasons or starting arguments. Keep things simple for now, knowing you can explain later.
 There is no reason to linger around now. You can explain your reasoning later, if need be. For now, just say that "you're sorry" and move on, separating yourself. It will make it easier for everyone to move on if you're not in the same room., If you have a friend who got a little drunk, and ex who had other ideas, or a platonic buddy who wanted something more, then you may feel comfortable explaining why you don't want to get romantic. Know, however, that you don't owe anyone an explanation if you don't want to give one -- simply not wanting to kiss someone is more than enough of a reason not to kiss them.

,, To save yourself money that you can spend elsewhere while enjoying your vacation, book yourself an interior room. Although this means no balcony or windows, this will encourage you to get out more instead of staying cooped up in your room. If possible, try to get a room in the middle of the ship. The rooms towards the front and the end may cause you to feel more sea sick than the rooms in the middle of the ship.
 You don't want to look back and regret that you didn't go snorkeling in the Virgin Islands, or swimming with dolphins in the Bahamas when you had the chance!

, Chances are you will meet other people that have been on cruises before, and they can provide you with helpful suggestions on where to go and what to do. They might become new friends beyond the vacation!

, Use lots of sun screen, stay hydrated, and be conscious of any foreign foods you are consuming. It is very hard to make the most of your vacation when you are recovering from a severe sunburn, or are sick to your stomach! (You can actually ask your doctor for a patch that you put behind your ear to help with seasickness, if you are prone to that)

, You'll miss half the trip if you spend it in your room sleeping. Wake up and have breakfast at sea, take in the beautiful scenery and watch as your ship docks into the next port. It really is incredible to watch such a large ship pull into their own parking spot! You also don't want to miss out on your day of experiencing wherever your cruise has docked. Remember you only get a few hours to go out and explore... you have to be back to the ship by late afternoon or they'll leave without you!

, Your cruise may have a couple of days when you are cruising at sea.. meaning that you will not stop anywhere that day. Explore the ship, you'll be amazed at what you find! Also, your cruise may provide a daily itinerary, explaining everything that is going on and when it's all happening. Pay attention to these because you may miss out.

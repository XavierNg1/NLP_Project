 EV training begins at birth. If you want perfect control over your Pokémon’s EVs, you’ll want to start from the minute they’re born, when their EVs are still a blank slate. Breed Pokémon in order to get eggs in your desired species that you can raise and train to be the best!;
, Since many of a Pokémon’s initial states (or IVs) are determined by their parents stats, you will want to use Pokémon with good stats in order to breed Pokémon with good stats. Just make sure that you understand how to breed Pokémon.
 Once you have a couple of newborn Pokémon, check their IVs using online tools. Google "IV Calculator" and input your Pokémon stats. The best IV for any one stat is 31, but IVs of 29 or 30 are also usable. Take the best out of several Pokémon or stop when you have one with really good stats.

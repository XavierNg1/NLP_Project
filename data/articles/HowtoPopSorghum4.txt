 Sea salt is a common topping for popped sorghum. Transfer popped sorghum to a large mixing bowl and add about one teaspoon sea salt per four cups (32 grams) of popped sorghum.Sea salt has the same basic nutritional profile as regular salt, but it is less heavily processed., Nutritional yeast is a yellow powder with a nutty flavor. It contains vitamin B12 and other B-complex vitamins. Don’t apply nutritional yeast too liberally, though, since unlike salt and most other sorghum toppings, it adds calories., You could sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over your popped sorghum to give it a bit of the cheesy, nutty taste that Parmesan possesses. Alternately, you could choose another grated cheese like cheddar., After your sorghum is popped, dump it in a bowl and drizzle with canola oil. Sprinkle one teaspoon white sugar and ¼ teaspoon cinnamon over the popped sorghum. Toss or stir with a spoon to coat evenly.

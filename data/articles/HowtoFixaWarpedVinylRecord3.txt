 Leaving them in sunlight or heat can cause warping. Keep the records away from windows and heating. You’ll also want to make sure you don’t leave your records in a vehicle on a hot day., Vinyl records are relatively heavy, and stacking them atop each other puts significant pressure on the records at the bottom of the pile. This can cause them to get warped, scratched and scuffed.Make sure you store your records vertically to avoid this pressure.
 While most people typically store their records in a basement, the typical humidity in these spaces will likely warp the records. Try to find a space you can use that isn’t overly humid. If a basement is your only choice, you should consider installing a dehumidifier to provide a safe place to store your records.

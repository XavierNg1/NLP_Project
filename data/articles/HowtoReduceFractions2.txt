 Using this method, you simply have to choose a small number, such as 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7, to get started. Look at the fractions to make sure that each one is divisible by the number you choose at least once. For example, if you're looking at the fraction 24/108, don't pick the number 5, because it won't go into either number. However, if you're looking at the fraction 25/60, 5 will be a great number to use.


For the fraction 24/32, the number 2 works well. Since both numbers are even, they will be divisible by 2.
 The new fraction will be comprised of the new numerator and denominator you get after dividing the top and bottom of the fraction 24/32 by 2. Here's how to do it:


24/2 = 12
32/2 = 16
Your new fraction is 12/16.
 Continue this process. Since both numbers are still even, you can keep dividing them by 2. If just one or both of your new numerators and denominators are odd, then you can try to divide them by a new number. Here's how the process will work if you're sticking with the fraction 12/16:


12/2 = 6
16/2 = 8
Your new fraction is 6/8.
 Both the new numerator and the new denominator are still even, so you can keep dividing them by 2. Here's how to do it:


6/2 = 3
8/2 = 4
Your new fraction is 3/4.
 In the fraction 3/4, 3 is a prime number, so its only factors are 1 and itself, and 4 is not divisible by three, so the fraction has been simplified as much as possible. If the numerator or denominator of the fraction can no longer be divisible by the number you've chosen, you may still be able to divide it by using a new number.


For example, if you have the fraction 10/40, and are dividing the numerator and denominator by 5, you will be left with 2/8. You cannot keep dividing the numerator and denominator by 5, but you can divide both by 2 to get the final answer of 1/4.
 Work backwards to multiply 3/4 by 2/2 three times, to make sure that you get the original answer of 24/32. Here's how you do it:


3/4 * 2/2 = 6/8
6/8 * 2/2 = 12/16
12/16 * 2/2 = 24/32.
Note that you've divided 24/32 by 2 * 2 * 2, which is the same as dividing it by 8, the greatest common factor (GCF) of 24 and 32.

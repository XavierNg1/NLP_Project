 Start with freshly washed, damp hair. Use a towel to blot away excess moisture.


The hair will be easier to manipulate when it's a little damp, but too much water can weigh the hair down and prevent the style from setting properly. Dry the hair enough to remove dripping water but leave it visibly damp.
Note that this style works best on boys with medium to thick curly hair. You may also be able to duplicate it on wavy hair, but it won't hold well on fine or straight hair.
Additionally, it'll be easiest to create the look when hair is kept a little long.
 Comb a soft hold hair gel throughout the entire hair, spreading it evenly from root to tip.


Squeeze a nickel-size to quarter-size dab of hair gel into the center of your palm. Rub your hands together to spread it evenly across both hands, then run your fingers through the hair to transfer it.
 Use your fingers or a wide-tooth comb to brush the hair in a forward direction, drawing it completely toward the face.


Work around the entire head of hair. All of the hair, including that at the top, sides, and back, should be redirected forward toward the face.
Combing the hair during this step also helps to further spread the gel throughout the locks.
 Grab the hair with your fingers and scrunch it toward the scalp. Work in small sections, and move around the entire head in this manner.


Start at the tips of the hair and push each section toward the scalp. Hold for 5 to 10 seconds before releasing.
As you work, make sure that the hair remains angled toward the face and away from the back of the head.
Make sure that all of the hair gets scrunched in this manner. Don't be afraid to overlap sections, as well.
 Let the hair finish drying naturally instead of using a hair dryer. When finished, the face should be framed by light, messy curls.


The style is complete once the hair is finished drying.

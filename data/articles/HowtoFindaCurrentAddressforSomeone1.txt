 Of all the ways you can find somebody, Google is probably the easiest. But searching for them requires a little more effort than searching just for their name.


For example, we'll use Dave Wilson, who was the drummer for the Cascades back in the 60s. In the Google Search field, we'll enter just "Dave Wilson," with quotes. Using quotes forces the search to use both words in order, so we don't get results that include "Dave Whickershnaker loves to play volleyball but only uses the Wilson brand."
As we can see right away, there's going to have to be some narrowing of the choices. Google returned almost 900,000 results!;
, We'll do this by adding a key association that is unique to Dave Wilson — his band, the Cascades. This time we find what we're looking for.


We now know what happened to Dave Wilson — he passed away in 2000.
 Sometimes the easy way turns up nothing. The person you are looking for may have changed their name, may have gone "off the grid," or may have passed away before leaving their mark. When that happens, there are alternatives.


Google "people search," and you will be presented with a list of sites that will help you find who you are looking for, many of them advertising free searches.
Be aware that "free" often means they will get you part of the way there—and then you pay for the actual contact information.

 The most popular design is a solid color and a matching pattern, but you can use two different solid colors instead. You will need about 1 yard (0.92 meters) of fleece for each color/pattern.
 This is very important. You won't be turning your pillow inside out, so the right sides need to be on the outside from the very beginning.
 If you already have a pillow that you would like to use, put it down onto the fleece, and trace around it using a piece of chalk. If you don't have a pillow, simply draw a large circle or heart onto the fleece.
 The larger your shape/pillow are, the longer your tassels should be.
 Do not cut out the smaller shape. You will be using that as a guide for your tassels. Also, be sure to cut through both layers of fleece at the same time. This ensures that both shapes match up.
 Depending on the space between them, this will be anywhere between 2 and 4 inches (5.08 and 10.16 centimeters). Once again, be sure to cut through both layers of fleece at the same time. # Start tying your strips together. Take your first strip, and tie it to the one just below it in a tight double knot. Keep tying the strips together in a similar fashion until you have four left.


If you are using a pillow form, put the pillow between your two pieces of fleece first.
 At this point, your pillow is all done and ready to show off! If you feel that the fringe is too long, you can trim it shorter with a pair of scissors.

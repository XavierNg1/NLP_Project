 Typically, when properties are divided into lots, your county records this information. Often, a plat map is used, which indicates the boundary lines and measurements of each property. If you have a plat map for your property in your possession, you can easily review it to determine your property lines.
 A metes and bounds survey is a very common type of deed for recording property borders. If you have a metes and bounds survey record of your property, you will need to read it carefully, as this type often relies on physical landmarks and may be very vague.For instance, a metes and bounds survey may state that a property line extends “fifty meters from the tall oak, then a 90° W turn, then seventy meters to the stone wall.” However, the “tall oak” or “stone wall” mentioned in the deed may no longer exist. For this reason, a metes and bounds survey deed is not always reliable.
 Typically, property lines and plot divisions are recorded as plat maps or deeds and archived with the local county recorder or assessor. If you do not have a map or written record describing your property lines, ask the applicable office for a copy.Many counties also allow you to search databases online to find a plat map or survey deed for your property.There may be fees for obtaining these records, which can vary widely depending upon your location.

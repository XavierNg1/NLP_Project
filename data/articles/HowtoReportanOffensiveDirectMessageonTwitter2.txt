 On your phone’s home screen or app drawer, look for the button sporting the Twitter logo (a white bird against a blue background), and tap on it.
 Once your Twitter login screen is up, enter your email address or username, and your Twitter password into the designated boxes. Afterwards, tap on the “Sign In” button.
 Once you are on your main Twitter feed, look for the white-envelope icon at the top of the screen. Tap on it to load all of your direct messages.
 Simply look through your messages to find the person whose message you want to report, and tap on his or her name to display the conversation containing the unwanted direct message.
 When you are inside the conversation, scroll through until you find the section that you want to report. Once you find the message, tap and and hold until a pop-up menu appears.
 Tap on the option on this pop-up list that best describes what you think of the message, and the report will automatically get sent to Twitter for an investigation.

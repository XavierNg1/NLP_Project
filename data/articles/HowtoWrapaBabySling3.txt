 For newborns and babies up to a year old, the cradle hold position works well. Starting with the basic wrap, you’ll have two layers of fabric across your chest. Pull on one layer, and it will open like a pouch.
 Hold your baby against your shoulder, lean back a little, and slip his or her feet in the sling, toward your midsection.
 Turn your baby so that his or her arm and side are resting against your body; then, slowly lower your baby’s bottom on the pouch.


Make sure that your baby is facing the opening of the pouch.
 Take the fabric around your waist and pull it over your baby’s body.

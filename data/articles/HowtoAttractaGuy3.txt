 Finding and sticking to an exercise routine leads to higher levels of energy, better sleep, and a clearer complexion. That's not even including the health benefits and trimmer waistline!


A simple thing like going for a walk every day contributes to overall health. If you have time (and the ability) for a daily trip to the gym, great! But if not, stay active with smaller things: walk the dog, play tennis, or go swimming.
 A girl with interests is an interesting girl. Having your own identity is key to attracting a man: If even you don't know who you are, how can he?


Find hobbies. There are loads of things you're good at. Once you find the things you enjoy, you'll find guys with similar interests. Having things in common makes it easier to communicate and start a relationship.
Your passions should include other relationships. Don't neglect your friends and family in concentrating on finding a guy. Surrounding yourself with others who care about you will help you grow and become a more well-rounded, positive person.
 A balanced, nutrient-rich diet works wonders on the body and mind. Your body is a temple--don't put things into it that are harmful.


Getting enough vitamins and minerals will make your hair and nails grow faster and thicker, in addition to your skin glowing and looking healthier. This means loading up on the fruits and veggies and cutting down on the processed goods.
Kick those nasty habits. Drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes adds years to a person's appearance. Not to mention the bad breath and body odor.

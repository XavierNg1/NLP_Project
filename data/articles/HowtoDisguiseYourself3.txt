 Give your new identity a name and develop a believable story for yourself. This will help you "get into character" better, and make your performance more natural. Develop a different sense of humor than you would normally have, start listening to different music, and developing different attitudes. If you're naturally liberal, imagine that you were a conservative Republican and adopt the style, attitudes, and demeanor of that character.


You can even consider working an accent into your disguise. Practice while you're by yourself and only speak in that accent in public. Change your accents periodically with different people to keep them guessing.
 Looking older or considerably younger is a particularly effective way to fool people. Dying your hair gray when you're young and working a stooped, hunched walk with a cane into your routine will render you unrecognizable to people who know you.


Putting a pebble into your shoe is uncomfortable, but if you're committed to disguising yourself, it can be a good way to ensure that you'll walk differently. Brace your knee with a brace to give yourself a natural limp.
 The most important part of a disguise is to not to attract attention to yourself. "Hiding in plain sight" is the best way to disguise yourself. Avoid making eye contact with people you know, keeping your head low and walking calmly and slowly. Looking as if you're busy, as if you're on your way somewhere in particular with something to do will ensure that you look inconspicuous.
 If you want to go for broke, consider dressing either ambiguously or as a convincing member of the opposite sex. Switch back and forth to keep your disguise varied.

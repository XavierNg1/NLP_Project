 Many large stores have coin-counting machines, which rapidly count inserted mixed coins and returns paper money. However, these usually charge you a percentage of your total coin value as a fee, or gives you full value only in the form of a gift certificate to certain retailers. Certain banks have similar services, but usually only for customers.


In Canada or the eastern U.S., even non-customers can use the coin-counting machines at BMO (Bank of Montreal) or TD Bank, although there may be fees.Find the nearest location of a BMO coin-counting service here.
 Coin-sorting machines for home use separate coins of different types into their own stack, or even into prepared paper wrappers. These range from a stack of cheap plastic trays with different sized holes, to machines that cost several hundred dollars or euros, and sort the machine in fast or visually appealing ways.

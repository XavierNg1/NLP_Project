 For example, you can type the number 2 into cell A1, the number 6 into B1 and then add them together by typing =SUM(A1:B1) into cell C1. Note that to add cells together you may alternatively type a comma between the referenced cells , but use of the colon allows you to select a range of cells whereas the comma requires you to list each cell individually. You can also sometimes type the numbers themselves in order to simply add numbers, but this method won't keep track of a referenced cell's value in the event it changes.;
, For example, you can type the number 6 into cell A2, the number 2 into cell B2 and then add them together by typing =SUM(A2:B2) into cell C2. Now you have a second sum that can subsequently be added to the first sum. Note that you may repeat this process with multiple rows in the event you wish to subsequently add more than two sums together.
 In the given examples, this would entail typing =SUM(C1:C2) into cell C3 to produce an answer of 16 based on the addition of sums 8 and 8. In the event you wish to find the total of more than two sums, simply adjust the cell range accordingly .

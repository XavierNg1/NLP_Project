 You can use the View Side by Side feature in Excel to view two different Excel files on the screen at the same time. This has the added benefit of scrolling both sheets at once.
 You should now have two instances of Excel open on your computer.
, You'll find this in the Window section of the ribbon. Both workbooks will appear in on the screen, oriented horizontally.
, The workbooks will change so that one is on the left and the other is on the right.
 When Side by Side is enabled, scrolling will be synchronized between both windows. This will allow you to easily look for differences as you scroll through the spreadsheets.


You can disable this feature by clicking the Synchronous Scrolling button in the View tab.

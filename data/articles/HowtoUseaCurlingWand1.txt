 Always start with neat, tangle-free hair when using a curling wand. Use your regular brush or comb to gently tug out any tangles so your hair is smooth going into the process.If you use any products, like a leave-in conditioner, apply them while brushing out your hair.;
, Curling wands usually provide several different settings, ranging from high to low. For the most part, start with the lowest heat setting possible as this provides the least amount of damage to your hair. If you find your hair is not curling at the lowest setting, increase the heat gradually as you curl.It can take some trial and error to find the right heat setting for your hair, so be patient. As you get used to using your wand, you should find a heat setting that works for you.
 Never apply any type of heat treatment to your hair without using a heat protectant first. You can purchase a heat protectant spray or gel at a salon or department store. Apply it to your hair according to instructions, working it in from your roots to your tips to ensure full protection.








If you also tend to use hairsprays or styling gels when styling your hair, apply these as well.

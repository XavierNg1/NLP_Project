 Morning sickness is a very real thing. Many expectant mothers feel morning sickness during the early part of the day; it's a feeling of nausea and an aversion to smells that previously had no effect on you, such as the smell of strong coffee. You may even be vomiting in the morning, which will be a sign that something is up.
 Sore and tender breasts are a common symptom of pregnancy. Throughout your pregnancy, your breasts will get larger and your nipples may darken and grow. However, sore breasts are also a sign that you're about to get your period., Many women are also fatigued during the first trimester of their pregnancy. If you're feeling unusually tired while getting plenty of rest and not feeling overly burdened for any reason, then your pregnancy may be the cause., If you're urinating a lot more frequently without any reason you can think of, or if you're suddenly constipated while previously not having any trouble with your bowels, then you may be pregnant.
 Pregnancy comes with some serious hormonal changes that can have a major impact on your mood. You could be crying one minute and then feeling ridiculously happy the next minute for next to no reason. See if you're suddenly sobbing while watching a corny movie or seeing a sad story on the news. Of course, again, mood swings are also a pre-menstrual symptom.
 If you're suddenly getting dizzy when you stand up quickly, walk up stairs, or just for no reason at all, then you may be pregnant.
 You may experience a number of these symptoms and can still not be pregnant. The best way to know if you're pregnant and if what you see on your underwear is really implantation bleeding is to leave it to the health care professional. Make an appointment with your doctor, at your local hospital or clinic.


You can also start by taking a home pregnancy test, but you have a better chance of getting accurate results if you go to a doctor or a clinic.

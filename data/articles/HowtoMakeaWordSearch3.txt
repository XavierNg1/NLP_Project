 Place the list next to your grid. You can label your words #1, #2 etc. if you want to. Write your words out clearly so that the person doing the word search knows exactly which word he or she is looking for.
 Put one letter in each box. You can write them backward, forward, diagonally, and vertically. Try to evenly distribute the words throughout the grid. Get creative with your placements. Make sure to write all of the words that you have listed next to the grid so that they are actually in the puzzle. It would be very confusing to be looking for a word in the word search that isnâ€™t actually there.


Depending on who you are giving the puzzle to, you may wish to make your letters larger or smaller. If you want your puzzle to be a little less challenging, like if you are giving it to a child, you might consider writing your letters larger. If you want your puzzle to be more challenging, make your letters smaller.
 Once you have finished writing in all the words, make a photocopy of it and highlight all of the hidden words. This will serve as your answer key so whoever does your puzzle will be able to see if they got everything right (or can get help if they are stuck on one word) without the confusion of the extra, random letters.
 Once you have written all of your chosen words into the puzzle, fill the still empty squares with random letters. Doing this distracts the person from finding the words in the search.


Make sure that you do not accidentally make other words out of your extra letters, especially other words that fit into your theme. This will be very confusing for the person doing the puzzle.
 Only do this if you are planning on giving your word search to more than one person.

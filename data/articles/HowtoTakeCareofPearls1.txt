 When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume. Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry.;
, These pieces are more subject to scratching since they sit on your hands. Never wear these pieces when you anticipate working with your hands, and limit them to special occasions. Especially if you know you are going to do a rough job like playing sports, bathing or grooming your pet, take them off immediately.
 A pearl's luster can be damaged by even the smallest amount of perspiration. Removing your sweat from the pearls after each use helps preserve their luster. You can also dab a drop of water on them and clean them off. Don't scrub too hard, even though it is soft cloth!

, Acid can come in the form of sweat, perfume, fruit juice, vinegar, or a number of other substances. The acid will break down the crystallized calcium of the pearl, ruining its luster and causing a very long-term damage.

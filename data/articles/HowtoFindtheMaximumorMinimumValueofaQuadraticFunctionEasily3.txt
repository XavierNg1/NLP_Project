 Write your quadratic function in general form, f(x)=ax2+bx+c{\displaystyle f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c}. If necessary, you may need to combine like terms and rearrange to get the proper form.Begin with the sample function f(x)=2x2−4x+1{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}-4x+1}.
 Using basic first-year calculus, you can find the first derivative of the general quadratic function to be f′(x)=2ax+b{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=2ax+b}.For the sample function f(x)=2x2−4x+1{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}-4x+1}, find the derivative as:


f′(x)=4x−4{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=4x-4}




, Recall that derivative of a function tells you the slope of the function at that selected point. The minimum or maximum of a function occurs when the slope is zero. Therefore, to find where the minimum or maximum occurs, set the derivative equal to zero. Continue with the sample problem from above:f′(x)=4x−4{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=4x-4}


0=4x−4{\displaystyle 0=4x-4}


, Use basic rules of algebra to rearrange the function and solve the value for x, when the derivative equals zero. This solution will tell you the x-coordinate of the vertex of the function, which is where the maximum or minimum will occur.0=4x−4{\displaystyle 0=4x-4}


4=4x{\displaystyle 4=4x}


1=x{\displaystyle 1=x}


, The minimum or maximum value of the function will be the value for f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} at the selected x{\displaystyle x} position. Insert your value of x{\displaystyle x} into the original function and solve to find the minimum or maximum.For the function f(x)=2x2−4x+1{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}-4x+1} at x=1{\displaystyle x=1},


f(1)=2(1)2−4(1)+1{\displaystyle f(1)=2(1)^{2}-4(1)+1}


f(1)=2−4+1{\displaystyle f(1)=2-4+1}


f(1)=−1{\displaystyle f(1)=-1}




, The solution gives you the vertex of the maximum or minimum point. For this sample function, f(x)=2x2−4x+1{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}-4x+1}, the vertex occurs at (1,−1){\displaystyle (1,-1)}. The coefficient a{\displaystyle a} is positive, so the function opens upward. Therefore, the minimum value of the function is the y-coordinate of the vertex, which is −1{\displaystyle -1}.

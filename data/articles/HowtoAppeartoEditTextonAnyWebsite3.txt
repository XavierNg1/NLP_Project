 In Safari, click the “Safari” menu on the menu bar at the top of the screen. From here click “Preferences,” and then select “Advanced” from the menu at the top of the Preferences window. Check the box at the bottom of the window that says, “Show develop menu in menu bar.” There will now be a “Develop” menu in the menu bar, between “Bookmark” and “Window.”, Navigate to the website you want to appear to edit. If you want to edit text, highlight the words you want to change, and right-click them; if you want to edit a photo, just right-click it without highlighting.


To appear to edit a photo, you will need to upload the photo with which you want to replace an existing one. You have to be able to replace the URL in the original code with a new URL.
 When you right click, a menu will pop up. Click “Inspect Element.” A new window with lots of HTML will pop up inside the current one.


You can also open Inspect Element window by click the “Develop” menu, and selecting “Show Web Inspector.” Then find the text you are looking for by pressing Command+F on a Mac or Control+F on Windows, and type in the text you want to change. This is a more roundabout method.
You can also open Web Inspector with the shortcut Alt+Command+I on a Mac, or by pressing F12 on Windows.
 If you are changing text, simply overwrite the words you highlighted with whatever you want to replace them with. If you are changing a photograph, replace the URL with the desired new one, leaving the rest of the code alone.If you make a mistake, just press Command+Z on a Mac or Control+Z on a Windows to undo it.
 Click “Enter,” and close “Inspect Element.” The website should now appear to have the text or image you changed. You have not truly edited the website, of course, and these changes will disappear when you refresh the page.

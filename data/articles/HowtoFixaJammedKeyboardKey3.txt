 If you spill a drink on your keyboard, unplug it and wipe it down.
 Make sure the keyboard is unplugged first, or your laptop is powered down. If the spill is mostly on top of the keys, use a cotton swab and rubbing alcohol to clean the keys., Make sure they are free from stickiness., Going around the edges should help with sticky keys, as it releases the bottom part of the key from the keyboard., Once the alcohol is dry, check your keys to see if they are better.

 Put the whites in a bowl and mix them together until they create a shiny solid foam (if you think it's ready, just tip the bowl upside down over a plate. If it didn't move at all, it means it's ready).
 Mix together using a hand mixer. Add sugar and mix it together until all is nicely combined., Mix it together––using a spoon only. Make sure you reach the bottom of the bowl, as the sieved flour is heavy. It might take a while but it is worth it., Grease it with some margarine or unsalted butter and pour the cake mix into the tin or pan (to approximately 3/4 of the height; if you add more, it will pour out of the tin during baking)., Once the oven is ready for our cake, set it in the middle of the shelf and let it bake for about 40 minutes. Keep an eye on the cake though as the baking time varies from oven to oven.

If it seems to be burning at the top just reduce the oven temperature slightly.
 Once the baking time is up, take a skewer and pierce the middle of the cake with it. If you can still see some raw cake on the skewer, then leave the cake in the oven for further 5 to 10 minutes. If not, remove from the oven., When cooled, it's ready for afternoon tea.

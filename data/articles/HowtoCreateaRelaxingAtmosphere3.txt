 Even though creating a relaxing atmosphere is important, the most relaxing environment canâ€™t make up for feeling physically and mentally drained. Coupling mental and physical care with your relaxation strategies will enable you to reap greater benefits.
 Aromatherapy for relaxation has been proven to work to relieve both stress and pain. Calming effects come from oils like vanilla, rose, or geranium. Less physical pain and stress will help you relax and find calm.


Mix your aromatherapy with water in a spray bottle and keep in your car or in your purse of briefcase. Spritz your wrists and neck periodically throughout the day to benefit from the relaxing scents while you're away from home.
 Calming exercises like yoga or Tai Chi can help you relax, reduce stress, and reap health benefits like lower blood pressure and lower pulse rate.

 You’ll need a 1 lb. bar of beeswax, ½ cup of almond oil and ½ cup of coconut oil.;
, This will be the tool you use to melt the bars down to create your own slice of skin paradise.
 You could also use an ice cube tray to make smaller lotion bars but find a mold at home that works best for you. Also, silicone pans (with fun shapes like stars or flowers) are also fun and could be used if you are making lotion bars to live as gifts.

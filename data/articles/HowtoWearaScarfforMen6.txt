 Hang the scarf off the back of your neck so that the ends drape straight down over your chest.


The front of your neck should still be uncovered at this point. It should essentially look the same as the classic drape style.
This style can range in warmth from slightly warm to very warm, all depending on how tight you make the loops.
Choose a long scarf for this style. One that is 72 inches (1.8 m) works well. A longer scarf is especially good to have for a twice-round.
For a traditional look, choose a scarf with fringes. A scarf with rounded edges will also work, though.
 Pass the longer end over your neck, draping it over your opposite shoulder.


The long end should now hang straight down over your back. The short end should remain in front.
 Cross the long end over the back of your neck and over the shoulder it originally hung across.


Both ends should now hang straight down across your chest.
Tug on both ends of the scarf to even them out. Also tug on the ends to adjust the wrapped portion around your neck. A tighter loop will be warmer, but a looser loop can seem more easy-going and stylish.
This completes the once-around style. Depending on how much length your scarf has or how cold the weather is, you may wish to continue further with a twice-around style.
 Wrap the long end of the scarf around your neck once more, crossing it over the front and back of your neck as well as both shoulders.


When finished, both ends should lie straight down across your chest.
Tighten or loosen the loops around your neck to create the look and level of warmth you desire. Make sure that the scarf lies flat against your neck and chest instead of bunching up or twisting.
Both the once-around and twice-around styles can be worn both inside and outside your overcoat.

 This works best in the elementary school. Take one day and spend 20 minutes with each grade. During this time, talk about different fire prevention subjects such as stop, drop and roll, and how the fire trucks work. This is a fun way to teach the kids about fire prevention and gives the guys a chance to be a kid again.;
, This is an a great PR idea.
 Let the public come into the station and see the trucks. Let the kids try on the gear. If you are a volunteer department, this is a good way to recruit members.
 While this may not be a way to tell the public how to prevent fires, it is a great way for the firefighters to celebrate their jobs and have fun.

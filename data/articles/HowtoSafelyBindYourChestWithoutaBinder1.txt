 When binding, a lot of people put emphasis on the fact that you need to use a safe method of binding. However, it's also important to remember that you need to take precautions yourself. You can have the best professionally-made binder in the world and still break a rib. Since you're not using a professional binder, follow the basic rules of binding safety at all times when you are binding.

Don't engage in activity that gets you breathing hard. (This can include exercise, sexual activity, lifting heavy objects, or anything else that causes you to breathe more quickly or heavily than normal.)

Never bind using bandages or duct tape. Although it may seem like an easy solution, this method can cause permanent damage to the breast tissue, ribs, lungs, and nipples. There is no way to be safe when binding in this way, and more often than not, it can result in worse, more lasting pain than gender dysphoria could ever cause.
Don't wear your binding method for more than 6-8 hours, and never wear one while asleep.
If you begin feeling short of breath, or experience any chest pain while binding, remove the binder immediately.;
, If you feel like your binding method isn't getting you anywhere, it's perfectly fine to try another one. However, it's not safe to combine two completely different methods of binding, as one may be more effective than the other and be just as dangerous as using bandages or double-binding (which can also result in lasting bodily damage). Stick with one method only, never two.

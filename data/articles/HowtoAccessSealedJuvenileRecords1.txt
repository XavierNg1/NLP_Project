 Most states have specific forms you must use to access juvenile records.


Juvenile court records include any documents or other information maintained by the court in connection with a juvenile delinquency proceeding. The records are kept at the court house where the proceeding occurred and maintained by the clerk of that court.;
, You must include information describing the records you want to view and why you want to view them.


When you complete your form, you must sign it. Your signature indicates that the information in your petition is true and correct and is submitted under penalty of perjury. If you knowingly include any false information on your petition, you will be guilty of a crime.Because of the confidential nature of juvenile records, some jurisdictions also will require you to sign a stipulation agreeing not to provide copies of the records to anyone else or to use them for any reason other than the reason you stated in your petition., Typically your records will be kept in the county where the juvenile court proceeding took place.


You can view your own juvenile records, as can your attorney, parents or legal guardians.To view the records, you must present your completed request form along with some form of valid, government-issued photo identification. If you are seeking your own records, your name typically must be the same as it was when the record was created. If your name is different because, for example, you were married or adopted, you may have to show additional documents such as a marriage license or adoption decree to prove the name change., After your request is processed, the records you requested will be mailed to you.


Keep in mind that it may take a few weeks for the court to process your request and send your records. If you need to seek them more quickly, you can ask the clerk if expedited processing is available. You may have to pay an extra fee for that.

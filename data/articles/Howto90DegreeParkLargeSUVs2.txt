 As you search for an open parking space, keep your SUV approximately 7 to 8 feet away from parked vehicles. When you locate an empty bay that is large enough for your vehicle, slow down and signal your intention to park. When your side mirrors reach the center of the space immediately next to the space you intend to park in, come to a complete stop.


If there is a parked car in the space immediately next to the space you intend to park in, align your side mirrors with the center of the vehicle’s license plate., Quickly turn your steering wheel 2 ½ times towards the direction of the space. If the space is on your right, turn the wheel to the right; if the space is on your left, turn the wheel to the left. When your surroundings are clear, proceed forwards into the open space. When your side mirrors reach those of the cars parked next to you, press the brake pedal., To straighten your tires, turn your steering wheel 1 ½ times in the opposite direction—if you initially turned the wheel to your left, turn it 1 ½ times to the right; if you initially turned the wheel to your right, turn it 1 ½ times to the left. Put your SUV in park, exit your vehicle, and lock it., If your SUV is not straight, correct your parking job before leaving your vehicle. Exiting your SUV when it is too close to another car may result in damages.


Shift your car from drive to reverse.
Turn in your seat and use your mirrors to check for pedestrians and other vehicles. Once it is clear, pull out of the space away from the object your SUV is too close to.
Continue to move backwards until your SUV is centered and straight.
Shift your SUV into drive and turn the wheel so that your tires are straight.
Use your side mirrors as you pull forwards into the space.
Put your vehicle in park and exit the SUV.

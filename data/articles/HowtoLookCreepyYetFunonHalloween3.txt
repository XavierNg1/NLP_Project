 Like the other two, witches can have any color hair. If your hair's greasy, that's OK.
 You can leave your skin as it is, unless you want to be one of the tremendously silly witches out there on Halloween who paint their skin bright green with yellow warts all over the place. If you want to look cool, use your normal skin care products (foundation, concealer) and leave it there.
 Try going for something that's a little lacy, a bit vintage maybe. Obviously, invest in the usual pointy witch's hat. Wear black opaque tights or white ballet tights, teamed with pointy black Goth boots to finish off the look for a fun, Gothic look.
 The usual - that is black kohl-rimmed eyes and black mascara, black eye shadow maybe, purple under-eyes. You know the drill! Use a clear lip-gloss, or perhaps for the full-on Goth look black lipstick and smudged eyeliner.
 If you want, at the beginning of year leave on outside and it'll rot until you like it. Those plastic imitations are OK, but hardly real-looking. Try for wood and prickly hairs for the mop. Every so often, burst out cackling and for your trick-or-treat bucket have a small plastic cauldron.

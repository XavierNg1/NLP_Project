 You should use pepper-spray on an intruder only if you will be able to escape after doing so.


The fumes can be overwhelming, and you don't want to be trapped in a room with them., While it's generally recommended that you try to escape or cooperate with an intruder, you may be forced to defend yourself.If you need to fight, you should fight to incapacitate the intruder so that you can escape.


Aim for the groin, neck, face (eyes, nose, mouth) or knees.Where you should hit the attacker will depend on where the intruder is positioned near you. If he's not standing right next to you, for example, then try to kick his knees (hard and fast), rather than moving closer to strike him in the neck., Hold your dominant hand open and flat, with your fingers straight and close together, and your thumb out. Then forcefully jab your hand into the intruder's neck.You may also be able to incapacitate the intruder by making a forceful upward thrust with the heel of your palm into his nose., You may also be able to throw your elbow up into the intruder's neck, face, groin, or even stomach.


Use your leverage, and throw your body weight into it., While you can attempt to gouge your attacker's eyes or nose with your hands, scan the room quickly to see if you can use something else as a weapon. For example, it's a good idea to keep a pen or your car keys near your bed.


If you're woken before you can make it to your safe room or grab another more suitable weapon, you may still be able to inflict serious damage with these items.
 While you may be forced into a physical confrontation with the intruder, take the first opportunity to flee. Make as much noise as possible, in the hopes that you'll alert a neighbor or a passerby to your situation.

 You can do this using a handheld mixer or an electric mixer fitted with paddles. To make the mixing even easier, cut the butter into small cubes first.
 Keep mixing until both are evenly distributed throughout the cream cheese and butter mixture. There should be no streaks or swirls.
 If the frosting is too thin, add in some more sugar. If the frosting is too thick, add some more milk. Mix well after each addition.


You may not end up using all 3 cups (375 grams) of confectioners' sugar.
 Make sure that the cupcakes are completely cool first, or the frosting will melt. You can spread the frosting on using a spatula, or you can pipe it on using a piping bag and decorator's nozzle.For a final touch, consider sprinkling the finished cupcakes with a light dusting of cinnamon, cocoa powder, or nutmeg.

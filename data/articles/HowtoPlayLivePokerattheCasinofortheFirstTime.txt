 Most establishments will have a front desk where you can talk to a floor person who will either put you in a game immediately, or place your name on a waiting list.;
, Make sure they don't have any rules you are or were not aware of. This will save any embarrassing moments at the table if you don't understand something that is obvious to the regulars.
 If you decide to play No Limit, it's suggested buying in for the minimum amount. If you are going to play Limit, then 20-25x the big blind is a good amount.


Once you've been seated and begin playing, you will soon win your first pot in live poker. As you are stacking your chips, always remember to tip the dealer. This is common courtesy, and at low limits a tip anywhere from $0.50 to $2.00 is plenty, although the amount is completely up to you.
 However, always give the dealer a chance to help you first, and then go to the floor if the dealer isn't answering the question to your satisfaction.
 Win money, interact with the other people at the table and loosen up.

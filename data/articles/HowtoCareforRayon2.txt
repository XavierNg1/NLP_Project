 Use a low setting on your iron. Higher temperatures may burn the rayon. Iron the piece in sections and avoid pulling on the piece while ironing to prevent misshaping.Turn a rayon garment inside out when ironing, as the area that comes in contact with the iron may develop a slight sheen.
Do not use any steam when ironing. Rayon loses strength when wet, and adding steam may make the fabric easier to damage while ironing.
 If you want to avoid the shine that comes with ironing rayon, iron using a protective barrier. Place a hand towel over the section you intend to iron, and iron the rayon with the towel on top.Only use a clean, heat resistant protective barrier, such as a cotton fabric. Some recommend using aluminum foil, but this can heat the foil and lead to potential burning.
Keep the iron set to low. While it may take a little longer to smooth out the piece, adding excessive heat to rayon is still potentially damaging.
 These types of sprays are available at most grocery or home goods stores. They are formulated to work on most types of fabric, and can help get the wrinkles out of rayon without applying heat.


Rayon treated with the spray should be set flat until the spray is dry, so as to avoid excess pulling on the relaxed fibers.
Always read the label of the spray to see if it states that it is not safe for use on rayon.

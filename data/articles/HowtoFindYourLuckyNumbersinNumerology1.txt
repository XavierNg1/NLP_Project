 Your Life Path Number is considered the most significant of your core numbers. It offers your life's potential outline, the path you will take through life and the themes that will shape it. This number reveals what lessons you will learn, challenges you will face, and opportunities you will receive in the form of a broad outline. Ultimately it is your choice to deviate from this number's lesson, but within Numerology it is believed that following the path of your Life Path Number is the most fulfilling choice to make.


Any positive traits associated with this number will manifest as unique skills and capacities that aid you in all aspects of life.
Negative traits associated with each number show you personal deficits. Or rather, point out areas in your inner and outer life that need attention in order to find balance.;
, In essence, you add each number in your birth date together until a single digit is achieved. The method however is very specific. We'll use the birthday December 17, 1986 as an example.(Note: Check the section near the bottom of the page for more information on each number you calculate.)


Reduce the month, day, and year to single digits. It is common for some numbers to take multiple reductions. In such cases, repeat the same technique until a single digit or Master Number is achieved.

Month: 12 = 1+2 = 3

Day: 17 = 1+7 = 8

Year: 1986 = 1+9+8+6 = 24 = 2+4 = 6



Next take the resulting three single digits or Master Numbers and add them: 3+8+6 = 17 = 1+ 7 = 8.
And so in the instance of December 17, 1986, we get a Life Path Number of 8.
 Containing a host of set meanings - often of great purpose and power - the numbers 11, 22, and 33 are considered Master Numbers. When calculating in numerology, the general rule is that the month of November (11), as well as the 11th and 22nd days of any month, are reduced to 2, 2, and 4 respectively. However, in the case of Life Path and Birthday numbers, an exception is made.For example, if the above example were instead November 17, 1986, our initial reduction would result in: 11+8+6 = 25 = 2+5 = 7 yielding a Life Path number of 7.
 1+2+1+7+1+9+8+6. Instead the month, day, and year are first reduced on their own, and then added together. This is symbolic and connected to the Period Cycles, which divide your life into three sections of growth, thematic meaning, and challenge.

 Most people’s bodies actually manufacture plenty of vitamin K. If you regularly eat a balanced diet and you don’t have any gastrointestinal ailments, you’re probably getting enough vitamin K. Some signs that you have a deficiency can be:Easy bruising
Gastrointestinal bleeding
Excessive menstrual bleeding for women
Blood in the urine
Osteoporosis
People most at risk for vitamin K deficiency are people with chronic malnutrition, alcohol dependency, and people whose bodies have a problem with the regular absorption of vitamins.
 Some people actually need to limit the amount of vitamin K they consume. If you are taking prescription anticoagulants, which are meant to interfere with the role of vitamin K, you’ll need to keep your dietary intake of vitamin K purposefully low and consistent day to day.If you’re on prescription anticoagulants, don't take vitamin K supplements.
 Sometimes taking antibiotics when you’re sick or have an infection will kill these bacteria, which can lead to a mild or temporary deficiency. However, even this is most common in people whose levels of vitamin K were already low.Eating fermented foods such as yogurt, kombucha, and miso or taking oral probiotic supplements can help boost the bacteria in your gut if they’ve been depleted by antibiotics.

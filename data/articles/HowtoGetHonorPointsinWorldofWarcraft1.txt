 If you kill an enemy player on the opposing faction and the kill is counted as an honorable kill then you will gain a few Honor Points.;
, Before you go slashing on an enemy you sighted, remember that a few criteria needs to be met for a kill to be counted as honorable.


If the player you kill is 10 or more levels lower than you, your kill will not be counted as honorable.
Killing players who are under the effect of resurrection sickness or players who have recently entered a new battleground/zone will not grant honorable kills either.
Generally, if you want to obtain honor points through killing other players all you have to do is kill other players that are close to your level.
 If you believe that the enemy meets the criteria, go ahead and kill. Repeat the steps to gain more Honor Points.


Most kills count as honorable, with the few exceptions mentioned in step 2.

 Calm upset or explosive guests by taking responsibility for the problem or issue. Apologize on the hotel’s behalf. When communicating with your guest about the issue, respond to your guest in a friendly, calm manner and remember to smile.For example, if your guest is upset about their room not being ready, apologize and offer them a complimentary drink or appetizer at the hotel’s restaurant or bar while they wait for their room.

 Even if you are short, you can love your body. Think about all of the things that your body provides you with; you have arms and legs, means of transporting yourself from place to place, and even the ability to have and communicate thoughts and feelings.
 You probably lament not being able to reach the top shelf in your kitchen (or even the middle one) and having trouble seeing over the steering wheel in large vehicles. But have you considered the advantages of being short? Thinking of these examples may help you improve your thoughts about height:


Short athletes, such as boxers, are often faster and more agile than their larger counterparts.It is much easier to have clothing tailored to be shorter than to make them longer.
Shorter people are often mistaken for being younger than they are.
Shorter people don’t have to worry about bumping their heads on low doorways or tree branches.
Shorter people can sometimes buy children’s clothing or shoes, which are often less expensive than adult’s clothing.
 When you are in a public place, notice the variety in sizes, shapes, and details of people’s appearances. Part of what makes you unique is your appearance, an element of which is your height.
 If your negative thoughts are coming from the outside—from other people—then you should remove those people from your life, or at least confront them about their negativity. Increase the time you spend around people with positive, happy attitudes.
 If you are worried that people will say you are short, just say it for them. Give yourself the nickname “shorty.” Call yourself “fun-sized.” Find a way to accept your height as part of who you are, and just go with it… that will make you much happier than trying to fight something that you can’t change.

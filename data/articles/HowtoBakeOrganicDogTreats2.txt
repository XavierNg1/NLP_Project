 Jerky treats are a great alternative to raw hide or bones that will give your dog something to chew on and provide protein for their muscles. Purchase several pieces of boneless organic chicken from your local grocery.You can also make a similar treat with sweet potatoes which are also high in protein.
 Lay the chicken breast on its side and slice it into 1/8 inch strips. Lay the strips on a baking sheet, preheat your oven to 200 degrees, and bake for 2 hours.

The jerky should be tough and dry. Bake for another 20 minutes if it is still juicy and soft.
 Store the jerky in an airtight container in the fridge for at least several days before feeding it to your dog. This will make it more chewy.

Frostbite, which is when the skin and underlying tissues are damaged (usually in the extremities) from cold exposure, has symptoms that include "pins and needles" sensations followed by numbness.
Hypothermia is when the body's core temperature drops significantly below normal.;
, One thick layer of clothing is not as effective in insulating your body against the cold as several layers are.


The first layer should be a synthetic blend that can wick sweat away from your body.
The second layer of clothing should be wool.
The third layer should be a weather-proof outer layer followed by a down coat or vest.
Lean people may need more insulation than someone who is heavier.



Avoid caffeine or alcohol when working in the cold.



Feet and hands can become vulnerable to injury, such as frostbite and chilblains as the heat of the body moves toward the core in cold weather.
More than 40% of your body heat may be lost if your head is uncovered. Wearing a warm cap that covers your ears is very important when working in the cold.
Wear boots that are waterproof and insulated.
 Wet conditions and low windchill can decrease body temperature very quickly, causing significant risk if you work outside. The warm air surrounding your body is taken away more quickly as the wind increases.


Erect a shelter to work out of the wind if possible.
If you are on a route where you are exposed to cold outside conditions, stop as frequently as possible in a warm area, such as a gas station, to warm up.

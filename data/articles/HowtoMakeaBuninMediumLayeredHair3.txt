 Use a comb to gather your hair on top of your head and secure it with a hairband. Make sure the sides, back and top are bump-free and the hairband is nice and tight, so your bun will stay in place.Ballerina buns are usually positioned right on top of the head, but you could just as easily position your bun further back on your head. Just make sure it's securely in place.
If you have a few strands of hair that won't fit in the hairband, pin them up using bobby pins.
 This will add some volume and make your bun appear bigger, so it looks like you have long, thick hair. To tease, lift your ponytail up straight. Insert a comb near the tips and comb back toward the roots. Repeat until your entire ponytail has been teased.









You can skip this step if you prefer a sleek, smooth bun. Just keep in mind it will be smaller than the average ballerina bun, since your hair is on the shorter side.
 Just use your hands to pull your ponytail apart so that it resembles a fishtail. Make sure each section is the same width.
 Twist the section as you wrap to create a pretty twirled effect. Wrap it close to your hairband up against your head. Use several bobby pins to secure the ends in place. This is the first half of your ballerina bun.
 Twist the section as you wrap and tuck it close to your head around the exposed part of the hairband. Tuck in the ends and pin them in place with several bobby pins.
 Check your hair in the mirror to see if it has the right appearance, and use pins to tuck in any loose ends. Finish the look with firm-hold hairspray to hold your bun in place.

 You might not be certain if you are experiencing gastroparesis These symptoms include:Fullness: You may feel full after eating a small amount of food. This happens because your stomach takes longer to process the food, which keeps your abdomen feeling full.
Gaseous discomfort: As mentioned above, gastroparesis causes food to remain in the stomach instead of going into your intestines. This delay can cause a buildup of gas.
Nausea and vomiting: You may feel nauseous, or even vomit, after eating. This nausea is caused by the buildup of food and secretions in your abdomen.
Lack of appetite: When you constantly feel full after small amounts of food, you are less likely to feel hungry during normal meal times.
Weight loss: When you feel full all the time, you are less likely to eat often, which can lead to weight loss.
Heartburn: When your abdomen is full of food build up, your stomach might send food back up your esophagus; this is known as regurgitation. The food is generally mixed with acidic gastric juices that can cause a burning sensation known as heartburn.
Acid reflux: the lining on your esophagus and throat are irritated and erode when digestive acid and gases back up to the esophagus.
 There are some people who are more predisposed to developing this condition than others. These people include:


Diabetics.
People who have had surgery that involved the abdomen.
People taking certain medications that may slow down the digestive process.
People experiencing an infection that involves part of the digestive process.
 While smoking and drinking alcohol are both bad for your general health, they are particularly bad to take part in if you have gastroparesis. Both of these substances can increase heartburn and reduce your overall health.

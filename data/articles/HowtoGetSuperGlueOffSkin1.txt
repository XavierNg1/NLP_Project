 Acetone is the substance in nail polish remover that helps dissolve superglue for removal. You need an acetone-based remover in order for this method to be successful.Check the ingredients label of your nail polish remover. Acetone should be listed here, usually towards the top of the list.
If your nail polish remover does not have acetone, you can try another removal method, or you can purchase one that does contain acetone. Acetone-based nail polish remover is readily available in most department stores, or you can purchase straight acetone at your local home improvement store. Wear gloves and a mask while using the acetone.;
, It's safe to use acetone-based remover on small patches of skin, but keep it away from your eyes and mouth. Apply the remover to the affected area with a cotton swab or paper towel.








Nail polish remover can eat through the finish on tables and furniture. If you're working at a table, lay a protective covering down over the area. It's best to work over the sink.
Do not use this method to remove superglue from sensitive areas like the eyelids and lips.
 After a few minutes, you should notice the superglue is turning white and beginning to flake off the skin. You can now begin gently peeling the glue off the affected area. It should come off fairly easily at this point.








If the glue is not coming off easily, you can use a nail file to rub the glue off the skin. Be careful when working with a nail file, as you do not want to accidentally rub off a layer of skin. Stop if you start to feel pain.

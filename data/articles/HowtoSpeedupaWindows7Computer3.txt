 Besides taking up hard disk space, old programs may still be running processes in the back, even if you never use them. This is especially true of old antivirus programs or other utilities.


New computers often come with programs pre-installed. Many of these are trials that need to be purchased in order to be used. If you don’t intend to use these programs, remove them to free up space.
 Select Control Panel, and then click “Uninstall a program” under the Programs section. If you are using Classic View, open Programs and Features. This will open a list of the programs installed on your computer. Depending on how many programs you have installed, it could take several minutes for the list to fully populate.
 In the menu bar, an Uninstall/Change button will appear. Click it to begin the uninstall process. Each program has a slightly different uninstall method, but most are automated.


There are also several free software such as Revo and Advanced Uninstaller which deep clean traces from the Registry which are not removed by the built-in Windows software.

 Before cooking your fennel, preheat your oven. Make sure you know how to tell when your oven is completely preheated. Some ovens have a thermometer inside while others may make a noise., Make sure to spread the fennel out evenly. You do not want any of the pieces of fennel touching or overlapping., Drizzle about an eighth to a quarter cup of olive oil to the fennel. You should also add salt and pepper to taste. Toss the fennel pieces with your hands.Use a quarter cup olive oil if you're cooking more than one bulb. For a single bulb, an eighth cup of olive oil should be sufficient.
 Cook the fennel for 30 minutes. Then, flip over the pieces of fennel. Cook them for an additional 30 minutes. When the olive oil is completely cooked, the edges should be crisp and brown., You can sprinkle some parmesan over the fennel for seasoning. Use parmesan flakes, adding as much as you desire.Serve the fennel immediately after cooking it. You can keep leftovers in a covered container in the fridge.

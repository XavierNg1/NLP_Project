 For easy transfers, use a square lampshade with a flat, even surface so you don’t have to worry about rounding your stamp over a curved surface. Of course, most lampshades are curved, so with these, use one with a smooth surface to make rounding your stamp easier.Lampshades aren’t that expensive, so if your lamp has a ribbed or other irregular surface, keep the lamp and replace the shade.
 If you purchased a new lampshade for this project, go ahead and skip this step. However, if you’re stamping an old one, remove any dust or dirt from the surface, since these may block your paint, create incomplete prints, and/or stick to your stamp. Wipe it down with a duster and/or vacuum the surface.Use your vacuum’s dusting brush or upholstery attachment.
 If you like chaotic, random designs, feel free to stamp your lampshade wherever your whim takes you. But if you want to create a more structured look, figure out what pattern you want to follow beforehand. Use tape to form a neat grid or borders for an alternating pattern between rows or columns.Also tape the edgings to protect them in case the stamp overlaps them in your top or bottom row.

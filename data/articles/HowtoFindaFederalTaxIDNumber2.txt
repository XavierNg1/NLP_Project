 Anyone with a Social Security Number (SSN) can use it as a tax ID.Your employer is required to send you a W-2 form each year by the end of January. This form lists your SSN as "Employee's social security number" in box "a" at the top of the page., If you do not have any W2 forms, you can request a copy from any current or past employer. All employers are required to keep this information for at least four years after you leave the company., If you cannot find your social security card, you can apply for a new one online using a driver's license or state ID.


You can also fill out this application and bring it to a Social Security office, along with a birth certificate and photo ID., All individual tax forms (1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ) list the taxpayer's SSN in the top right corner of the first page.
 If you do not have an SSN but have filed taxes in the past, those forms used an ITIN (individual taxpayer identification number).Any ITIN used in 2013 or later is still valid, unless the IRS has sent you a letter telling you to renew it.The ITIN is entered in the box labeled "social security number." For example, your old Form 1040 lists your ITIN on the first page, in the top right corner.If you received a letter telling you to renew your ITIN, or if you have not used an ITIN since before 2013, fill out form W-7 to request a new ITIN. It takes about 7 weeks to get a new one., If you cannot find your ITIN, call 1-800-908-9982. This number is only available from the US.

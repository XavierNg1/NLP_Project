 Excessive washing of your hair can strip it of natural oils which are needed to keep you hair in best condition. This applies to all hair types.;
, Hair becomes exceptionally soft, smooth and shiny when you use special hair treatments. It can be a leave in treatment or a wash out treatment.
 You can use basic ingredients from your fridge to make hair masks which add nutrients, shine and softness to your hair. For example, Mix together half an avocado, an egg, and 3 tbsp of olive oil. Once mixed, put on your hair from root to end and leave in for two hours, then rinse out in cold water using shampoo and conditioner.
 Using hair curlers, hair straighteners, rollers, hair gel, hair spray, hair dryers etc can damaged your hair much more than you would expect. The styling products you use dry out your hair causing split ends and damage to the hair.
 Brushes are great to get out tangles and knots, but do not over brush, it will strip hair of natural oils and cause split ends.

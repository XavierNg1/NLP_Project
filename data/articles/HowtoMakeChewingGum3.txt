 The sap from sweet gum trees has been used for medicinal purposes and to make chewing gum since ancient times. The sweetgum is a deciduous tree commonly found in North America.
 Sweetgum sap flows under the bark. You may be able to find a spot where the bark has been torn off and the sap is accessible. If not, use a pocketknife to remove the bark from a small area. You'll see runny sap underneath.


Don't remove too much bark, or you'll damage the tree.
Choose a spot high off the ground so that the area isn't accessible to animals.
 Over the course of a few days, the exposed sap will begin to harden into a gum. Come back to the spot after about 3 days to check it. If the sap is still runny, wait a few more days. If it's hard, it's ready to be made into gum.
 A pocketknife is a good tool for this. Catch the pieces of resin in your hand or a small container.
 Place the pieces in your mouth and enjoy your minimalist gum.

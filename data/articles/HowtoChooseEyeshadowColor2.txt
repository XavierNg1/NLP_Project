 A simple way to determine skin tone is to look at your veins in natural lighting. If they appear blue or purple, you have a cool skin tone, which usually applies to those with fair or pale skin. However, if your veins appear green you have a warm skin tone and may have olive skin. If you can’t determine what color they are you may have a neutral skin tone and a darker complexion. However, keep in mind that those with darker skin can also have a cool or warm skin tone.


If you are still uncertain of your skin tone, question whether you tan easily or burn when in the sun. If you tan easily, you likely have a warm skin tone. However, if you burn, you probably have a cool skin tone. You can also decide based on whether you look best in silver or gold. Warm skin tones look best in gold, while cool skin tones look best in silver. Neutrals, on the other hand, look the same in both. If none of these methods seem to work, or you can’t tell, you are likely in the neutral category. , You want to work with the undertones in your skin, which tend to be yellow or golden. Using colors like bronze, light pink, coral, or light green will help enhance your natural coloring., The natural undertones for cool skin types are blues and pinks, so try colors like silver, teal, lilac, or gray to play up your features., Those with neutral skin tones are fortunate enough to have no clear undertones, which means they can pull off almost any color. To work with natural coloring, however, try taupes or creams. , These colors will fade and wear off throughout the day. Instead, go for richer colors like jewel tones (emerald, violet, ruby, sapphire), which will appear more muted on darker skin and last longer., These colors will not only wash out your skin, but they can also make you look bruised. To avoid this, go for softer pastels like lilac, rose, or baby blue. These colors will still stand out against your skin without being overbearing.

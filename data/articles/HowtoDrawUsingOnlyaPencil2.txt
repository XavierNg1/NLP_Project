 For each area in your drawing that would have color, lightly sketch using a dull pencil to create the base tone. Don't make it dark yet.


Work in small circles to create an even tone.
 Drag the tissue across the graphite. You could also use your finger, although that leads to oily paper and fingerprints. If you get any shadow out of the lines, and you don't want it to be, simply erase it.
 Sketch in layers; don't press hard for one layer, or you will create an indent in the paper. Consider your light source and where the darkest shadows would be.
 Erase parts of your shading in shine shapes. This can be used to make metal, dew, and other surfaces.


Keep in mind that, for example, hair isn't very reflective, while eyes are. Look at reference pictures to see how reflective a surface is.

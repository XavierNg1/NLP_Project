 To get started, simply put your username and password into the box. If you have an Arby/Mopod code, put it in as well!;
, Just click on the map and then go to the Puzzle Palace. The Puzzle Palace resembles a castle with diamonds.
 Each puzzle gives you five Rox.
 Go to your map and click Main Street. See the couple eating? Click their basket that has Boshlings stealing the cakes and you can start playing. Play as long as you like. To make it easy on yourself, just play the first level over and over again until you see a sign that says you've hit the Rox limit.
 However, it is limited to members only. It can be a fun game if you play your favorite songs.
 The only thing is that those games take a lot of work to get Rox. You can also get 200-300 Rox if you go to the port but you have to be a member to go and click on the trees every day to get Rox!

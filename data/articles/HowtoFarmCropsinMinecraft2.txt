 You can find pumpkin seeds in chests in abandoned mineshafts or by finding pumpkins in the wild and crafting pumpkin seeds. Melon seed can be crafted from melons found in jungle biomes, found in abandoned mineshafts, or traded from villagers.


Pumpkins and melons will grow on an open dirt block that is immediately adjacent to the seed.
The seed will not produce any additional pumpkins or melons until the current ones are harvested.
There is no need to replant them, as growing does not consume the seed.

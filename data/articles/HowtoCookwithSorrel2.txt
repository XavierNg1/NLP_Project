 Place the pan on the stovetop and turn it on to medium-high. Take 3 tablespoons (44.36 ml) of butter and place it in the hot pan. Mix the melting butter with a fork or spoon until it liquefies. Turn the heat down to medium once it's melted.


If the butter starts turning a dark brown, you are burning it.
 Add 2 cups (50 g) of fresh sorrel leaves, 1/4 cup (5 g) of chervil, and 1/2 cup (15 g) of chives to the melted butter and allow the sorrel to wilt. This should take approximately two minutes.You can replace chervil with fresh parsley.
 Pour 1/2 cup (118.29 ml) of heavy cream over the wilted sorrel leaves. Bring the sauce to a boil then reduce it to a simmer for about five minutes., Remove the pan from the heat and taste it with a spoon. Add salt and pepper to taste. This sorrel sauce tastes best over fish like salmon, halibut, cod, and sole.

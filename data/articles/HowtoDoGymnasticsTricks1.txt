 Warm up the muscles in your body with 15 minutes of cardio. Do what you enjoy as cardio can be repetitive. Whether you jog, run on a machine, or walk up stairs, make sure you loosen up your muscles, slowly working them up for more vigorous activity..


Add squats, knee jumps, or jumping jacks to increase the blood flow and intensity of your warm up.;
, The bridge is a stretch that looks exactly as it sounds. Lay with your back on the floor, knees bent, feet planted, and hands palms down with fingers pointed at your feet. You should look like you are about to crawl on your back but create a bridge instead by lifting your back off the ground and pushing down through your palms and feet.Keep your elbows pointed at the ceiling and try to stretch your back as much as possible. With time and practice, your flexibility will improve and you’ll notice that your back will bend more and more.
Don’t force your back to bend past its capacity. Back injuries can be very debilitating.
 Take a step forward into a lunge position. Touch the ground with your fingertips or as low as they will allow. Inhale and slowly straighten the front leg, raising your butt. Exhale as you stretch the front leg then lower yourself back into the lunge position.Stretch both sides at least 4 times each.
 From a standing position, reach your arms overhead, clasping your fingers together but keeping your pointer fingers out and extended. Inhale and stretch as long and as tall as you can while you simultaneously bend at the hip to one side. Breath slowly and deeply for 5 seconds and return to a standing position with your arms overhead.Repeat the standing side stretch on both sides of your body.

 Let's say you want to go by sea.;
, Go through the portal that is under a sign labeled Sixtopia. Talk to the lady and get your ticket to Orbis. The boat leaves every 15 minutes, at the hour, 15 after, 30 after, etc.
 This should lead you to Orbis Tower. Make your way all the way down the tower then go through the circle on the first floor. Go down that map and you will see a portal with some water halfway up it. Go through the portal.
 Keep making your way right in Aqua Road until you see a big glowing book. Press up on that book. That should take you to Korean Folk Town.
, To get to Korean Folk Town go to the bottom of the Library and use the large book as a portal.

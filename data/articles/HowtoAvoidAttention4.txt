 Many mass-transit options provide their down times. Take advantage of this and try to minimize the number of people you may encounter.
 When you are not in the same place very long there will be less time for people to notice you. Some studies suggest dissimilar movement hinders communication between two people.If you are at a crowded social gathering, casually walk from place to place as if you are trying to get somewhere.

Change your route to normal daily locations. Try the interstate one day, side roads the next. The key is to make it more difficult for someone to perpetually be where you are.
Make unexpected stops. Try going to a quiet library or coffee shop periodically. Go somewhere out of the ordinary on a whim. Be unpredictable so you are an unknown to those around you, and difficult to find for those who know you.

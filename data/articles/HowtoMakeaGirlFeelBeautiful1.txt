 It's easy to say, "You're pretty," and it's just as easy to brush that off. But if you're more specific, you show you notice what makes her beautiful, and she may start to believe what you say.So instead of saying "You're beautiful," try something like "Your smile lights up a room" or "I love how your hair turns red in the sunshine.";
, Don't criticize her appearance, of course, but also help her to stop talking negatively about herself, too. When she starts complaining about her appearance, point out what she's doing and replace it with a compliment.For instance, if she says, "I can't stand my love handles. They're so chubby." You can say, "Don't take yourself down. I love your body with all its curves."
If that doesn't work, help her examine how often she talks negatively about herself. Maybe she doesn't realize she is saying negative things so often, so if you gently point it out, it may help her take control of the situation. If you can, turn it back on her. That is, encourage her to talk positively about her body when she starts talking negatively., For instance, saying something like "You're skinny for your age" implies that a person old. Also, try to not use compliments that imply she wasn't as beautiful in the past, such as "You look so lovely now that you've lost some weight!"

, You can show someone you appreciate her beauty by how your eyes light up when she comes near or when she catches you looking at her when she's distracted.

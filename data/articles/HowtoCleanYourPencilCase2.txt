 About four tablespoons of baking soda for a quart of water should be more than enough if the only plastic you’re cleaning is the case. You can do this in a bowl or plastic tub in the sink., You can leave the case open inside the water or pour the baking soda water directly into the pouch. The baking soda will remove any smells, so you want to make sure the water gets inside of the case.
 Use warm water with enough detergent to make the water soapy. Run it under the water to make sure all the baking soda is gone, then drain the water you used.
 In a clean bowl, add a small amount of detergent to warm water. Dip this cleaning cloth into the water. Use the cloth to scrub out any leftover marks. Be sure to reach into the corners to make sure you’ve removed all of the dust and shavings that will make a bigger stain in the future.Some plastic scratches easily, so make sure your rag is soft. If you can’t reach a part of the case, use a soft brush such as a baby toothbrush.
 Put the case under a small stream of warm water. Turn the case over and open it up. Make sure all the soap is gone before you’re done.
 Use the dry end of a soft cloth. Get down into all the corners and the outside of the case.


Some plastic can develop water spots or mold if left alone, so don’t air dry.
 If a bad smell hasn’t gone by this point, crumple up newspaper, push it into the case, then leave it in an enclosed space such as in a kitchen container. The newspaper has the ability to absorb odors.

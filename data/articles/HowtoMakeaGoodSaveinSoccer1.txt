Stretch. Stretch the muscles in your legs, which are most important.



 


A simple warm-up that is used by even professional goalkeepers is this: Have a teammate throw a ball at you, with you standing in the middle of the goal. Then, before touching the ball, you have to touch one post, then you can try stop it.






Another good way is to simulate an attack - Have a couple strikers play down the field, slowly making their way to you. Then, they can try to score. This will give you chance to practice those dives.






Practice hand-eye co-ordination. Do this by having a teammate punt (Like a drop-kick but not letting it hit the ground) the ball near you, and try to catch it.






A practice game before the game is actually really good. You can practice every skill you will need on the field, so you'll have plenty of chances to make a good save.

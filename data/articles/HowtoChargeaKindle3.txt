 If the battery is completely drained, the screen may read, “Critical Battery. Your battery is empty. To continue using your Kindle, connect to a power source.”


In this case, your battery is completely drained from lack of use or frequent use.
Since it doesn’t have much battery power to even recognize a power source, it may take several tries and several hours to get it to turn on again.
 You will want to use the power adaptor method, because it charges more quickly than the computer method.
 If you do not see the yellow light when the Kindle is connected to the micro USB port, power adaptor and outlet, it is not charging. Try it several times until the Kindle recognizes the power source.
 Don’t try to get onto the Kindle during this time. However, you should check to ensure the yellow light is still on.
 Check to see if it turns on by sliding the Power button on. It may work and you can use your Kindle.
 You will need to start the process of rebooting the Kindle into recovery mode.
 Hold down the Home key for 30 to 45 seconds. When the Kindle screen starts to flash, you should release the Home key.
 Hold the R key until the screen flashes again.
 Set the Kindle to charge for several hours. Check on it to ensure the yellow charging light is on.


Eventually, the Home screen should pop up again and you can start using your Kindle.
The Critical Battery screen may flash again during this process.

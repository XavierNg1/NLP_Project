Talk to skipper and find some eggs.
Open them and go to skipper to get furniture.
If you sell 1-5 pieces, you will get about 60,000 to 70,000 bells.
Repeat this process and you will get rich.
 If someone wants to have something from you, see if you can get them to buy it instead. If they don't want to, don't bother giving it to them; someone else interested will come along., Get some cheap bargains and see if you can get a profit on it. If you can't sell it at the flea market, sell it at Nooks, but the main goal is to pay off your rent first so try to pay off at least maybe a day otherwise you will be there forever paying it off 5,000.

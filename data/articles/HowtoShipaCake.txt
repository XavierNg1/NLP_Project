 If shipping cake with icing, check that the icing used is the stiff kind. Cake shipping methods usually work best with cakes that use fondant icing, since the fondant would hold its shape better even when subjected to a warm shipping trip. Shipping is not advised for cakes which are fluffy and have a lot of frosting, as this would be more likely to be messy, and the frosting would tend to melt in warmer temperatures.;
, The cool temperature will also maintain the freshness of the cake. Once you are ready to pack the cake for shipping, carefully wrap the frozen cake in plastic saran wrap from top to bottom, making sure that the plastic is wrapped firmly enough to provide ample support to the cake. After, wrap the cake in aluminum foil to maintain the cold temperature.
 Surround the cake with gel packs to help keep it cool while in transit, and Styrofoam packaging peanuts to cushion the cake and prevent too much movement. If a Styrofoam cooler is not available, you may also place the cake in a sturdy cardboard cake box. For added protection, wrap the Styrofoam cooler or cake box further in bubble wrap.
 Place Styrofoam peanuts around the cake package on all sides, as well as on the bottom of the box. Fill the box with the peanuts such that it becomes a sturdy insulation, ensuring that the cake package does not move around.
 Do not use cellophane tape or masking tape, as these may be removed easily. Apply multiple layers of tape to all the seams.
 Mark the box with “THIS SIDE UP” and with an arrow pointing up, by using stickers or by writing it with a permanent marker. Make sure to do this on each side of the box. Mark the box with “Fragile” and “Perishable” as well.
 This will minimize the transit time and the chances of the cake getting damaged. Also consider getting insurance for the shipment.

 Many prefer electric meat grinders because they're easier and faster, but also more expensive ($80+). Manual meat grinders are 'a thing of the past' but can still be found online, in shops, and on sites like eBay and Craigslist for relatively cheap (under $40). Be sure to choose a grinder that comes apart completely so that it is easy to wash.;
, If preparing a meal for an animal, use raw bones (only raw bones - never cooked!) and use the soft, pliable bones that the animal would normally eat in the wild. Poultry wing tips, the ribcage, necks and backs are all good choices. Do not attempt to grind up leg bones or anything larger or thicker than your thumb - these may prove to be too difficult for the grinder, and while perhaps gnawed on, the actual bone would not likely be consumed by a cat, anyway (too large & coarse). Fish, poultry, rabbit & rodent bones are all okay to grind.

Marrow, blood, and other tissue will be present in some bone. This is OK and healthy for the animal to consume.

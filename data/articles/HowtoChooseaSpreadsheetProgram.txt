New users will probably require much less in terms of capability from spreadsheet software than "power" users. Microsoft Works, that program included with the Windows operating systems, will probably be more than enough to meet their needs. Users looking for a spreadsheet for a Mac might look into NeoOffice, the Mac operating system version of OpenOffice.



 


You may need to purchase additional training for your staff if the program you choose is too difficult for your average user to learn.






Those who are already proficient in a big-name, purchased spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel will likely have the least trouble adapting to a new program.

Computing "in the cloud" means that very little information is stored on your computer. This eliminates the need to back up data and makes sharing information between team members much easier.
Installed programs typically have better developer support and can ensure a higher level of security for the data involved.
Some installed programs are specific to a certain operating system. For example, there is no Mac version of Quattro Pro.
A cloud-based system ensures that there will be no compatibility issues between the PCs and Macs in your group. This is especially good for those independent contractors who work with several clients and other freelancers.



There are new free cloud-based computing options introduced every day. Some of the more popular cloud-based options without an upfront or subscription fee are Google Docs, Zoho and EditGrid. Choosing a free spreadsheet solution allows you to divert those budgeted funds into other matters.

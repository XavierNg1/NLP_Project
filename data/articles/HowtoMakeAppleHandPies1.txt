 Add 2 cups (480 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt, and 1 tablespoon (12.5 g) of sugar to a large bowl. Mix until all of the ingredients are well blended., When the flour, salt, and sugar are mixed, use a pastry cutter or fork to cut ¾ cup (145 g) of all-vegetable shortening that’s been chilled and cut into cubes into the dough. Work until the shortening is broken into piece size pieces, and the mixture is crumbly.If you prefer, you can cut the shortening in using a food processor. Make sure that a metal blade is inserted, and pulse it several times until the dough mixture has the proper consistency.
 Once you’ve cut the shortening into the dough mixture, slowly drizzle in 4 to 8 tablespoons (60 to 120 ml) of ice cold water and mix it in with a fork. You want to add just enough water to make the dough stick together, so pour it in just a tablespoon (15 ml) at a time.To test that the dough is moist enough, remove a marble size piece and squeeze it in your hand. If the dough holds together, it is ready. If the dough is still crumbly, continue to add water.
 When the dough is moist enough, remove it from the bowl and shape it into a ball with your hands. Next, use a rolling pin to flatten it into a disc shape.If you don’t have a rolling pin, you can use the bottom of a heavy pan to flatten it.
 Wrap the flattened dough disc in plastic wrap. Place it in the refrigerator, and refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes.If you want to make the dough ahead of time, you can chill it for up to 2 days.

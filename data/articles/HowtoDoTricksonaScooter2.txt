 Again, place your front foot on the front of the deck and rest your back foot slightly behind your front foot. Make sure your stance is solid and you feel well balanced.
 Push off with your back foot and get moving at a comfortable pace. Stay relaxed and make sure that you’re heading straight forward. The more speed you build up now, the faster and more impressive looking your tailwhip will be.
 Do the simple jump trick by crouching down, jumping up and pulling the scooter behind you. You’ll need plenty of air time to perform the tail whip, so make sure you jump as high as you can., With your back foot, kick the tail of the scooter out, either right or left. The direction doesn’t matter, choose what is most comfortable to you. Since the scooter deck is attached to a pivot point (the handlebars), it will move away from you on a circular path., Once you’re airborne and you’ve kicked the tail to start the circle, you’ll need to make sure the deck returns under your feet so that you can land. Momentum will do most of the work, and the deck will continue to rotate back to you, but you’ll need to help it out by moving the handlebars. Push them in a circular motion, moving in the same direction that the board is moving in., The deck will continue turning, so you need to catch it with your feet. When the deck returns to its original position, catch it with your front and back foot. Return to your original stance, with front foot facing forward and back foot just behind it.
 Stay relaxed as you fall to the ground, and make sure your stance is solid. As you connect with the pavement, let your knees buckle a bit to absorb the shock. Straighten up your handlebars a bit if you need to, you may have changed course in midair on accident.

 Teaching your dog the basic commands like sit, stay, and come will help you control your dog's behavior at any restaurant. If your dog does not know these commands, it is recommended that you teach your dog these commands yourself, or place it in a basic obedience class before bringing it to a restaurant.Find a basic obedience class at your local pet store, or ask your veterinarian for recommendations.
 While you are at the restaurant it is important that you keep your dog on a short leash, for example, a leash that does not exceed four feet. You will be able to control your dog better with a short leash. A short leash will prevent your dog from bothering other guests and from retrieving fallen food scraps from other tables.Do not attach the leash to the table. Instead, attach the leash to your chair or to your belt loop.
 If you know that your dog is restless, or is easily tempted by food, people, or other dogs, then choose a quiet place to sit in the restaurant. Choose a spot that is off in the corner and away from high traffic areas. This way, your dog will be less tempted by external stimuli, and you will be able to keep your dog's behavior under control.

 Hold on to these rings until you reach a save post.;
, After passing by the save post and saving your progress on the level, a group of spinning stars will hover over the post. These stars will allow you to enter a bonus stage.
 Jump inside the save post to enter into an alternate dimension with a bonus stage. Follow the rules of the stage to beat it properly.
 You will have to finish the stage without losing or messing up too much in order to receive this emerald; if you die or do poorly on the level, you won't be able to win it.
 Enter and complete six more bonus stages, finishing them well and without dying or messing up. After each one, you should receive another Chaos Emerald, so keep going until you have all seven.
 Go back into a normal stage after you have successfully collected all 7 Chaos Emeralds. Grab 50 rings, and then either jump or double jump to become Super Sonic!

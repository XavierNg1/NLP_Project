 He does this by baring his teeth and growling, drawing his lips back into a snarl, and wrinkling his nose.


Other signals include staring directly at you with dilated eyes, raised hackles, and his ears drawn back and down. The dog may also take a pace of two towards you, but moves with a hunched, crouched posture, rather than relaxed strides.
 Of course, not all dogs will be extremely afraid, but may be only anxious or a little fearful. In this situation you may get leakage signals (subtle signs that the dog did not deliberately give out) that clue you into how the dog is feeling.These include changes in behavior such as excessive yawning, licking his lips, pacing restlessly, becoming hypervigilant, barking or snapping, or refusing a much-loved treat.
 You can also get clues from the dog's posture as he walks. A fearful dog tends to skulk, with his head and rump down, moving in slow motion with a lowered body, almost as if creeping along.

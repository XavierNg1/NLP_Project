 It may require extra steps such as the addition of sugar into your beaten eggs. Be sure you have all the required ingredients at hand and are familiar with the instructions in your recipe before you begin.;
, You may do this by sharply tapping the egg on a flat surface or against the lip of a container, and then gently pulling the two halves apart.
 There are several ways to do this, but the easiest is to very carefully pass the bright yellow yolk of the egg from one half of the shell to the other over a bowl, allowing the clearer white of the egg to dribble out. Do this several times until most of the egg white has dripped into the bowl. Place the yolk in your second bowl. Be careful not to allow any pieces of eggshell into either bowl. Carefully pick them out if necessary.
 Take the whisk firmly but gently in your dominant hand. An overhand grip works best. With your other hand, grip the bowl firmly so as not to make a mess.
 Lower your whisk into the egg whites and begin to move it in tight circles by moving your wrist sharply up and down in a circular motion. Start slowly and then speed up. You don't want to go too fast, and consistency is key., The recipe you are working from will probably describe to you the ideal consistency of the egg whites. Take your whisk out of the bowl and point the whisking end up to form peaks, allowing you to judge the stiffness. Whisking can be tiring, and you may be tempted to switch hands. This is fine as long as both hands can keep up a consistently quick rhythm.


If the recipe asks for soft peaks, the peak at the end of your whisk will be formed, but will melt back into itself.
If it asks for firm peaks, the peak will hold a shape, but the tip will droop downward.
If it asks for stiff peaks, stop when the egg whites firm up and begin to form peaks that stand up sharply on their own.

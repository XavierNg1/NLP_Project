 It can be tough to recognize when someone is toxic and not in your best interest, especially if it’s someone you’ve known a while. One sure sign of a toxic, negative person is listening to your gut and how they make you feel. You may dread being around them and exhibit signs of nervousness anticipating meetings like sweat palms, nausea and a general uneasy feeling.
They make you feel badly about yourself. Toxic negative people tend to exude pessimism and can even be physically or verbally abusive. If you find any of these traits in your relationship with a family member or friend, you may need to evaluate your relationship.;
, People who are negative and toxic tend to have one-sided relationships. Sometimes it can be hard to be a observer of your own relationship. Watch how they interact with their other friends, particularly whether they talk negatively about other people. Those who feel the need to bring others down may do the same to you. They always worry about themselves. Whether you’re telling them about your day or your own feelings, toxic people seem to turn around them quickly to themselves. They also tend to be greedy and less concerned with your well being than their own. This sort of one-sided relationship is a sign of problems.
 When you realize that someone dislikes you and you’d be better off without his or her negativity, make a change for your own good. This important step means you’re ready to seek positive change in your life and surround yourself with people of similar goals.

 The kimono is an essential part of a geisha’s outfit. A kimono is a traditional robe cut straight and long, and fairly stiff so that it keeps its shape. Kimonos come in many styles, so pick one that fits your personal style and preferences.In general, geishas wear simple and elegant kimonos, and stay away from loud and lavishly decorated ones.
 Take the kimono put it on as you would put on a robe, slipping your hands through the sleeves.The kimono may be too long for you. If it is, pull up the right and left sides of the kimono until the bottom is grazing the floor.
Then, tie a cord around your waist over the extra fabric. This will keep the kimono elevated off the ground. The cord will be covered, so don’t worry if it doesn’t go with your kimono.
 An obi, or sash, is a wide, stiff cloth that is used as a belt for the kimono. After putting on your kimono, put on the obi, making sure to tie it in the back. Obi can be heavily patterned, so make sure to wear one that doesn’t clash with the kimono.


Geishas tie their obi in the back, as opposed to courtesans, who tie it in the front.
 For shoes, geishas wear sandals. Maiko, the apprentice geishas, wear heavy platformed sandals usually made of wood called okobo. These can be difficult to walk in, so you may prefer the flat sandals worn by geishas., Though not a strictly necessary part of the geisha outfit, you may choose to carry fans. Hand fans are used not only as cooling fans by geisha, but they also are used as props in traditional dances that are part of a geisha’s performance. Common colors used in Japanese fans are red and gold, and they often have some ornamentation like flowers or subtle geometric designs.Geishas typically use two fans in their dances.

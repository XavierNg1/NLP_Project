 Begin by using a clean, dry cloth to wipe off the leather shoes. Go over every part of the shoe. You don’t have to scrub—just try to get off any loose dirt or debris., You can use the same cloth or start with a new, clean cloth. Dampen the cloth with a small amount of water. Wipe off the shoes again with the damp cloth., Rinse off the cloth you’ve just used. Sprinkle some baking soda directly on the cloth. Firmly wipe off the shoes until they began to appear clean., Rinse off the cloth one more time. Wipe down the shoes again to remove any remaining baking soda off of the shoes. Allow the shoes to air dry for a few hours., You can find a leather conditioner online, at shoe stores, or at many supermarkets. A leather conditioner will preserve the leather and keep it looking shiny for longer. Put a little bit of conditioner on your finger, and rub it all over the leather on the outside of your shoe.Condition your shoes every 4 to 6 weeks.
Use a dry cloth to remove any excess polish.

 The shark only appears between the months of June and September. If you travel to the island, then the shark appears all year, but with the same time of day restrictions: the shark only appears between 4AM to 9AM or 4PM to 4AM.


Make sure you’ve got the right date and time; otherwise you have zero chances whatsoever of catching the shark.
If you really want a shark and it’s not the right time in the real world, you can always time-travel (manually change the date of your Animal Crossing town) to make it the right time.;
, The shark can only be fished up from the ocean. This means that you can use the ocean on the edges of your town, or the island.


Traveling to the island is accomplished by talking to Kapp’n at the docks on the southern edge of your town. For 1,000 bells he will take you to the island. Sharks appear more often on the island than they do in your town.
 The dreaded shadow that sharks make in the water is generally bigger than that of regular fish, and is most easily distinguished by the presence of a fin.


Now, the fin may indicate that you are indeed looking at a shark, but it can be a hammerhead shark or any of the other varieties. There is no guarantee that finding a finned shadow means you will catch “the shark” specifically.
 Once you’ve got your mark, equip your fishing rod, press “A” in order to use it, and cast your rod into the ocean.


The shark often requires more precision with the aim of your cast, so you may find yourself having to do it multiple times. This is because the shark will not take the bait unless it is right in front of it. Once the shark bites, press “A” to reel it in.

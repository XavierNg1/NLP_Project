 Rub non-iodized salt onto the flesh-side of the hide, roughly an inch thick, and let sit for 24 hours. Remove the old salt and repeat the process with new salt. In a cool dark place, let the hide dry. Watch carefully to make sure it doesn't get too hard to mold, however.When it's toughened up, hydrate the skin using cool water, a small capful of Lysol disinfectant, and table salt. Soak the skin in this mixture overnight and rinse several times until the salt mixture is removed. Hang skin up to drain, and towel dry when its stopped dripping. You can consider using pickling agent at this point to treat the hide farther, but make sure you take care to remove any more bits of flesh or fat that are clinging to the hide before you move on to tanning it.
Treat the hide with tanning oil. Heat up the oil a bit in the microwave and rub it into the skin with your hands. Let the skin sit for several hours and roll the skin up in a plastic bag, keeping it in the refrigerator until you're ready to mount it on the form.
 Soak the skin in a 50/50 mix of glycerin and alcohol for up to two weeks.Keep in a cool and dark place. When you remove the skin, pat it dry and remove any glycerin from the inside.
 Place the skin flesh-side down on a generous coating of borax inside a shoebox. Sprinkle about a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) more borax on top of the feathers. Leave in a cool, dark, and dry location for about 4 days. The flesh will be quite stiff after you remove from the borax. Brush off the excess and your bird or fish skin will be preserved nicely.

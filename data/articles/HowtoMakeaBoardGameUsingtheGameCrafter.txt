, Maybe your game will need a template for poker cards, game boards, or something like custom dice.
 Make sure that all of your artwork is inside the “safe zone”. There are plenty of directions on the template that will guide you, but we recommend that new designers watch the video tutorial at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqZSFpmS2dM.
, This time, click on the My Games tab. Then click on the Custom Board or Card Game image. This will create a new game project for you.
 Skip the other options for now and click on the My Games link. It will autosave your name.
 We’ll start by adding poker cards and you’ll want to click on the Decks link. Click on the “Poker Deck” icon to select that deck size.
 Hit the proof button afterwards to verify your artwork is correct.
 A new box will appear on the screen. Click on that paperclip to upload the artwork that will appear on the front of that card. Hit proof to verify that artwork is correct for the front. Repeat this process until all of your cards are created.
 You can then add a game board, parts, documents, boxes, etc. to your game as well. It’s basically like building a recipe and you can make changes whenever you’d like.
 You just made your own game!

, Your new game will arrive within 7-10 days! Have fun!

 If your picture frame or mirror has a wire-hanger in the back, be sure to take into account the amount of slack when figuring-out where you want the picture or mirror to hang.
 If the picture frame or mirror has multiple hooks on the back, be sure to measure the distance between them. Make another small pencil mark where the second-anchor will be installed (in-line with the previous mark, spaced the same distance as the hooks on the picture farm or mirror).
 The hole should be slightly larger than the molly bolt. You can measure it by folding the wings and measuring its width. As the molly bolt is screwed in its wings will compress and create tension, filling any gap.Be sure that you hold the drill perpendicular to the wall so that the anchor is installed perfectly straight. All wall anchors should be installed parallel to the ground.


Make sure you hole you drill is deeper than the anchor is long.
 Unlike the other two types of anchors, which require the anchor and the support screw to be installed separately, the molly bolt and screw are installed at the same time. Prepare the molly bolt by screwing the support screw into the winged-bolt.
 Be sure to hold the screwdriver perpendicular to the wall as you are turning it clockwise. This will help ensure that the anchor is installed perfectly straight.









Since the hole you drilled earlier is larger than the molly bolt, you should not have to use a drill.Don't over tighten, the molly bolt will flare as you screw it into the wall.Just make sure that it is snug.

 Whisk the ingredients in a medium saucepan and heat it over medium heat. Stir constantly so that the sugar doesn’t burn and crystallize.You can use evaporated milk instead of cream.
 As soon as it boils, set the timer for 2.5 minutes. Continue stirring the mixture the entire time it’s boiling. Remove it from the heat as soon as the timer is up.


Boiling the mixture for 2.5 minutes allows the sugars to begin caramelizing.
 Beat the mixture on high speed with electric beaters for six to eight minutes, until it becomes smooth, light, fluffy, and the perfect consistency to spread onto cakes or other desserts.


The purpose of the baking soda is to prevent the sugar from hardening.
You can also beat the mixture in a stand mixture. Once the sugar mixture boils, add the baking soda and vanilla and transfer it to the stand mixer bowl.

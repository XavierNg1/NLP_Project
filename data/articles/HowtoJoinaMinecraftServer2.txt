 Just like with the desktop version of the game, you'll need the IP address of the server you want to connect to if you're playing on mobile. You can find these on similar IP address list sites that contain information on a huge number of game servers for Minecraft PE. Below are just a few trustworthy sites you may want to try:


minecraftpocket-servers.com/mcpestats.com/, When you find a server that looks like it will be hosting the type of game you want to play, copy down the IP address. You will need it to connect to the game.


Since you're not on a computer, you may not be able to copy and paste it from your clipboard (though many smartphones have this feature.) If all else fails, just write it down on a slip of paper.
 Launch the game on your mobile device. On the first screen, click "Play." This will take you to a screen that displays your current list of servers.
 Click "Edit" in the top right of the screen. Then, click the "External" button that appears next to it. This will take you to a screen where you can input information for the server you want to join.
 In the box labeled "address", type in (or paste) the IP address for the server you want to join. Give the server a name (for instance, you might want to choose one that describes the game mode: "Survival," etc.). When you're finished, click "Add Server."


Leave the "Port" settings alone unless the information for the server you want to join specifically asks you to change them.
 Return to the previous page. You should see the server you just added in the list of the available servers. Click on it to load the game world!

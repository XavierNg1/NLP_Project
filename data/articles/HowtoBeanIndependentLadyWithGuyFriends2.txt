 There are plenty of women out there who are great to talk to and spend time with. Be open to the idea of friends of all genders, in case someone who comes along who is a lot of fun.
 Bonding through common interests is a great way to make new friends, including guys. You can talk about the activity and get to know each other better.


Clubs, volunteer opportunities, and mixed-gender sports groups are all places where you can meet new friends.
 Not everyone is looking for new friends, and not everyone will be a good match with you. If a guy seems less than enthusiastic to see you, don't force it. There are lots of guys out there, who will appreciate you more, and be in a better place for friendship.


Acting aggressive (shouting, hitting, swearing a lot) won't necessarily make guys want to be around you.
 Giving lots of compliments, touching them often, smiling and biting your lip suggestively, et cetera, can be read as flirting. Make sure that your actions portray how you really feel, so that there isn't confusion.
 People love to talk about their interests, so ask questions and get involved with things they like. Look for interests that the two of you have in common, and bring up conversation topics related to them.
 Be a good listener if they want to talk, and distract them with an interesting conversation topic or activity if they want to get their minds off things. If a guy friend seems particularly stressed, try doing some type of exercise together, because this may help him let off steam.
 A good friend is someone who brings out the best in you, makes you feel comfortable, and turns an okay day into a good one.

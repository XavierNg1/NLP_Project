 Be sure to include the sales tax in the total. Invoices should be generated as soon as you ship the ordered product or finish providing a service.
 Find out what the usual percentage is in your industry by asking others in a professional association. For example, you could offer 2 percent off if paid in 10 days instead of 30 days.


The discount should be noted on the invoice as 2/10 net 30.
 The discount should never apply to the sales tax. Whether or not shipping and handling are included with the product price is also to be considered when determining the total invoice amount. For example, if the total invoice is $500, multiply $500 by 2 percent or .02 to get $10. This is the amount of revenue you will be losing by offering the discount.
 For example, $500 - $10 = $490. This is the net amount owed with the discount.

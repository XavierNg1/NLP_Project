 Beans are high in soluble fiber, which binds to cholesterol and prevents it from entering your circulation. Research studies have indicated that adding half a cup of cooked beans to your salad (when eaten once daily for two months) can substantially reduce your high cholesterol.When adding beans to your salad, plan to start with common varieties including black and pinto beans. These should all be in stock at your local grocery store. Once you’re familiar with these types of beans, you can branch out into less common types of bean including garbanzo and navy beans.


Other legumes will have the same beneficial effect of lowering bad cholesterol: try adding a handful of sprouts, a dollop of hummus, or a serving of falafel to your next salad.;
, Topping your salad with a moderately sized handful of nuts, such as almonds, pecans, or walnuts, can decrease your LDL (bad) cholesterol by 10%. If you’re not in the mood for nuts on your salad, consider substituting a handful of healthy seeds, such as sesame, sunflower, or flax seeds.In addition to providing healthy, unsaturated fats and delicious flavors, nuts are also a substitute for high-cholesterol croutons. Croutons, as with many other breads and grain products, are high in bad cholesterols.
 Unlike other types of fatty, unhealthy meat, salmon is actually quite healthy when added to a salad. Salmon is a fatty food, but its fats are good for your health: the fish is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which boost your heart health and can help lower LDL cholesterol.Salmon is a rich fish with plenty of flavor, so you won’t need to put a large amount on a salad in order to taste the fish.


Like most fish, salmon can be pulled apart into neat “flakes” once it’s been cooked. Cook your salmon—say, a quarter pound—and then flake off as much as you please on top of your salad.

 Look at their footwork and the way they throw the ball.;
, Whenever you have a chance to throw the ball around do it! It can be as simple as playing catch with a friend but remember to use the right mechanics.
 Lift weights or just do a light jog. I recommend 150 pushups and 100 sit ups a day. These both build strength and give your core a workout. Remember also to always stretch.
 Don't be like Joba Chamberlain who was a great prospect and always worked hard until he got to the pros. He thought "Hey I'm in the pros! I don't need to work hard anymore, I'm playing for the Yankees!" Well now he's about to get cut.
 Whenever you are doing anything that causes a strain on your muscles, always drink Gatorade or water.
 Before you go to bed every night, just practice going through the motions.
 Think of yourself pitching a perfect game or a no-hitter. Or just think about throwing strikes.
 Go to an organization like the Strike Zone or the UBA. They have instructors that will teach you how to throw correctly.

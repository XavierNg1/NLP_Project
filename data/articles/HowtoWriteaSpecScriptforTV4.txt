 Given the volume of submissions, most television shows only accept spec scripts through professional colleagues - i.e. agents. Agents serve as a filter, vouching for quality candidates and weeding out applicants that have no chance of being valuable. Visit the Writer's Guild of America's website at https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-write-a-spec-script-1283509 for a list of reputable, signatory agents., Most television shows hire new writers only once a year, during staffing season. For network television shows, this period lasts roughly from April-June. Cable shows don't necessarily follow the same schedule, but also hire writers once a year.The rising trend of internet-based television shows (e.g. Netflix original series) may mean more flexibility and variety in terms of hiring periods.
 The television industry can be very insular in terms of hiring; showrunners tend to hire friends or promote writing assistants or other trusted, low-level employees to writing jobs before hiring outside talent. Get into the industry by means of any job you can find in it (for example, an administrative assistant at an agency) and work on creating and building relationships while in that position. Do your best to charm agents, executives, producers, and other writers, and approach them with your spec script once you have won their favor.

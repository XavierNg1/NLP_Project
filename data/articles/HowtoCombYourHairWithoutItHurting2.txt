 Rather than trying to run a comb through your entire head of hair at once, it’s best to work with one, tiny section at a time. With your free hand, separate the section that you’ll be working with first.
 With brisk, light strokes, brush the end of your hair until you’ve worked the tangles out of that part of the section. Do not start moving upwards until you’re confident that you’ve worked out all the knots below., As you comb out each section, move up your hair, towards the root. Little by little, you will comb out the entire section you’re holding in your free hand. Remember, take your time. If you attempt to comb our larger sections, you will run into bigger (and more painful) knots.
 Repeat steps 1 to 3, gently working your way up each section. Continue these steps until you've finished combing through every section of hair. This process may take awhile, but combing your hair out gently section by section will greatly reduce any pain to your scalp.

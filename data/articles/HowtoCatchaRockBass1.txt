 This usually means getting a rod, reel, and some fishing line to spool on.


In addition to this, you'll need a lure. Most pan-fishermen prefer using a small 1/16 oz. jig, that is tipped with a red worm, wax worm, or piece of nightcrawler. Most rock bass will take nightcrawler, but it is also good to try spinners and spoons;
, You can Google local fishing conditions, or you may be able to find a fishing report on the web page of your state's Natural Resources or Fish & Game department.


Look for lakes, ponds, or rivers close to where you live.
 You can be fined and ticketed for fishing without a permit. It is very important that you have one, and that fishing is legal in your area.
 There usually is the same amount of action on shore that there is in a boat. If you want to go on a wider search for these fish, a boat is always recommended.
 The lake may offer safety gear (life vests, flotation devices, etc.) for a small fee. By law, those safety features are required if in a boat.
 This means rent the boat for a period of time, buy the bait, or buy "dock-space".
 Spool the line onto the reel, string the rod, tie your hook, and put the bait on the hook.

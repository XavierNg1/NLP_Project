 If you've just gotten back from a family reunion and your child doesn't want to go to school the next day, try to accommodate her. Let her stay home to recharge. If you can't, ask her teacher to give her some slack that day.
 Don't ignore the good things they do. Show that you care as much about the good as the bad. Put their interest to good use here: if they ace a difficult exam, praise them, and maybe make their favorite meal.
 Assume that your child is competent and wants to behave well. Treat them with dignity and take time to listen to them.
 Yes, your child needs to know what not to do, but they also need to know what to do instead. Teach them good ways to handle strong emotions, bullying, conflicts, and other difficult situations.
 Your child learns how to manage their emotions by watching you. When you're angry or stressed, behave the way you'd like them to behave.


It's okay to say "I need a break," take deep breaths, or say that you're too overwhelmed to handle this right now.

 If you're absolutely desperate to get likes fast, there's a market on the internet to meet your need. Try doing a search engine query for "buy Instagram likes" or similar terms — it shouldn't be hard to find relevant results. There are a variety of services that offer instant likes for a fee. Many offer different packages that you can choose from, depending on how many likes you want.


Note that, typically, in order for this set-up to work, you’ll need to make sure that your Instagram account is not private.
In general, buying likes in bulk gets you the best value per like, just like buying goods in the real world.
 It's also possible to buy large numbers of followers at once to instantly boost your Instagram visibility. Typically, the followers you buy will be "bots" (profiles created and run automatically by computer programs), but depending on the service you use, these "fake" followers may still be able to like your posts.
 It should go without saying that paying for likes or followers is usually seen as a shallow, borderline-unethical thing to do by most Instagram users. It's sometimes described as "cheating" one's way to visibility by using one's wealth (and not one's creativity) to achieve popularity. In addition, it can sometimes be a professional liability — some companies may be hesitant to endorse or partner with Instagrammers who became popular by paying for it.Be aware that it's not always hard for followers to figure out that you are buying likes or followers, especially if you buy a lot. If you're looking for it, it's easy to notice a sudden enormous upsurge in someone’s likes. If you're caught in the act, you may lose the favor of some of your "real" fans.

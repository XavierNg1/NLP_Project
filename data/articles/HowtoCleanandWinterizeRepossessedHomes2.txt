 This includes electricity, gas and water.


Unplug all appliances and turn off electrical breakers.
 Once the water is shut off, there will still be water left in the pipes. If that water is left in there, it can freeze and damage the home's plumbing.

Turn on every faucet and water fixture once the main water is turned off to drain. Flush toilets until they will not flush again.






Hook up an air compressor to a ice maker supply line to blow out any remaining water in the pipes.
Remember to turn faucets back off after you drain the water. Otherwise, the house could flood once the water is turned back on.
 Any kind of insulation will work to keep the pipes warm enough to avoid cracking or bursting.



Look for antifreeze made for recreational vehicles (RVs). It should be pink in color.



Shovel or plow any driveways or walkways, and make sure heavy snow does not accumulate on the roof or it could cause leaking or caving.
 This will dissuade visitors or realtors from trying to use the sinks or toilets.

As a midfielder, your pass needs to be accurate and able to be handled by the receiver.,,, While using the infoot greatly compromises power, it more than compensates with great accuracy.

In case you need to send it out far, position yourself a bit farther from the ball, and make the contact when it is about 10 cm (4") off the ground.

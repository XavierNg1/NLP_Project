 Fill a medium sized skillet with your cooking oil. Use a medium heat to heat the oil. Insert your tortillas into the skillet. Allow these to fry in the oil for about one minute per side. Turn the tortillas with tongs, a fork, or a similar utensil. Place the tortillas on paper towel when they are done to soak up excess oil. Add salt to the tortillas to taste.

These home fried tortillas will be fresh, but you could also use tortilla chips in place of these fried pieces of tortilla., If you've just cooked the lobster, it's likely still hot and this step can be skipped. If not, place a sauté pan on the stovetop and set the burner to a low heat. Coat the bottom of the pan with the lemon oil. Add the lobster meat to the pan and cook it until the meat is warm. This usually takes about 5 minutes.

When the lobster is heated, remove it from the heat and set it aside for later. You may want to cover your lobster so it stays hot., In a large mixing bowl, use a wooden spoon or a similar kitchen implement to thoroughly mix together the corn, tomatoes, chopped mint and cilantro, jalapeno, black beans, jicama, lime juice, chili powder, and garlic salt. Continue to mix these ingredients until they are consistently distributed.

If you’re sensitive to spicy things, remove the jalapeno and chili powder from these ingredients. For milder nachos, halve the amount used for these ingredients., Spread a thick layer of tortilla chips onto four serving plates. Evenly distribute the bean salsa you prepared in the mixing bowl on top of the chips. On each plate, arrange a ½ cup (118 ml) of lobster meat on top of the bean salsa. Add the rest of your ingredients as garnishes and enjoy.

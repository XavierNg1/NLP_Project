 The key to effective breathing for singing is in the breath. The most important aspect of breathing is breathing with your diaphragm, the muscles underneath your lungs that help them to move air in and out. A great way to visualize breathing with your diaphragm is to picture a rubber ring around your waist. This ring will move in and out, getting bigger and smaller, with each inhale and exhale., As you inhale through your nose, visualize the ring around your waist getting bigger and expanding horizontally. Your stomach should protrude as you inhale this way., As you exhale, attempt to make the ring contract and become smaller. This visualization should help you to breathe with your diaphragm, thus improving your singing. Breathing through your nose ensures better breath control and helps you to breathe in more slowly, allowing you to focus on how you are breathing, rather than how much air you are sucking in., It is common to hunch your shoulders as you breathe. Sometimes tension creeps up on us. Another important aspect of singing is to relax our muscles. This will allow them to move properly. If you feel tension in your shoulders, remind yourself to relax. Visualize your neck getting longer and the tension melting away from your shoulders and into the ground. It can also help to take a few long, deep, slow breaths to relax and stabilize your mind and body.

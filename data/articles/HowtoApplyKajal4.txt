 Close your eye and relax the muscles in your eyelid. You need to expose as much of the eyelid as possible since this style will be blended over the entire lid.


If necessary, you can keep your eye open in a small slit to help you see better and improve your accuracy.
It may help to tilt your head forward since doing so exposes more of the closed eyelid and may allow you to see it more clearly.
 Swipe a thick line of kajal directly over the upper lash line of the eye, moving from the inner corner to the outer corner.









Try to keep the line evenly thick, but don't worry about making it perfectly even or smooth. Most imperfections created during this step will be hidden later.
Create a line of kajal 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3 to 6 mm) thick. You may need to pass over the upper lash line multiple times to make the line adequately thick.
 Take a fluffy eye shadow brush and smudge the kajal upward, working it through the crease and toward the brow bone.








Work in vertical strokes that are perpendicular to the lash line. You'll need to work across the initial line of kajal in short increments, continuing until the entire line has been blended upward.
Note that the kajal should naturally lighten as you brush it upward, creating the desired gradient effect.
 To further accent the gradient, draw another thin line of kajal over the upper lash line, working from the inner corner to the outer edge.









You do not need to blend this line or thicken it. The purpose is merely to darken the starting edge of the gradient.
Once you finish drawing in this final line of kajal, the look is complete.

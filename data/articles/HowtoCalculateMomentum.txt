  In the formula, p{\displaystyle p} stands for the momentum, m{\displaystyle m} stands for the mass, and v{\displaystyle v} stands for the velocity.
 Mass is the amount of matter in an object.  To measure the mass of an object, you can use a balance.  In physics, there is a rule: you have to measure things in SI units which all the scientists in the world use.  The SI unit for mass is kilogram or kg.
 Velocity is the speed and the direction that the object travels. Right now, we will only concentrate on the speed part. You can calculate the velocity of an object by dividing the distance that the object traveled by the time it took to travel the distance.  Again, you have to measure velocity in SI unit.  The SI unit for velocity is m/s (meters per second).
, That is the momentum!  The measurement for momentum is kg*m/s.

For example, when the mass of an object is 4kg{\displaystyle 4kg} and its velocity is 2.5ms{\displaystyle 2.5{\frac {m}{s}}}, then its momentum is equal to 4kg⋅2.5ms=10kg⋅ms{\displaystyle 4kg\cdot 2.5{\frac {m}{s}}=10{\frac {kg\cdot m}{s}}}.

 There are many Drupal theme sites which offer free themes (and sometimes paid-for premium themes) to choose from:


Drupal.org Themes
Theme Garden
All Drupal Themes.com
and others: just search for "Drupal themes";
, Near the bottom of most theme pages is a table with several rows and at least 4 columns. This is the downloads table, and has the columns: Version, Download, Date,and Links. Find the row where the version number matches the version of your Drupal installation (for example, 7.x is for any version of Drupal 7) and has a green background (which means it's safe to use), right-click one of the two links and copy the link - it doesn't matter which of the two types you choose.
 Log into your Drupal installation and go to the Appearance page.
 Click or tap on the link Install new theme. Right-click on the Install from a URL text box and paste your copied link into it. Press the Install button.
 Go to the Themes page in Drupal, and find your new theme in the Disabled Themes section. Click or tap on the Enable and set default link (in Drupal 7), or select the enabled check box if there is one, and then select the default radio button to make this theme your site's default theme. Disable all other enabled themes to require users to use the new theme.
 Most Drupal themes allow further customisation, and a configure link will show up next to your current default theme; click or tap on it.

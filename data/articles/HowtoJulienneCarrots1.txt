 A whole carrot is usually too cumbersome to julienne, so it helps to cut your carrots into smaller pieces. Use a sharp chef’s knife to slice the carrot in half horizontally.If a carrot is particularly long, you may want to cut it into three or four pieces. You’ll have the easiest time julienning pieces that are approximately 3- to 4-inches (8 to 10 cm) long or smaller.
It’s important to work on a cutting board so you don’t damage your countertop or other surface while you’re julienning the carrots.;
, Take your carrot halves, and use your knife to cut them each down the middle lengthwise. Be careful to curl your fingertips out of the way because the round shape of the carrot means it may move as you’re cutting.If your carrot keeps moving as your trying to cut, you may want to slice a small piece off on one side to create a flat surface to steady it.
The safest positioning when holding a carrot for cutting consists of your fingertips bent at the top knuckle, so that your fingernails are vertical to the carrot. You can also apply slight pressure with your fingernails as a means of holding the carrot steady from this position

, Place the carrot pieces with the cut side facing down to steady them. Slice each piece into four equal pieces with your knife.The pieces that you cut should be rectangular in shape.
 Take each of the four carrot pieces, and use your knife to cut them into thirds. If you want even thinner pieces, you can cut them into more pieces until the carrot sticks are as thin as you want.The finished julienned carrot pieces should resemble matchsticks.

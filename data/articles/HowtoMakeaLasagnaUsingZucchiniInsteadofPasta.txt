 While the oven is heating, lightly spray a 9x13 inch (22cm x 28cm) baking pan with non stick olive oil cooking spray.;
, Be careful as the knife can slip on the shiny surface of the zucchini; work on a solid, unmoving surface. Sprinkle each side with salt and freshly ground pepper. Place seasoned slices on a clean plate.
 Coat evenly with olive oil and allow oil to heat for one to two minutes.
 Cook each side of the zucchini thoroughly until browned and then turn over and roast the other side. Transfer pieces back to the clean plate once both sides have been roasted.
 Coat a large saucepan with olive oil and add the diced garlic, green pepper and onion. Place on the stove top at medium-high heat.


Add two cans of whole peeled tomatoes and allow the garlic, green pepper, onion, olive oil and tomatoes to simmer at medium-high heat for approximately five minutes.
Add oregano and basil and a dash of salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, cover sauce and simmer for an hour.
, Transfer the sauce to a blender and blend on high until smooth and velvety.



Spread half of the sauce across the bottom of the pre-greased pan. Add one layer of roasted zucchini (using approximately half of the slices), cover well with the ricotta cheese mixture (about half the mixture), followed by 4 ounces (113g) of mozzarella cheese.
Repeat the above step beginning with zucchini, ricotta cheese mixture and top with mozzarella cheese.
Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese over the top. Cover with aluminum foil.
 To avoid having the sauce and cheese spill over onto the oven, bake on a cookie sheet.
 Increase the oven temperature to 350ºF/180ºC and continue baking for 15 minutes.
 Serve with a fresh salad of your choice.

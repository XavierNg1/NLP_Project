 Begin to focus on the object by adjusting the coarse focus knob. This will be the larger of the two knobs on the side of the microscope. Rotate the knob clockwise and counterclockwise until you see the best possible picture through the eyepiece.Adjusting the coarse focus knob may not give you optimum clarity. The coarse focus knob is meant to bring the object mostly into focus so that the fine focus knob can be effective.
 After you have adjusted the coarse focus knob, you can fine tune your focus by adjusting the fine focus knob. This will be the smaller of the two knobs on the side of the microscope. Just as you did with the coarse focus knob, turn this knob clockwise and counterclockwise until you see the best picture in the eyepiece., You can adjust the stage up and down as well as left and right. Adjusting the stage up and down will bring the object closer or further away. Adjust it left to right if the object that you are viewing is not centered under the objective.When adjusting the stage, be sure not to allow the objective lens to touch the slide.

 Stand upright, with your feet slightly wider than your hips. For this exercise to work your abs, you'll need a weight or medicine ball. Hold it in your hands and reach it above your head.One variation to the position is to start with your feet together. If you do this, you’ll swing one leg out as you reach down.To get an image of what this exercise will look like, imagine you are splitting wood with a heavy axe.
 Bring the weight toward your right knee.This should be an explosive movement — imagine the weight is your axe and you're striking wood that is positioned in front of your right knee.


This movement will force you to twist your torso. Keep your abs tight as you rotate.Pivot the left foot and bend your knees slightly as you twist.Do not use the momentum from your arms to twist — this should be a controlled movement.Make sure your back stays straight and your arms are fully extended as you swing downwards.
If you started with your feet together, step out with your right foot., Resuming the starting position will work your back, glutes, and hamstrings — it's the downward motion that really blasts your abs.
 Do the same movement to the other side, bringing the weight or medicine ball down toward your left knee.


If you prefer, you can repeat several times to one side, about 20, before switching to the other side. Just remember to do a consistent number of reps between each side.

 To get the area of an ellipse, you'll need to know the two "radio", which you can think of as the width and the height each divided in half. These are the measurements from the center to the middle of the long side and from the center to the middle of the short side. The measurement lines should form a right angle.


In the real world, you'll have to measure for yourself but for your homework your teacher should have these measurements listed with the shape.
 For us, let's say that the ellipse is 6 inches wide and 4 inches tall. This gives us radii of 3 inches and 2 inches. Now, we'll multiply those numbers by each other, giving us 6 (3x2).
 Pi (Ï€) is a really big number that is used in lots of calculations. If you're using a calculator, use the pi function for a really accurate result. If not, you can round pi (ignore some of the numbers) and just multiply by 3.14159. That gives us a value of 18.84954.
 That resulting number is the area of your ellipse. For us, that means our ellipse is 18.84954 square inches.

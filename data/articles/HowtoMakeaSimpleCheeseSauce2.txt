 This recipe calls for sodium citrate, which is a type of salt that works as an emulsifier. This means that when it is added to cheese sauce, it reduces the cheese’s acidity, makes the proteins in the cheese more soluble, and prevents it from separating. Instead, it helps to create a smooth, creamy texture to your cheese sauce.Look in speciality food stores and online for sodium citrate. It looks like salt and tastes salty and slightly sour. You will only need a very small amount of sodium citrate in the sauce for it to do it’s job, so it is not upping the sodium level of your cheese sauce.
If you can't find sodium citrate, you can use 2 teaspoons of citric acid (or sour salt) and 2.5 teaspoons of baking sodium as a substitute. Citric acid, or sour salt, can be found in the kosher section of most grocery stores.
You should also use high-quality cheese for your fancy cheese sauce, such as Pepper Jack, Gouda, or Gruyère. These cheeses will likely come in blocks. Use a grater to make 1 cup of your chosen fancy cheese.
 In a medium saucepan, mix together the sodium citrate and the water, beer, or wine.There should be enough liquid mixture to just cover the bottom of your saucepan; the entire ½ cup may not be necessary so pour the liquid in a little bit at a time.
 Place the medium saucepan on a medium heat and bring the liquid to a low simmer, but not a full boil. There should be small bubbles forming on the surface of the liquid.
 Add the cheese to the pan and stir with a spoon until the cheese has melted and is blended with the liquid. Thanks to the sodium citrate, the sauce should have a smooth, creamy consistency., Put your sauce in a bowl and dip chips or vegetables into it, or pour it over chips to make nachos. You can even pour it on top of steamed vegetables to make them more delicious.


The sauce should maintain its creamy texture, even as it begins to cool.
This sauce can be stored for up to a week in the refrigerator.

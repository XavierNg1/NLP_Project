 It's a little difficult to contact them otherwise.;
, Anything to have a conversation with him/her will make a small friendship grow.Remember: Don't call them all the time. They will think you are obsessed and feel pressured.
 If you have classes together, it's a good idea to ask for the homework, or talk about the teachers, and whatnot.
 Don't come right at it and say "What's your phone number?" Let it pop up in the conversation. Sometimes, a good way of doing this is by saying you got a text message, then asking "Oh, I don't think I have your number. Could you give it to me?"

, If they ask why, just say "Oh, just wondering." Don't say anything you could regret. That will ruin your friendship, crush your hopes and spirits, and cancel out any chances you had with them.

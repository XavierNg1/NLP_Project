The Left Bank is the area south of the Seine river. It includes the student-oriented Latin Quarter and the St. German-Des-Pres neighborhood, one of Paris's cafe centers. The Right Bank is the more historic part of the city, with the expensive shopping areas of the Grands Boulevards and the Champs-Elysees, as well as the more bohemian neighborhood of Montmartre.;
, Prices for the former tend to be more expensive.


On the Left Bank, the Cafe de Flore and the Cafe Les Deux Magots in St. Germain-des-Pres are typical examples of the traditional Paris cafe, with lots of tourists and high prices. Cafe de la Paix, by the Opera on the Right Bank, is another classic cafe.
Le Sancerre near Montmartre is a good choice for a more laid-back atmosphere. Aux Folies in the neighborhood of Belleville is another reasonable choice, with more eclectic fare that tends away from traditional French restaurant cuisine.
 Sometimes it's best to find a cafe purely based on what it looks like from the outside, and not on reputation.

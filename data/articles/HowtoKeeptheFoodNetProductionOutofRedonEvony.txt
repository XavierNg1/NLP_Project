 If it is decreasing, then you know that the production is going short. Or if you see numbers that are red beside the number of food you have in the city, then you know it's going down.
 This is very important. Farms are the main source of food in Evony and if you don't have enough, you are going to be in big trouble in the future. If you do not have enough slots to build farms, then destroy some other resource fields. Like Quarry's, stone is useless in the game. You could buy them at a decent price.
 If you have such a big army, then they will need a lot of food. Resulting the loss of food. You can shorten your army and you will see productions raise depending on how much you release. But do not shorten all of your army, someone may be attacking you and you have no defense for it.
 Researching this helps increase the production by 10% every time you research it. Build more cities to research more things.
 Food is at a very decent price. Like in na47, if you buy 1,000,000 food, it is priced at 496,000 gold. Sell some of your lumber/iron to earn some gold. You can earn a lot of it if you keep selling them.;
, Some people in your alliance might have some food to spare. You can ask them through alliance chat and see if they can spare. You must give them your coordinates so they know where to send it.


Numerous people can send food to you.

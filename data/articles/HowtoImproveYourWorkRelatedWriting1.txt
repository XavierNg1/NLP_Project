 Usually, unless an immediate reply to an e-mail is required, you have time to think about what you're writing and how best to say it. Take that time to determine what you have to say and the right order to say it in.;
, If you're replying to a written request, you can glean the requirements of what to write from the questions in that request; if not, you can ask the requester to clarify what he or she is asking for before you reply. For longer pieces, such as a policy manual or business report, you can look at examples of prior documents to figure out what should and shouldn't be included and how to phrase it.


If your department has a style guide for the types of work-related writing it does, consult it as frequently as necessary during the planning and writing process.
 Writing for corporate executives is different from writing for customers, and both are different from writing for your immediate boss or your co-workers. While you need to establish a professional tone at all times, each audience is looking for different information and each audience brings a different range of knowledge and expectations to what they're reading.


Try to steer a middle course between being overly stiff and too casual in how you write. You can be more casual with customers and co-workers if the content of your message permits it, but you should be more formal when writing for corporate executives and shareholders.

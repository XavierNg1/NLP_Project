 On a phone or tablet, open the Facebook app—it’s the blue icon with a white “F.” If you’re on a computer (or don’t have the app), visit https://www.facebook.com in a web browser.


If you’re not already signed into Facebook, enter your login information and click Log In.
Use this method to see Pages on which your friend has clicked "Like." Pages are Facebook accounts set up for companies, products, celebrities, services, bands—basically any Facebook page that isn’t a typical person’s profile.
 You can find it by typing their name into the search box at the top of the screen and selecting it from the search results.
 It’s beneath your friend’s profile photo in the app, and below the cover photo in your browser.
 You may have to scroll down pretty far if your friend’s profile contains a lot of information. Now you’ll see the entire list of Pages your friend likes.


If you don’t see a Likes section, your friend either has not liked any Pages or has made this section private.

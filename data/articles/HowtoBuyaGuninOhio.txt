If a background check is required, it will be performed with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) database to determine whether or not you meet the lawful criteria.
 In the state of Ohio, a mandatory waiting period does not exist that requires you to come back at a later date to retrieve your gun from the dealership.

 There are lots of topics covered in "Backyard Games" here on wikiHow, plus the usual team sports like basketball, baseball, and soccer. Get involved in these, or be creative.;
, This may be your own backyard, if you are fortunate enough to have a large one, a local public park, or a church or school grounds if they permit off hours use of their property.
 They may help you to discover lost games like shooting marbles, mumblety peg, jacks, or even plain old tag. If no one has time to relate the rules and strategies for any of these games or others, search them here at wikiHow, or google them.
 With a very small space, games like kickball, croquet, and badminton may be out, but if you have room for these, the cost of setting up the basic games is not too expensive, and they can give you a good dose of competition as well as some good exercise.
, There may be basketball and tennis courts available for public use, and often it is just a matter of bringing your ball or racquet and hanging around a while for a challenger to show up alone to get a game started.
 Many of these are free access, and the rules are posted at the course entrance. There are all types of golf discs to choose from, but one disc is all that is really required to play the game.
 If you don't have clubs and equipment, they can usually be rented, and many communities have "par three" courses with low green fees and no need for a cart. Design a golf course in your backyard, or maybe you can find an unused soccer field and pick up a bucket of range balls and practice driving and chipping without paying any green fees at all. Be polite, though, and don't divot up the grass.
, Drink lots of cool water, and take frequent breaks.
 This doesn't give you a lot of exercise, but at least you can get some sun and fresh air, and stay out of your parents' hair for a while. And, while you are sitting outside playing your game, someone may come by and invite you to play other games with them.

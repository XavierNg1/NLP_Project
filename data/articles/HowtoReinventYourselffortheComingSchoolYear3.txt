 Building Self-Confidence is a difficult but important part of reinventing yourself, and it requires a commitment to positive thinking. Be conscious of your reaction to things and make an effort to adjust your thinking in key moments. For example: stop yourself from making negative generalizations (such as, “I always screw things up.”)
avoid jumping to negative conclusions (e.g. “No one at the party will like me.”)
view setbacks as temporary (e.g. “I didn’t do well in school today, but tomorrow will be better” instead of “I’m doing horribly in school.”)

, An important part of reinvention and self-improvement is removing yourself from anyone who make you feel bad or insecure. Your social circle should be a source of happiness and support for you, as friends influence our lives, thoughts, and actions tremendously. To remove toxic friends, be upfront, honest, and unapologetic about your feelings, and state your intention to remove yourself from negative energy; real friends will recognize their fault and be understanding about it.Approach a bad friend by saying something like, “Your negative comments are affecting me and I deserve better from a friend. If you can’t be a positive influence in my life, I will have to keep my distance from you.”

, True reinvention means leaving behind bad habits and moving forward. Make a point of being conscious about your vices, flaws, and patterns and dealing with them in a proactive way. Whenever you feel yourself slipping into old habits, gain momentum by doing something, however small, to get yourself out of the spiral.E.g. If you feel yourself procrastinating or avoiding something you have to do, make an outline of the steps you will have to do to complete your task. Planning it is one small step towards getting things done.

 Was it the pay? The prestige? The chance to develop a long term career? It's worth remembering- there was a reason you decided to take up this job.;
, If you're unemployed, you're going to have an increased income. If you're employed currently, you're going to have a change of environment and meet new people.
 Is there a chance for career progression? Is the job more suited to your personality and thus you will enjoy your working life more?

, We all have bad days at work. Don't let them rule your life. Talk about it with friends or family. Let off some steam. Many employees let things build and build and walk out of jobs that they otherwise enjoy.
 If you're on JSA and leave a job for no good reason you won't get any benefit for 26 weeks. If you have worked previously and have some money behind you, it will run out pretty quickly. You face an unknown amount of time stuck at home with limited finances competing with employed people for jobs that are few and far between.
 Weigh up all the pros and cons. Only you can decide if the alternative is better. For example, if your job is making you seriously ill with stress, the alternative of being unemployed might be better for a while. You're an adult, only you can decide your working future.

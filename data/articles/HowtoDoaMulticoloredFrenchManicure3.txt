 You will need to choose a color for the base and at least two colors for the tips. If you only want the tips to be colored, use a clear or nude polish for the base. For the tips, consider using two colors. Use one color for the middle of the tip, and one colors for the edges of each tip.Some options to consider are shades of the same color for the tip, white and gold, and a sparkly and matte color.
 Go over each nail with a layer of the base nail polish. Make sure each nail is fully coated. Wait a few minutes and add a second layer if you aren’t satisfied with the first layer. After that, wait at least ten minutes before moving on to the tips., Take the first color and paint a strip down the center of your tip. Only paint as far down as the tip of your nail. The end of the tip should be around your cuticles. Next, take the second color and paint a strip on each side of the center color. When you’re done, you should have three strips of color with at least two different colors.You can also choose to use three different colors for the tips. Or you can make some nails have different colors than other nails.
 Once you have give your nails time to dry, apply a layer of clear nail polish. This will protect your polish and add shine. Give it at least ten minutes before you begin moving around and using your hands.

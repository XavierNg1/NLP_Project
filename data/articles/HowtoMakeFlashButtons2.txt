 1 of the most common tasks that a button is created for is to jump to another frame in a Flash movie. For example, you can create a Stop button that will stop the movie and jump to the first frame or create chapter buttons to jump to the first frame of different chapters in your movie. You can create a button that jumps to another frame using the following method.


Open the movie you want to add the button to in Adobe Flash.
Access your Flash Library by clicking on "Window" in the top menu and selecting "Library."
Drag the button from your Flash Library and drop it on the location where you want it to appear in your movie.
Right-click on the button and select "Properties" from the pop-up menu.
Go to the "Actions" tab and click on the plus sign that appears.
Choose the option "On MouseEvent" from the submenu.
Select "Release" to tell Flash that the action needs to performed when the mouse-click is released on the button.
Click on the plus sign in the Actions tab again and this time select the "Go To" option.
Enter the frame number that you want to jump to when the button is clicked.
Scroll to the bottom of the window and select "Go to and Stop" if you want the movie to stop when it jumps to the other frame. Select "Go to and Play" if you want the movie to continue playing after it jumps to the other frame.

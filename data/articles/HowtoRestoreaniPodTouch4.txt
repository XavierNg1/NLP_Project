 If you want to reload new data on to your iPod touch instead of erasing all of your data, you can do so by syncing your device to your iTunes account.
 Again, make sure to do so before connecting your iPod touch.
, The iPod management screen should appear in your iTunes. A screen will pop up saying that an iPod has previously been synced with your computer. It will ask you to either set up your iPod as a new device or restore from a backup.
 Your iPod will automatically restore and restart. Leave the iPod plugged in to your computer the entire time.
 If you are missing apps, click on the "Apps" tab at the top of your iTunes iPod management screen and check the "Sync" box in the upper right-hand corner.

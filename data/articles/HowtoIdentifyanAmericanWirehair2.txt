 American Wirehairs are skilled hunters who enjoy chasing small birds or mice. They may even bring you a “gift” or two. If your cat is not an outdoor cat, this hunting behavior may manifest itself indoors in stalking toys. Pay attention to your cat’s desire to hunt, and try to coax out its inner hunter with feathered toys to gauge its interest., American Wirehairs are usually on the quieter side, preferring play and hunting to lots of meowing. Try engaging your cat in conversation with a few of your best meows to better establish its desire to vocalize. If it is very quiet and meets the other criteria, it could be an American Wirehair., American Wirehairs are affectionate cats that enjoy the company of people. Many American Wirehairs like to follow their owners from room to room, preferring their company to being alone.Just because a cat enjoys your company doesn’t mean it’s a lap cat. Even if your cat doesn’t enjoy being held, it may still be an American Wirehair.
 American Wirehairs are easygoing cats that are not disturbed by minor changes in routine. They are also receptive to learning if you want to reroute undesirable behaviors, for example, offering up a scratching post rather than your favorite chair. Move your cat’s food bowl to a new place to see if it goes with the flow., If you really want to find out for certain if your cat is an American Wirehair, the only way to do so is with a DNA test. Have your veterinarian swab your cat’s saliva to determine what breed or mix it is for sure. It usually takes at least one week to receive results., If you cat is an American Wirehair, it will likely come with a pedigree.

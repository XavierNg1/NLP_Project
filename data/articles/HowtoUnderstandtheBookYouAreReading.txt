 Half the battle is won if you are reading something that draws you and excites your interest. A good taste for books is also needed.;
, Don't rush. If there's a paragraph or sentence you enjoy, read it over. Take your time. Look up a dictionary for the words you don't get. Enjoy the reading thoroughly.
 Compare your understanding of the first chapter to a summary or analysis online. Continue to do that with the other chapters if you feel like you need to. If you feel that you've got the meaning-move on!

, After you get into the book a couple chapters, write down the names and characteristics of the main characters. If you really get to know the characters, you will be able to relate to them and feel for them. Personification will be a better idea.
 Take it at a pace that suits you and take breaks when you begin to feel restless.
 When you reach the end of a chapter and of the end of the book itself, think for a minute about how the book made you feel. Sad? Happy? Confused and befuddled or excited and inspired? Depressed? Upset? Think about it, and use as many adjectives as you can. In doing this, you are deepening your impressions of the book and triggering your learning skills to help you to digest the various meanings in the book.
 Summarize the main points of each chapter in a few lines. This will help you see the full plot.
 If you can, listen to the story on tape. This is always entertaining and if you are someone who enjoys listening, this will probably help you to better decipher and retain the meaning. Apply the theme or the crucial part of the book in your life. You can also apply the story in essays that you write.
 For example, the first chapter of The Hobbit is extremely boring. From chapter 2 on, the book is extremely interesting, involving, among other things, dragons, giant spiders, elves, and a ring of power that makes the wearer invisible. If you start at the first chapter, though, you may have a hard time getting beyond it.

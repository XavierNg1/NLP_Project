 Wash the wound for five minutes under cold water using antibacterial soap to remove obvious dirt from the area and to help avoid infection. You could also use mild dish detergent soap such as Ivory or Joy.Avoid using hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, or iodide as these can actually slow healing., Look to see if the staple is still intact and that no parts of the staple, including any of the adhesive that holds the stick of staples together, have broken off in the wound., Try to pull the staple out in the same angle as it appears to be lodged into the wound. It should come out fairly easily; however, if it does not pull directly out or appears to be stuck or bent, seek medical attention, as you can cause more damage to the surrounding tissues as you pull it out.


For a light staple, use tweezers. Heavier staples (such as those used on wood, of for bigger stacks of paper) may require the use of needle-nose pliers. Whatever you use, dip the tweezers or needle-nose pliers in a rubbing alcohol solution before bringing it anywhere near your wound.
If you find the tweezers or pliers pinching the skin because the staple is flush against the skin, wedge out the staple a little bit with a flat, firm item like a nail file. Again, make sure to dip the nail file or other flat, firm item you selected in rubbing alcohol first.

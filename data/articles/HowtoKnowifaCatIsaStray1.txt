 A cat’s behavior towards people can be a big indicator of whether or not a cat is a stray. Since stray cats have once been socialized, meaning they’ve been around people and most likely lived in a home, they are often not as skittish as feral cats. Stand or sit near the cat and see if it approaches you on its own. If it does, it is probably a stray that is lost.


Crouch down to its level. This may be less intimidating for the cat.
Also pay attention to whether or not the cat approaches houses or cars on its own. Stray cats are more likely to do this.;
, If the cat does not come up to you on its own, try approaching it. It could be the cat is socialized, but is too frightened to come up to you. Try moving toward the cat slowly, all the while talking to it in a soothing voice. If the cat lets you get close or pet it after some coaxing, it is probably a stray., Stray cats will generally be traveling alone, while feral cats often travel as part of a group. Watch to see if the cat is travelling with any other cats. If it is not, it is most likely a stray., A cat’s body language can also give you clues as to whether or not it is a stray. Stray cats will still exhibit similar body language to a domesticated house cat. Look for the following:


Pay attention to how the cat walks. If it walks with its tail in the air, which is a friendly sign, it is probably a stray who has been a housecat at one time or another. However, if it often crawls or stays crouched to the ground, and keeps its tail low as a form of protection, it is probably a feral cat that has never had a home.
Also, a stray cat will probably make eye contact with you while a feral cat will not., The type of vocalizations a cat makes is another way to tell if it is a stray. Stray cats will meow or “answer” you when you speak to them. Depending how long they have been gone from home or on their own, they may even purr when you come near them. Feral cats, on the other hand, don’t usually make any sounds.

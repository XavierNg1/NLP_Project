 Mix 1 tablespoon of ground flax with 2½ tablespoons of water in a small cup. Set the mixture aside so that it can thicken. This will help make the pancake batter thicker. It will also help "bind" it together, much like an egg would., Put the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large mixing bowl. Stir with a fork or spoon until everything is evenly mixed together.
 Pour the non-dairy milk into a separate bowl. Next, add the melted coconut oil followed by the flaxseed mixture. Stir the mixture with a spoon until everything is evenly combined.


If you want to make "buttermilk" pancakes, stir 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar into the milk first.
 The final batter will be a little lumpy, which is good. If you over mix the batter and make it too smooth, the pancakes will be too tough.
 You can leave the pancake mixture as is, or you can add some extra ingredients to make it more flavorful. Here are some ideas to get you started:½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
3 tablespoons dairy-free chocolate chips
3 tablespoons chopped nuts
¼ cup (25 – 50 grams) blueberries, strawberries, or bananas

, If you are using an electric skillet, heat it to 350°F (176.67°C). If you are using a stove (for skillets or griddles), set the temperature to medium-low to medium-high. If necessary, lightly grease the surface with a bit of oil. You can tell if the surface is hot enough for pancakes if a drop of water on it starts to sizzle.


The 5 minutes wait time will also help give you fluffier pancakes.
 Try to make the pancake about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide. When the pancake starts to get large bubbles, it is ready to be flipped over.
 Depending on how large your cooking surface is, you might be able to fry several pancakes at one time.
 You can top them with things like maple syrup, cinnamon, jam, or berries.

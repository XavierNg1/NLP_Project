 Most large companies have workplace computer use agreements that allow them to monitor the sites you visit, the emails you send, and the programs you run. Check with your IT department if you want to see the details of the agreement, but assume that nothing you do at work is private.
 Keyloggers are programs that capture every keystroke you make on your computer. They can be used to reconstruct emails and steal passwords. Keyloggers run in the background, and don't have icons in the system tray or other obvious signs that they are working.


If you are using Windows, press Ctrl+â‡§ Shift+Esc to open the Task Manager. Look in the Process or Background Processes section, and make note of any unfamiliar processes. Google anything that is unfamiliar to see if there are keylogging programs installed.
If you are using a Mac, open the Activity Monitor. You can find this program in the Utilities subfolder of your Applications folder. Look through all of the active processes and note any that are unfamiliar. Use Google to find out if they are malicious or not.
Keylogger processes often take up a lot of resources as they have to track a significant amount of information.
 Programs like ReadNotify embed small, invisible images in your email that allow you to see when the email was opened, where it was opened, how long it was opened for, and if it was forwarded. This can be very useful if you believe that someone is intercepting your messages, as you can track the IP addresses that open the email., If you're really worried about people reading your email who shouldn't be, you can switch to an encrypted email client. Your email will be encrypted, and only recipients that you designate will be able to decode it. It can be a bit of a hassle to set up, but is essential if you are trying to protect highly sensitive information. See this guide for instructions on setting up encrypted email.

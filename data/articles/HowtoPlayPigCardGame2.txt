 The dealer must play shuffle the deck and give 4 cards to each player. The remaining cards will go to a stockpile placed in the center of the circle.
 The gameplay is slightly different from the previous method.


The dealer will draw cards from the stock, and unwanted cards are placed in a separate pile next to the stockpile.
The 4-card limit still applies in this version. You also still can't draw, pick up or discard more than one card at a time.
The dealer can discard cards and replace them as fast as they like.
When the stockpile is empty, the discard pile will be used as the new stockpile.
, This is exclusive to games using the stockpile.

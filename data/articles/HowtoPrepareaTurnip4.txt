 When you peel mature turnips, be sure to take off at least one layer of skin, so the turnips won't taste too starchy. Chop the turnips into 1-inch pieces to so they'll cook more quickly.
 Chop off the green portion of the leeks as well as the tip of the roots. Slice the white portions of the leeks into discs., Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the turnip pieces and 2 teaspoons salt. Blanch the turnips for 1 full minute, then remove the from heat and drain them. Set them aside.
 Let the butter melt completely, then add 1/2 cup water.
 Stew them together until the leeks are soft, about 5 minutes.
 Pour the milk into the pot, and add the thyme and a teaspoon of salt. Cook the soup until the turnips are completely soft, stirring occasionally.
 Working in batches, pour the soup into the a blender and puree it until smooth.
 Serve it with fresh thyme sprigs or a dollop of sour cream, plus salt and pepper to taste.

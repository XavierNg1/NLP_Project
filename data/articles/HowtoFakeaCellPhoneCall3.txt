 If you are going to meet someone and you think you may need a way out, ask a friend to call you at a specific time. Make sure this friend is someone you can rely on to ensure they actually call. Now you only need to fake the content of the call and not the call itself. You can set up some code words in advance to let them know if you need more help or everything is okay.
 Go to the settings on your phone and set an alarm for an estimated time when you may need a reason to excuse yourself. Choose an alert tone which could sound like a ringer. The alarm will continue to go off until you acknowledge it, just like a ringer would. Turn off the alarm and continue with your fake conversation.
 Use someone else's phone to leave yourself a voicemail, or maybe even have them leave it for you. The recorded message should be only one side of the conversation, so that you can speak to yourself when you use this fake call tactic. To use this option, pick up your phone, go to your voicemail screen and play the recording. The benefit to this plan is that you already know what the conversation is, and can practice it in advance. If the room is quite, the other person will also hear a voice in the phone.

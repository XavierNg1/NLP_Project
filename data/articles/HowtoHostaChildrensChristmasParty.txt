 Only list children your child actually likes. Just because you get along with the parents of a child, don't assume that means the child and your kid get along. Keep the list relatively small and manageable.;
, Figure on no more than 4-5 children per adult. If there are any more than that things will get out of hand.
 Remember that it doesn't have to be complicated, and you don't have to feed them an entire meal if you don't want to. Cookies, chips, and punch would be plenty. Remember that it is a party, you don't have to serve only healthy food. Collaborate with your kids on this but remember you have the final say.
 See Tips below for some ideas. Remember that not all the games have to be Christmas related. Ask your child to list their favorite games. What do they play at recess? What games do they play when they're hanging out with their friends?

, This should be upbeat with a relatively fast beat - no Bing Crosby or Nat King Cole for the party. You don't have to play it constantly, but it would be nice for having on when the guests are arriving and during any craft projects or quiet games.
 Inventory what you have before you run out and buy more though! Your home doesn't have to look like the Christmas isles in a store. Just use what you have.
 Be sure to say where you are, what time the party will start, and what time the parents should pick the children up. You may also want to say whether or not they should come prepared for a gift exchange.
 Even if you don't believe in doing anything Christmas related until mid-December, if you wait, schedules will fill up and no one will be able to attend the party!

 If you shower every day, remember that it’s not necessary to wash your hair during every shower. In fact, most experts agree that most people do not need to wash their hair every day, and that daily washings can strip essential oils from your hair that keep your hair and scalp healthy.Unless you have a very oily scalp or exercise and sweat a significant amount, you probably don’t need to wash your hair every day. Try to wash every other day instead.
Not washing your hair can cut your showering time significantly, even by half.
To keep your hair fresh in between washes, you can use a dry shampoo to minimize oil. Though dry shampoo can be helpful occasionally between washes, you shouldn't depend on it to take the place of actually washing your hair., Some people wash their face or even brush their teeth in the shower. These are both things that you can do outside the shower so that you don’t waste your precious shower time. Brush your teeth either before or after taking the shower, and wash your face directly after the shower as opposed to before since the heat of the water helps to open up your pores., Shaving your legs and underarms can take a long time, especially if you do a careful and thorough job. Instead of shaving while you are in the shower, consider shaving the night before.To shave the night before, sit at the edge of your shower and wet your legs, underarms, or wherever else you may regularly shave with warm water. Apply shaving cream and shave carefully, adding water or shaving cream to any dry areas as needed.
Shaving while sitting down can allow you to do a better and more thorough job than you might do while in the shower while you are standing.

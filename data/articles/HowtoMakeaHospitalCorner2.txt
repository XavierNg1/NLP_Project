 The sheet covering your mattress could be either a fitted sheet or a flat sheet that has already been folded into hospital corners (as per the “Folding Hospital Corners” method).
, Note that the sheet will not hang down equally at the head and foot of your bed: it will be aligned with the head of your bed and it will hang down over the foot of your bed.
 The thicker your top blanket, the more difficult it may be to fold hospital corners with. If you really want to mimic military style, the standard blankets we see on top of military beds are not cushy quilts but thick, coarse wool blankets.









Some people like to place the blanket 6 to 12 inches down from the top of the flat sheet (i.e. from the top of the bed); others like to line the blanket up perfectly with the flat sheet. You can experiment with what best suits your tastes.
 Unlike with regular hospital corners, you will not be folding the flat sheet separately from your top blanket; you will fold them simultaneously, so that they are folded together.
 Don’t tuck these in just yet, as you’ll want to work on the top of the bed before finalizing the folds by tucking in the sides.
 Exactly what you do here will depend on how you’ve aligned your flat sheet and blanket, but the end result will be similar no matter what: the sheet will sit folded neatly over top of the blanket. It should look sort of like a cuff on a shirt sleeve or pants.
 Now that you’ve made the appropriate folds at the top and bottom of the bed, you can tuck in the sides. Be sure to hold the sheet and blanket together as you tuck them underneath the mattress.

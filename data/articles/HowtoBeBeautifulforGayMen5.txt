 Fashion trends come and go, and what's popular this season may be out of favor within a month or two. Keeping on top of the latest fashion trends can be very expensive and could deprive you of a more permanent wardrobe. Instead of worrying about what's hot at the moment, choose classics that never go out of style.If you like button-downs or polo shirts wear them, as they are always fashionable.
Ignore trendy takes on classics, like ripped jeans or fringe jackets. Those lose favor very quickly, and tend to cost a lot of money.
 A fitted pant leg will look much more dressy, confident, and attractive than a baggy pant leg. Whether you're choosing a pair of khakis for work or jeans for a night out, go for a more fitted style to get a more appealing look., No matter what occasion you're dressing for, having some basic dress clothes will help you look stylish and feel confident. You don't need to break the bank, either. Look for sales and discontinued items, or simply add one piece of clothing at a time to your wardrobe. Your wardrobe should include::


One solid suit, either black or dark charcoal - opt for a single-breasted jacket with either two or three buttons for a classic look
Dress pants - choose either khaki or dark charcoal to easily coordinate with other parts of your wardrobe
A tie - go for medium-width in a solid color
Dress shoes - try to match your shoes with your belt and your suit color (black or brown are both popular choices)

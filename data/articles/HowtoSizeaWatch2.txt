 Since watches can be worn tightly or loosely, you'll need to decide if the watch is fitting the way you'd like. Check your wrist after wearing your watch to see if it leaves an imprint on your skin. If it does, your watch might be too tight. Or if the watch bothers you by sliding up and down on your arm, you may want to tighten it., To secure the watch to your wrist, consider wearing it on a tighter setting. If you have a metal strap with links, pinch the clasp up towards you. This will show you how many links to remove. Use needle-nosed pliers and a push pin to remove the extra links or take the watch to the jeweler.If you have a fabric or leather strap, use a different hole on the strap to secure it to your wrist.
 If your watch is fitting too snugly on your wrist, add links to the band. You'll need to use links that came with the watch when you bought it or ask a jeweler to add new links for you. Carefully remove the pins from the clasp end and insert the new link. Secure the clasp end back onto the strap.

If you have a fabric or metal strap, use a different hole to secure the watch. If you're on the loosest hole setting, you may need to use an awl to punch an extra hole in the band.
 Use a screwdriver to remove the screws on both sides of the lugs. The lugs are the metal points that hold the strap to the watch itself. The strap should come away easily once you've unscrewed it. Put the new strap in place and screw both sides back into the lugs. Try on the watch and adjust the strap according to your preferences.If you're unsure what size strap you'll need, look on your old strap. Many straps will have the size printed on the underside of the band. If you don't see it, measure the distance between the lugs in millimeters.

 Place a small towel or non-slip mat on the bottom of the shower. Gently place your dog on the mat and tell it to stay. Pet and praise it to keep it calm and happy., Use a removable shower head to gently wet your dog’s coat with warm water. Be sure to use a shampoo specially formulated for sensitive skin (available at most pet stores). Gently lather your dog’s hair to avoid matting it.If your shower does not have a removable shower head, consider washing your Morkie in the sink, or using a cup of water instead. A regular shower might overwhelm your small dog.
 Gently rinse out the shampoo from your Morkie’s hair. To prevent irritation of your dog’s sensitive skin, make sure to remove all soap residue from its body. Lift your dog to ensure that all shampoo is rinsed from its paws as well., Using a soft towel, dry your small dog with long, gentle wipes. To avoid knots and mats in its hair, wipe in the direction of hair growth. When hair is damp, blow dry your dog on a very low setting to dry its coat completely. While drying, gently comb your dog’s hair back into shape.

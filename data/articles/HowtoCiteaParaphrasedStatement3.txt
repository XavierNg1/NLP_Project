 For a book, the reference page citation begins with the author’s last name, a comma, and the author’s first name.


For example: “Bruno, Jess.”
Use a period after the name.
 Next, put the title of the book in italics and after a comma. #*For example: “Bruno, Jess. Feeding Hedgehogs.”


Follow it with a period.
 This looks like: “Bruno, Jess. Feeding Hedgehogs. Fayetteville, Arkansas: Catfish Publications,”


End with the year of publication: “Bruno, Jess. Feeding Hedgehogs. Fayetteville, Arkansas: Catfish Publications, 1995.”

, Click on the corresponding footnote at the bottom to type in your text.


Your citation will look almost exactly like your reference page citation with a few minor differences.
For example: “Jess Bruno, Feeding Hedgehogs (Fayetteville, Arkansas: Catfish Publications, 1995), 22.”
Notice most of the periods are replaced with commas and the publication info is put in parenthesis. You also add the page number where you found the information to the end.
To use a source that was quoted in another source, leave the end reference the same.
However, you will change the in-text citation to include both reference sources: “Joe Jones, Hedgehog Food (Conway, Arkansas: Small Books Press, 1994), 45, quoted in Jess Bruno, Feeding Hedgehogs (Fayetteville, Arkansas: Catfish Publications, 1995), 22.”

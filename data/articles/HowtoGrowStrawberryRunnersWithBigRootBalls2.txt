 Choose the first one from the mother plant. Cut away the stem to the next runner.
 Use a bulb planter to make it easier to put the flower pot in the soil––use it to make a round hole in the garden soil, about 6 inches (15cm) deep and 4 inches (10cm) wide. Wiggle or open the planter in the soil to make a wider hole.
, Turn the slot of the pot towards the mother strawberry plant.
 Strew some earth from the bulb planter into the hole. Then strew some more manure or compost into the hole. Then strew the rest of the earth from the bulb planter into the hole. Press gently on the earth in the pot. Add some garden earth in the hole when desired.
 Fix the runner in the slot.

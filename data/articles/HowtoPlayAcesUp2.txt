 There's only one way to remove cards from the tableau: by finding two or more cards of the same suit, then removing the lower card. Look for pairs like a 2 of hearts and a 5 of hearts, then remove the 2 of hearts.For another example, with a tableau of (8♣, 9♦, 8♦, 5♥), 8♦ is removed because it is lower than 9♦.
Remember the order of the cards. In this game, aces have the highest value, followed by Kings, Queens and Jacks. After the face cards, the numbered cards have descending value, with two being the smallest card.
Place the removed cards in a new discard pile. You'll want the cards in a separate pile: don't place them at the bottom of the stock like some other card games.
 When you run out of matching suited cards, deal out four more. Lay one on top of each row on the tableau, face up. This will display a whole new set of cards that you can match and remove., If you remove a low card and it leaves an empty space behind, you're allowed to move an empty card onto this space. This will come in handy later, because lower cards often get stacked on top of higher cards of a same suit.Always try to move aces onto empty spaces. If an ace of any suit comes out of the stock and you end up with an empty space to put it on, move it right away. The goal of the game is to have only the aces remaining on the tableau, so they'll need to be on the bottom spaces.
 Keep matching cards until you can't match any more, then deal four more cards. Move cards to empty spaces to create new openings when it's possible, always trying to move the aces to the bottom spaces. Keep playing until the stock runs out and there are no more available moves.

 The ideal temperature is somewhere between 45 and 50°F (7 and 10°C).You can, however, store potatoes in places as cool as 38 and 42°F (3.4 and 5.6°C), without affecting the flavor or texture too much.Wherever you decide to store the potatoes, make sure that the temperatures remain consistent. If they change too much, the potatoes may start to rot or sprout.If you store the potatoes below 40°F (4.5°C), use them within 6 to 8 months.If you store the potatoes above 40°F (4.5°C), use them within 3 to 4 months.;
, Save the washing for when you are ready to cook them. If you wash the potatoes first, you risk trapping moisture in the skin. This can cause the potatoes to rot sooner.If the storage area is too dry, your potatoes may shrivel. If this happens, move the potatoes to a place with higher humidity; about 80 to 90 percent would be ideal.Make sure that the potatoes get good air circulation, however, or they will rot., Avoid plastic bags, as they tend to trap warmth and moisture.A mesh or perforated plastic bag is fine, however, because it will allow for air circulation without causing the potatoes to dry out.Here are some other, suitable containers to store potatoes in:


Baskets
Cardboard boxes
Cotton or muslin bags
Wooden crates or boxes

, Ideal storage places include basements, cabinets, closets, and garages.Too much light, especially sunlight, can cause the potatoes to start sprouting. It can also cause the potatoes to overproduce a chemical called Solanine, which causes them to turn green and taste bitter.If you notice the skin turning green, cut it off before you cook and eat the potato.If the green has gotten into the potato flesh itself, throw the potato away.
 These include cabinets beneath the sink and next to large appliances, such as stoves and refrigerators. Potatoes will start to sprout if they are kept in a warm area.

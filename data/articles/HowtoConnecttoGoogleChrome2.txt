 The latest versions of Chrome have streamlined the user switching process significantly. Clicking the active user's name allows you to sign in with another Google account, which will load all of that account's bookmarks and stored passwords in a new Chrome window.


You will need to have signed in with your base account first using the previous method.

 This will open a small window with all of the available users.
 If you don't see this option, perform the following steps:


Click the Chrome Menu button (â˜°).
Select "Settings".
Check the "Enable user creation from the profile manager" box in the "People" section.
 You can sign in with the Google account you want to add to Chrome. A new Chrome window will appear with the user's name in the upper-right corner.
 Once you've added an account, you can quickly switch between them by clicking the active name in the upper-right corner. Each account will open in a separate window.

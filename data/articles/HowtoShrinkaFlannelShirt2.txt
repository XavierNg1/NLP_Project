 If you have multiple flannel shirts to shrink, be sure to wash them one at a time. There will be some dye bleeding due to the heat, so you wouldn’t want multiple shirts discoloring each other.Adding a cup of vinegar to the wash will help reduce color loss.
 Put your machine on its hottest water setting. Use the heavy wash cycle available so the machine will agitate the shirt as much as possible.If you have a front loading machine, see if you can wash the shirt in a friend or family member’s top loader. A top loader provides more agitation, which helps to shrink the shirt., As soon as the wash cycle has finished, remove the shirt from the washing machine. Transfer it to the dryer and dry it using a medium setting. Repeat the washing and drying process if the shirt hasn’t shrunk as much as you’d like.

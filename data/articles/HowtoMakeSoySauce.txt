 You can chop with a knife, but using a food processor is much easier.
 Add flour, and mix until combined., Turn it out onto a flat surface and form it into a log shape., A serrated knife will make this easier.,

Moisten paper towels with water. Lay them all out flat.
Layer the 'dough disks' between the damp paper towels. Start with a towel layer, and end with a towel layer.
Wrap the stack of disks in plastic wrap. Make sure it's wrapped tightly.
Place the entire wrapped package on the baking sheet. Place it in an inconspicuous area, and leave it until the whole thing is completely saturated in mold. This can take a week or more.
 Unwrap the whole package, and place the disks, an inch or two (2 to 5cms) apart, on clean baking sheets. Leave them to dry completely, until they turn brown. It is best to leave them in direct sunlight if possible., Add all of the disks, and cover the pot loosely with plastic wrap., Stir it once a day with the wooden spoon.

When the disks are completely dissolved, the fermentation is complete. This can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months.
 When the dissolving is completed, strain the liquid through cheesecloth into a 'easy to pour' container, like a large measuring cup., It's now ready to serve.

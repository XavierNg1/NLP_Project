 Usually large cocktail glasses, like a hurricane glasses or a goblets, are used for Bahama Mamas. You can also fill a cocktail shaker and pour into a glass later, but by pouring your ingredients directly in the glass you can be sure you have the right amount to fill the cup.;
, To keep track, bartenders use a "count system." 1/2 ounce equals a "two count" (start pouring, count "1,2," and then stop). The slower your count, the stronger the drink. You can also use a shot glass for measurements -- 1 shot equals 1.5 ounces.


Feel free to mix and match different rums (light, dark, coconut, 151 proof, etc.)-- you want a total of 1-1.5 ounces of rum total.
 Most bartenders use banana liquor, but some use cherry or coffee as well. To measure an ounce, use a 4 count ("1,2,3,4," then stop pouring).
 Pineapple is used in almost every Bahama recipe, and orange juice is common as well. Fruit juices are generally a 4 count, but some bartenders just add them to the top of the glass after the alcohol is poured.


Bahama Mamas are usually contain 1 part rum, 2-3 parts juice and liquor. That means you usually have two or three times as much juice as rum.
 Make sure to place it firmly so that it makes a seal. Ignore this step if you have been mixing the ingredients directly in your shaker.
 You do not need to mix for very long -- a quick 2-3 second shake should be enough.
 Garnish the top with a cherry, strawberry, and/or a slice of orange and enjoy!


When possible, always add a paper umbrella on top. This is crucial.

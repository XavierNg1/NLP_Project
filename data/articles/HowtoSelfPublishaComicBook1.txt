 Do you want to build a readership so fans will follow you for more projects, or do you primarily want physical copies of your comic book?


If you want feedback while you write your comic, you should probably publish your comic online.
If you want to give copies as gifts to friends and family or your focus is on getting your work into bookstores, you probably want to start with a print publication.
In general, it's less expensive to start online with a web comic. Then you can sell print copies once you've built a following.;
, Even if you plan to publish a web comic, you may want to research printers for physical copies as well to make your comic a size you like for both the screen and for the page.
 Don't self-publish until you know this.

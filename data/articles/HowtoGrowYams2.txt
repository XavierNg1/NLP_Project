 To ensure that the roots don't meet resistance as they expand, make sure that the soil is very loose and well-drained where you want to plant the yams. When the ground starts to dry in the springtime, till the soil approximately 8 to 12 inches deep and remove debris (i.e. rocks, root pieces, etc.). Spread compost or manure over the soil and till it approximately 8 inches into the ground, to improve the soil's structure.Rake the area, spray it with water, and let it sit for 2 or 3 days before planting., Ensure that you have enough room to accommodate the slips that you'll be planting. Large tubers need a lot of space to grow, as do the vines of the plants, which grow vigorously. Ideally, you should leave approximately a meter of space between each plant., Yams do not grow well in cold temperatures, so it's best to wait until a few weeks after the last frost to plant your slips. Mid spring is the ideal time to do so. Yams require a long growing season, so don't wait too long into the spring or summer to get started., Dig holes about 4" or 5" deep and 3" wide (approximately 10 or 12 cm deep and 7-8 cm wide). Place slips in the holes (dug about 8 to 10 inches apart), positioned with the roots pointing down and the leafy tops above the soil. Very gently fill the holes with soil, being careful not to jostle or bruise the slips too much.Press soil down lightly to get rid of any air pockets.

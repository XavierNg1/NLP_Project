 Wires are commonly used to make fake septum piercings. You can buy various types of wires from your local craft store. Choose a wire that has the color you want but is also easy to bend. You'll also need a pencil and a pair of pliers.;
, You'll trim it down later but to start with go for wire that's 2 to 3 inches in length. Fold your wire around a pencil. This will create the curve you need for a septum piercing. Then, take the pliers and trim down the wire until both sides are roughly the same length. Make a swift, strong cuts with your pliers. You need to make a clean cut for the septum to be safe for use.
 Many septum piercings are decorated with beads. If you want yours to look more elaborate or realistic, consider adding small beads to your fake piercing.








You can buy tiny beads at most craft stores. Pick a color and design you like.
If you want to add beads, pause before creating small loops on either side of your fake piercing. Slide the beads in place and then use your pliers to curve both ends of the piercing.
 You want to sharp edges of the wire to fold out away from the curve. Create two small loops on either side of your fake piercing. This assures that your piercing will not poke or irritate your inner nose when you put it in place.









Then, use your fingers to bend and fold the wire as needed to create a smooth semi-circle that fits your nose. It may take quite a bit of manipulation with your fingers before the wire forms an even semi-circle, so don't get discouraged if it's taking you awhile.

 Spaying and neutering is essential if you do not plan to breed your puggle. Spaying and neutering your dog also helps to keep down the pet population and may even provide some health benefits for your dog.Female dogs that are not spayed are more prone to cancer and infections.
Male and female dogs that have not been neutered or spayed tend to roam more and may also engage in negative hormonal behaviors such as aggression., Since puggles are half beagle, they may be more prone to roaming than other breeds of dogs. If your puggle catches a scent, then he may follow it and become lost. To increase the likelihood that your puggle will be returned if he gets lost, make sure that he is always wearing a collar with an ID tag. The ID tag should include your address and phone number.


You may also want to get your puggle implanted with a microchip to make it easier for people to get her back to you if she ever gets lost and loses her collar as well., Regular veterinary care is essential to your puggleâ€™s health. Take your puggle for a veterinary visit as soon as you get her. Some of the things that your Puggle will need include:


Rabies vaccination
Lyme disease vaccination
Heartworm prevention medicine

, Like most breeds, puggles have some diseases that they are more prone to than other breeds. Make sure that you ask your veterinarian about tests to detect these conditions early. Some conditions that puggles are more prone to than other breeds include:


Hip dysplasia or shallow hip joints which can lead to arthritis
Patellar (kneecap) luxation
Collapsing trachea
Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease (a problem with the blood supply to the thigh bone where it joins the pelvis)

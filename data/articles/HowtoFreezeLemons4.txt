 Juice your lemons using a reamer or juicer that you can pick up at many department stores. If you don't have a reamer or juicer, you can quarter the lemons and push down on the pulp with a fork to extract some of the juice.The goal is to squish the pulp and extract the liquid that is in the fruit.
 Pour your lemon juice into a measuring cup carefully over a sink. Measuring out your lemon juice will allow you to keep more precise measurements for recipes.Make sure to remove any seeds that may have come loose when you juiced your lemon.
 As you pour your lemon juice into the ice cube trays, make sure to take note of how many ice cubes constitute a full cup. This will enable you to make more accurate measurements when you have to use the lemon juice in particular recipes.


These lemon juice ice cubes can also flavor water., Allow your ice cubes to sit in the freezer until they fully freeze. If you don't freeze freshly squeezed lemon juice, it can go bad in two to four days.Keeping your lemon juice frozen in ice cubes will allow you to keep the lemon juice fresh for a longer period.


If you need to use your ice trays, you can transfer the lemon juice cubes to a zip lock bag.

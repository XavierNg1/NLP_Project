 There will be many times when a simple "so long, see ya later" is not how you want to leave things. For those times, you will want to let them know not just that you're leaving their lives, but why, and what you think of the time you spent together.
 This will determine the basic thrust of what you want to say, and how best to say it.


For example, a goodbye letter to a lover will be dramatically different in content and tone than a goodbye letter to a parent or sibling.
 Are you bidding farewell to your recipient in a friendly way, or will this be your last retribution? This is a serious thing to consider before committing anything to writing. A poorly-executed goodbye letter can be confusing not only to the reader, but to the writer as well.


If you are leaving a professional situation, whether saying goodbye to your company or your colleagues, keep the tone friendly and professional.
If you are saying goodbye to real friends, it's likely this is not a permanent goodbye. Keep your tone light and optimistic, and talk about when you meet again.
If you are saying goodbye to a lover, speak honestly, and remember that while things may have changed, they were once close to you. Do not offer false hope, nor spiteful recriminations.

 Seasoned wood should feel light in weight, particularly softwoods. Hardwoods generally weight heavier than softwood, however you should never buy wood by weight as wet wood weighs a lot heavier than dry wood.;
, It should be hard and dry to the touch.
 When you knock two pieces together there should be a hard crisp knock, well seasoned softwoods can sound hollow when knocked.
 A dull thud usually indicates wet unseasoned wood.
 Well seasoned wood shrinks, causing cracks across the tree rings, particularly in hardwoods like Oak. Cracks will not always be present in dry wood but are usually a good sign.
 The bark should be hard and crisp. Often it will have shrunk and split from the wood underneath. If the bark is pliable then the wood has not been seasoned.
 The best and easiest way to test if wood is seasoned is to use a wood type moisture metre, these can be obtained quite cheaply at builders yards or online, e.g on ebay.
 As winter proceeds there is less and less quality seasoned firewood available as suppliers run out of the seasoned wood they have stored. This is particularly a problem this year as the very cold December used up supplies quicker than usual.

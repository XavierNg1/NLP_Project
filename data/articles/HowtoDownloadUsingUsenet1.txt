, News clients (also known as newsreaders) sort and then search each new group. Groups are sorted by subject, author, date and other relevant identifying information. Some news clients are free, others are by subscription, and an internet search will help you find one that’s right for you. Some suggestions are News Bin Pro, Grabit and Mozilla Thunderbird.
 All important releases on Usenet come with NZB packages.


NZB files are packages which contain references to files posted on Usenet, and which simplify the process of downloading by eliminating headers and just delivering the content (headers show the article’s subject, where it was posted, the date it was created, its author, original server and path, to name a few).
Consider using a separate service to catalog the NZB files. There are free and paid options.
To download the NZB, simply click on the box beside it, then select "Create NZB". This will download the NZB file to your computer.

 This can be done by:

Challenging them for the first time in your game. This is one of the main goals, to defeat the entire Pokémon League!
Challenging the Pokémon Elite 4 and Champion again. This is also a good training method (if EXP Share is turned "on") for weaker Pokémon.
Restarting your game to challenge the entire League again. Only do this if:

You want to start a Nuzlocke Challenge.
You have all your Pokémon on another game or in Pokémon Bank.

 You need to be sure your child knows how to enclose itself in a big safety bubble. Just have them visualize (kids are real good at this) their bodies completely surrounded in a bright sunlight gold bubble.
 Your child needs to know they can come to you at any time with fears of what they are seeing/feeling/hearing. Tell them if they are afraid of the spirits, they should tell the spirits out loud and strongly to go away! Most spirits are only showing themselves to the child because they know the child can see them.
 If your child believes in the Angels, this will help immensely. Have them talk out loud to the Angels. Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, etc. Have them talk about their feelings of fear and ask the Angels to watch over them and help them.
 a) Picture something in your mind and write it down. Tell your child to guess what it is. Do the same the other way around. b) Have your child draw who/what they see. c) Walk in a park and hug a tree with your child (sounds silly, but it really helps). Have the child ask the tree to take his/her fears away. d) Have your child try to send pictures to his/her favorite pet and see if the pet responds.
 Anytime your child wants to talk to you about something, you should remain open and available to whatever he/she needs to tell you.

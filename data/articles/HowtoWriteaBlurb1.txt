 Your forum blurb is a quick way to introduce yourself to the group. Blurbs always have an air of mystery and intrigue, since they're just a few words long and leave a lot to the imagination. Make it no more than a sentence long, two at the most. Here are a few examples:


James Franco: Writer. Actor. Director.
I'm Crystal, maker of all things sparkly.
Hi! I'm Zombie666, and I'm ready to fight!
Oshamaru is here to stay . . . get used to it.;
, You have just a few words in which to show off what makes you you. That means you only have room to share the most important things about yourself. Stick to the most interesting or relevant bit of information you can share.
 The tone of your blurb, however short, is going to make people like you or think you're weird.
 You have control over this since you're on an anonymous forum and you get to write whatever you want. Use your anonymity to your advantage and be the person you always wanted to be in real life, but can't.
 Get inspiration from others who participate in your forum to see what blurb style appeals to you.

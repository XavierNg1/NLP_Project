 You can use household Scotch tape, or you can use surgical tape if your skin is a bit more sensitive. You will need one small piece for each eye. Fold one corner of the tape down, so that it creates a little flap that will make it easier to peel the tape off of your skin., The tape will go at an angle on each side of the eye, diagonal from the cheek to the temple. The tape should be placed where you want your eyeliner wings to go. To determine where that should be, imagine two lines extending from the corners of your nose up to the corners of your eyes. The tape should follow that trajectory.








If you are unsure where the tape needs to go, grab an eyeliner pencil or a long straight edge and hold it from the side of your nostril to the corner of your eye. That is the line that the tape should line up with.
Press the tape onto your skin firmly enough that no makeup product can get underneath it.
 Once you are happy with the tape placement, grab your liquid or gel eyeliner. Using a tiny eyeliner brush, paint the product along the edge of the tape. The tape will ensure that the line of the wing is perfectly straight, and also guarantee that your wings are even on both sides.
 Once youâ€™ve created your wings, gently peel away the tape. You should be left with two even eyeliner wings with crisp, straight edges where the tape was. If necessary, you can use your small eyeliner brush to add product anywhere necessary.

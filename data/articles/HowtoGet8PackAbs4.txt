 Grab an exercise mat and place it on a hard flooring surface like tile, wood, or linoleum. Alternatively, you can place a towel on a carpeted or hard floor. Make sure you will have enough room to fully extend your legs on the towel or mat.You can also do knee-ins while seated on the edge of a flat bench.
 Sit on the floor with you legs and knees extended in front of you. Your legs should be straight and your toes pointing toward the ceiling. Make sure your toes and knees are aligned in a straight line. Place your hands under your buttocks.
 Slowly bring your knees to your chest while keeping your legs together. Then slowly extend your legs back to your starting position. Make sure your back remains straight while you are doing the knee-ins.


Repeat 12 to 15 times, and then do a second set of seated knee-ins.
You can also do 3 sets of 10 knee-ins each.

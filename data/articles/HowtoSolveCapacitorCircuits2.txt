 A series circuit has only one loop with no branching paths. Capacitors in the circuit are arranged in order within the same loop. 

, Given the voltage and capacitor values for each, find the total capacitance. To calculate the total capacitance in a series circuit, use the formula 1CT=1C1+1C2+1C3{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{C_{T}}}={\frac {1}{C_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{C_{2}}}+{\frac {1}{C_{3}}}}.   

For example: A series circuit has three different capacitors of value C1 = 2F, C2 = 3F, C3 = 6F. Plug in to the formula 1CT=12+13+16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{C_{T}}}={\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{6}}} and solve for CT. Adding the fraction and taking the inverse, CT = 1F.
 The total charge in a circuit depends on the total voltage and the total capacitance in a circuit. This relationship is given by the equation Q=CV{\displaystyle Q=CV}.  

For example: The circuit has a total capacitance of 1 F and total voltage of 10 V. Plug in the given to the equation and solve for Q: Q=1âˆ—10=10C{\displaystyle Q=1*10=10C}


, For a series circuit, charge across each capacitor is the same and equal to the total charge in the circuit. 

For example: The total charge in the circuit is 10 C. Then the charge in C1 is 10 C, C2 is 10 C and C1 is 10C.
 Rearranging the equation Q=CV{\displaystyle Q=CV} to V=Q/C{\displaystyle V=Q/C}, the voltage across each capacitor can be calculated.  

For Example: The charge is 10 C for all capacitors and capacitance values are 2 F, 3 F and 6 F respectively.

Voltage across first capacitor is V1 = Q1/C1 = 10/2 = 5V

Voltage across second capacitor is V2 = Q2/C2 = 10/3 = 3.3V

Voltage across third capacitor is V3 = Q3/C3 = 10/6 = 1.7 V

Note that the sum of individual voltage equals the total voltage in the series circuit. 


, Once the voltage and charge in each capacitor is calculated, the circuit is solved. Label these information in the circuit drawing to keep everything organized.  .

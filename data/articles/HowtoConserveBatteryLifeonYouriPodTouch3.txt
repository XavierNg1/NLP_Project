 "Settings" is the grey gear icon--it should be on your iPod's home screen.
 You can enable Low Power Mode, which automatically adjusts your settings to conserve more power, from here.


Low Power Mode requires iOS 9 or higher.
You can also turn on the "Battery Percentage" option from this menu. This will display a number indicating your battery's remaining percentage of life, which will allow you to budget your current battery life more efficiently.
 While Low Power Mode doesn't necessarily afford you the utmost battery life possible, it does optimize your system preferences (brightness, background app refresh rate, and system animations), resulting in a noticeable difference in battery life.High-performance apps, such as games or advanced software, will probably slow down considerably when in Low Power Mode.
 Your iPod Touch should now be in Low Power Mode!

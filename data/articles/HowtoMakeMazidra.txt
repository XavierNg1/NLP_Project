 This can be done with a leftover lentil stew or done fresh overnight in the Crock-Pot. You'll want approximately one cup of finished lentils for each person you are going to feed.
 A rice cooker is quickest with the least chance of burning. Approximately one and a half cups of cooked rice per person, but more is better than less, and this is delicious.,, For vegans, you can use the pre-shredded non-dairy cheese. For non-vegans, cheddar works well.,,

Rice first, flattened out onto the plate.
Lentils second, ladled over the rice.
Cheese next, so it will melt onto the legumes.
Then sprinkle the veggies in 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) layers, or as desired.
Top with guacamole, sour cream or salsa if desired.

 If you believe your dog has had a stroke, the first thing to do is keep calm. Your dog will need your help in order to survive, so keep your wits about you and focus on helping your pup.
 Put the dog in a quiet, warm environment. Make him or her as comfortable as possible by placing it on a padded bed and removing nearby furniture it could hurt itself on.


If your dog is unable to stand, turn it to lie on the opposite side of its body every half an hour to reduce the risk of pneumonia because of blood pooling in one side of his lungs.
Put water near your dog so it can drink without getting up. If it doesn't want to drink for a long time, wipe its gums with a wet cloth to give it some moisture.
 If this emergency happens on a weekend or late at night, call your vets emergency line. If you get not response, you may need to find an emergency veterinary clinic to take your dog to.


Make note of your dog's symptoms so you can relay them to the veterinarian over the phone. It's important to know the strength and length of symptoms, so that you can properly communicate the severity of your dog's condition to the vet.
 The priorities for treatment of a dog that has had a stroke include minimizing swelling to the brain and maximizing oxygen to the brain.This will be done with medication and medical care. In addition, your veterinary office will be able to take care of secondary concerns, such as keeping your dog hydrated and comfortable.

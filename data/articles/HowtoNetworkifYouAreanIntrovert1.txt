 If possible, get a list of people attending the event ahead of time. Reach out to people you'd like to meet up with via e-mail. Send a short, quick e-mail that says something like, "Hi, I loved your book and it looks like we'll both be at the conference next week. I'd love to meet up."You can also read up on attendees' interests and experience so you'll have something to ask about to break the ice. For example, "So, you went to University of Michigan? I got my masters there.";
, You can ease yourself into socialization if you arrive before an event is too crowded. Arriving early means you can identify people to talk to and strike up a conversation with a smaller group. You'll be less overwhelmed, as you'll be exposed to people gradually rather than all at once., Do you have a more extroverted friend or co-worker attending the event? Ask them for help. Ask whether they want to attend together and you can stick by them if you're feeling overwhelmed. They can help introduce you to others so you don't have to make the first move if you feel intimidated.Make sure the person is okay helping you out, however. You can easily annoy a colleague by following them around if they prefer to be left alone.
 It can be hard to have deep conversations if you're feeling overwhelmed by an event. Instead, strive to have brief conversations with a variety of people who interest you. Get contact information from these people. You can build the relationship later by following up via e-mail and meeting one on one., If you start to feel drained by a networking event, it's okay to step away and recharge for a few minutes. If you need a few minutes, politely end a conversation by saying you need to get a drink, run to the restroom, or something similar. Step out for a minute to relax before returning to the event.

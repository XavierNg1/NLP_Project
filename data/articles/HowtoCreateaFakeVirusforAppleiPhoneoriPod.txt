, The first one that you see this may be different on your iPod or phone that you are using. Find the one that says photo memory or photo album or something near that concept. Click that; it will show you the photos that were recently taken.
 Click it; it will show you what that will look like as a background––not a home screen background. Once you click set, it will pop up. If you want it to be a lock screen or home screen, click home screen, which will set it as the home screen background. Then click Done or Enter or maybe even Set.

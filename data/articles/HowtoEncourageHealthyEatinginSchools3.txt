 This program is for middle and high school students. This program teaches students the skills to bring about positive changes by working with the administrators and cafeteria staff and teaching fellow classmates about nutrition and healthy eating habits.
 School lunch provides a nutritious meal for students. Supporting the school lunch program helps schools continue to be able to feed students properly throughout the day. Students can set an example by trying new things when offered.
 The feedback a student-based focus group provides is very valuable to school food service directors. The students help make decisions and the school provides better food the students like so everyone wins.

 Place 1/2 cup of softened butter and 3/4 of a cup of packed brown sugar into a mixing bowl. Use a spoon or hand mixer to cream the butter and brown sugar until they're light and fluffy.If the butter is hard, you can set it on a plate or in a bowl and soften it using the microwave. Just ensure that you don't melt the butter.
 Stir in 1 egg, 1 tablespoon of milk, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Mix the ingredients until they're completely combined. Check to make sure that the egg has been completely beaten into the other ingredients.If you don't have vanilla extract, consider substituting almond extract or you could just omit it.
 Add 1 1/4 cup of flour, 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, and 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt to the creamed mixture in the mixing bowl. Use a spoon or the hand mixer to mix in the dry ingredients until they're just combined. Gently stir in just 1/2 a cup of the chocolate chips.Avoid mixing the dough too much or the chocolate chip cookie bars will be tough.
 Grease and flour an 8-inch square baking dish that's safe to use in the microwave. Scoop your dough into the dish and spread it evenly using a rubber spatula or spoon. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of chocolate chips over the cookie dough.You can also use cooking or baking spray to prepare the baking dish.
 Cook the chocolate chip cookie bars in the microwave on high for 3 1/2 minutes. Check the bars to see if they're dry and feel firm. If they're still raw, cook them in 20 second increments, checking frequently to see if they're done. Let the bars cool before you cut and serve them.Your microwave should rotate the bars as they cook. If your microwave doesn't have a rotating tray, turn the baking dish a quarter turn after every minute it cooks.

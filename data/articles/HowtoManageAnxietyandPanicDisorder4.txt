 Simply speaking our worries or concerns aloud to someone else can be cathartic and gratifying. Anxious thoughts so often run on a loop in our heads that we believe them to be fact. Speaking to a close friend or relative who can impartially give you advice might help. Stating your concerns aloud might help you to view them as unlikely or silly, or your friend might help you to see that these concerns are not warranted.
 Support groups can be found locally through mental health and religious organizations. You can also join support groups online or by telephone. Participating in such groups reduces the burden of managing anxiety or panic disorder on your own. You can learn helpful strategies to cope with symptoms from individuals who have been in your shoes. What's more, support groups offer invaluable encouragement and foster the development of lasting friendships.Studies reveal that anxiety sufferers benefit from the social support offered in a group setting. Friends or family members may not be able to relate to what you are going through, but others like you can empathize with your situation and offer hope.

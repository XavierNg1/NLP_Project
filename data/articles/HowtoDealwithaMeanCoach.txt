 Be early, or right on time to each practice and game. Offer to help with equipment. Greet your coach when you arrive. It may seem a little awkward at first, but you'll both soon grow used to it. It will improve the coach's mood as well.
 This means that if your coach is mean to you for no reason, someone else can back you up as you tell your coach that what he or she is doing is wrong.

, This shows the coach that you are serious and eager to learn.
 When the coach sees you, he/she won't have a reason to be angry at you. In fact, he/she might even be proud of you.

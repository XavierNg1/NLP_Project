 See their point of view and understand their full opinion. It is important to know all answers to questions presented on their side as well as your own. If you know all their answers you can search for reasons why yours is better. Agree that they make valid points and prove that you understand what they are saying and why.


Use their sides positive points to enhance your own by comparing facts and end with why your facts overpower theirs.
Give credible examples and present your intention as the best.
Do not belittle your opponent or their opinion. Treat them as an equal and show them that with your help you can both be influenced into greatness.
 Your opponent will challenge you with questions of "why." They will also reveal all the negativities on your point of view but you can win them over by showing you're dedicated and committed to your knowledge.
 As stated above, people listen to those who are experienced. If you prove your expertise on the subject your opponent will want to gain that same education and acceptance as you.


They might think they are an expert on their side as well but once they see the devotion in your point they will start second guessing themselves. If they think you truly believe what you are saying, they will start to believe it themselves.

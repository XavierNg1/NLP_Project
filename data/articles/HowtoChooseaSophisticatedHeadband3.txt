 A little detailing on the band can be stylish in a mature way, but too much can have the reverse effect. For instance, a carefully placed fake flower can make a headband look decorative, but a band completely covered in fake flowers will look youthful rather than mature.
 A scarf headband is a thick headband with two extra pieces of fabric hanging off the ends. Tie this fabric beneath your hair and let it hang down in a knot or bow. This combines the look of a thick headband with the look of a scarf. Both items are chic accessories, and the combination works well to create a sense of fashion forwardness.
 A small, carefully placed bow may look mature, but bows can easily look girlish, instead. Look for a thick headband with a small cloth bow placed on the side, and gravitate toward bows made from glossy materials. Avoid headbands with large bows, brightly colored bows, bows with loud patterns, or bows placed at the top center of the band.
 Feathers can also look immature if worn the wrong way. Look for dark feathers that curve alongside a stiff plastic or cloth-covered band. Avoid crazy colors like hot pink or neon orange, unless these colors are carefully matched with black or another neutral. Also avoid feathered headbands that have feathers sticking straight up.
 A small crystalline brooch placed at the side of the headband adds just enough glitz to the accessory to make it sophisticated.
 Small cloth flowers or woven plastic flowers are both good options. Avoid headbands that are covered in multiple, brightly colored flowers. Instead, opt for a band with one flower or one subdued cluster of flowers.

 Women love a funny guy. Puff your chest out a tiny bit pull your head back. That's what cocky feels like; a little swelled up and goofy. When you mix a little bit of cocky and a little bit of funny, you can get amazing results. Women don't just appreciate humor, they appreciate humor along with sexiness and social tact.

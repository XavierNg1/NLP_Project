 It is good for your physical and mental health to keep busy with things that do not cause you stress. Make plans with your friends and family, but not any that can't be broken. Ask them to go on walks with you, or go grab some lunch. These are things that you may not have time for once your baby arrives.


Invite friends over for a movie night. If you are too tired to leave your couch, ask your friends to come camp out with you and watch a movie and order takeout. This is a great way to spend time with people and not have to strain your body.
 Use this time to invest in your relationship before a time that may cause stress, or at a minimum will cause a great change in your life. You and your partner can go for a picnic, go to dinner, or rent a hotel room for a night. It is important to show each other attention now, before your attention will shift to your new baby.
 If you already have children, appreciate the dynamic and relationship you have with them before your new addition comes. Help prepare them by talking about the new change that is coming, and telling them how much you love them.

 The decision comes down to your budget and what you’re comfortable working with. There are professionally made rests available for purchase that will secure your rifle, or you can use sandbags to create a firm rest.


It is essential that the rifle does not move during the sighting process. Whichever rest method you use is fine as long as there is no movement.
Depending on the rest you use, you may need to prop the front or the rear of the rifle with sandbags.
 Depending on the location that you’re shooting, you may have access to different options. Comfort is not especially necessary since you won’t be firing much from this position.


If you are using a firing range, you may be able to use a bench at the facility.
If you are shooting in the wild, you can either set a bench or table up yourself, or assemble the rest on the hood of a car.
If you are prepared to lie down, you can set your rest up on the ground, provided that there is enough clearance to safely shoot.
 If you are using a gun vise as a rest, make sure that it is fastened securely. Wedge the butt securely into sandbags and rest the stock on another. Make sure that the rifle is as stable and secure as possible.


The only thing moving should be the trigger when you squeeze it.

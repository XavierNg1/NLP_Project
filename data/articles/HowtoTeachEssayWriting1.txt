 Before you can teach someone else how to write, you have to develop an understanding of what to teach and how to teach it.


If you're a classroom teacher, you can strengthen your knowledge of how to teach writing through in-service training and college classes.
If you're homeschooling your children, look for a writing curriculum that helps you teach the preliminary skills for writing essays and other forms of writing. It should also help you assess your child's writing skill level to help you find an appropriate starting point.;

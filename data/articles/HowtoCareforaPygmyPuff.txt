 You might try to look at lists of baby names online. Another suggestion is to name is after your favorite fictional character. Maybe try a name starting with A to carry on the tradition from Arnold, Ginny's puff.
 Pygmy Puffs, like Puffskeins, will eat almost anything. So do not let your pet go anywhere near your wand... or your phone. Maybe just some crackers and water.
 You might not want your Pygmy Puff to feel alone and abandoned because it will probably eat your things. You should spend time playing with your Pygmy Puff. They are nearly indestructible so you don't have to be as careful with it as you would another animal such as a rat or an owl.
 A shoebox is an ideal box.;
,, If you don't have a small blanket, use a piece of fleece fabric cut into a rectangle or square shape.
 Make sure it's nice and soft.
, Every night read your Puff a story. Make sure you don't read violent stories, otherwise your puff might have nightmares.

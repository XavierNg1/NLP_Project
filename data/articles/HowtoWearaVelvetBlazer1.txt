 While a standard velvet blazer is nice, you can add extra “wow” factor by picking a blazer that has unique features. For example, sharp shoulders, exaggerated lapels, funky draping, or an hourglass waist. Women’s velvet blazers look gorgeous with cuffed or 3/4 length sleeves that taper from loose in the upper arm to fitted at the forearm.Consider a blazer that’s either high-waisted or extra long.
Go to the extreme: look for a blazer that’s super fitted, or loose at the torso and slim-armed but with big shoulders.
To make your blazer even more unique, add your own custom buttons. For example, large vintage pearl-faced buttons.;
, You can pair your blazer with a wide variety of tops. Turtlenecks are great for colder months. In warmer months, try wearing a light-colored or printed camisole.Or, try a polo shirt, button-down shirt, or plain t-shirt underneath.Tops with solid colors or microprints go great with velvet blazers.
 Velvet blazers look especially put-together with dark denim jeans. Alternately, don a denim skirt with your blazer. Lean towards dark-washed denim if the hue of your velvet blazer is dark but bold.Some velvet colors that pair well with denim are lipstick red, forest green, royal blue, and deep burgundy., Consider a short, printed dress for a fun, flirty look. You can wear this look with or without tights. Pair it with flats or a cute ankle boot.
 This look can transition day to night by bringing only a change of undershirt and shoes in your bag. For example, try wearing a cotton shirt and simple flats in the daytime. Switch it out for a silk top and standout heels for evening wear., Find a scarf that is formal but stands out. For instance, a sapphire blue silk with a fancy paisley.

 Many people get blisters because their socks rub against their feet. Runners are especially prone to this problem. Avoid cotton socks, which absorb moisture and are more likely to cause blisters. Instead, choose nylon or wicking socks, which do not absorb moisture. These are more breathable and will help protect your feet., Many blisters are caused by shoes that donâ€™t fit properly, especially shoes that are too small. You may find that your shoe size can vary a half-size in one day. Try on shoes when your feet are most swollen during the day to ensure that the shoes will be big enough to comfortably fit your feet., Moleskin can be used to cushion and protect a blister and you can also use it to prevent blisters if you are prone to them. Cut a small piece of moleskin and stick it to your shoe or foot at the spot where you may start to get a blister., Reduce friction on your feet by using talcum powder. This will help soak up moisture that may otherwise cause blisters.Sprinkle a bit of talcum powder inside your socks before putting them on.
 Certain plants, such as sumac and poison ivy, can give you blister rashes. If you need to handle these types of plants, take precautions by wearing gloves, long pants, long-sleeved shirt and shoes.

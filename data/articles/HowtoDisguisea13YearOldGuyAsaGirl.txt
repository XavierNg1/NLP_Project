 You must have a girl present, otherwise it could go horribly wrong. Plus you might need to use some of her stuff. Try to get a girl you can trust and won't take pics or tell anyone.;
, If you go with hair extensions, they need to be the same colour as the boys hair. Get the girl to help you with this and get her to style the hair the way you want it to look.
 You need clothes that compliment your body so you look more feminine. You also need to tell the girl what you want to look like so she can buy you the right stuff. If you have an Adams apple try to cover it up with a shirt that covers your neck. Get the girl to help you adjust the clothes so it looks convincing.
 You will need panties and a bra. You need tight panties so it doesn't look masculine. Try to stuff the panties a little bit do give it some shape. Next you need to stuff the bra with the appropriate sized material. Try to get a bra that shows through your shirt or make it so your bra strap is showing.
 try to get make up that looks good on your skin. Try using mascara, eye liner, lipstick/lip gloss and blush. Get the girl that is helping you apply the makeup so you don't look stupid.
 try to get heels but if you don't think you could walk properly in them just get some nice girly flats.
 It's OK for guys to sit to go pee, especially when you're in public. If you are in public, two things you HAVE TO REMEMBER people think you're a girl, so go in the girl's washroom and sit down so it sounds right.
 Don't try to have a really high pitched voice. Just try to make it a little feminine but don't go overboard.
 Make sure it's easy to remember.

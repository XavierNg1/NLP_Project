Measure the dog’s height- males are generally 22-24 inches tall, as measured at the shoulder, while females are 21-23 inches tall.In less typical cases, an Irish Water Spaniel can grow to 26 inches tall., Weigh the dog to see if its mass is in keeping with the breed’s official standards. Irish Water Spaniels are well-built, robust dogs that are considered medium sized. Males weigh between 55-68 pounds, while females generally weigh between 45-58 pounds., You can visually identify an Irish Water Spaniel quite easily by its unique coat. Look for long, loose, liver-colored curls and an overall dense coat of hair. The breed has a topknot- i.e. cascading curls that cover the skull and fall over the top of the head, and ears.Despite its thick coat, the Irish Water Spaniel is known for shedding very little.
 The Irish Water Spaniel has long, lobular ears. Note whether the dog’s ears hang close to its head, and if they’re set low. Ears should be covered with thick, long, loose curls of deep brown hair., To identify an Irish Water Spaniel, look for the breed’s distinctive “rat tail”. The tail is low set and tapers to a fine point, reaching just above the point of the hock. The tail is also thick at the root, and the top 2 or 3 inches are covered by the breed’s trademark curls, which stop abruptly and fade into smooth, fine hair., To check for webbed feet, a very distinctive characteristic of the Irish Water Spaniel, observe the dog’s paws closely. The feet should be covered with hair and webbed between the toes, a characteristic that makes the breed excellent at swimming. Feet should also be round spreading.The breed also has tough pads under its feet, which allow it to avoid injury when passing over sharp surfaces like river rocks.

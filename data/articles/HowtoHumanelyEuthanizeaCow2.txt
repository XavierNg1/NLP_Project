 Only a certified, practicing veterinarian can perform this method legally because they are the only ones who have access to the drugs to do so. You cannot get sodium pentobarbitalÂ  yourself anywhere without a license as a practicing veterinarian, because this drug is under federal jurisdiction for use and storage.
 If the animal is ambulatory and unable to stand quietly while a needle is stuck into them, you will need to place them in a head-gate or squeeze chute (preferably one that has sides that open up for access to drag the deceased animal out afterwards) so that the vet can perform the task as safely as possible., Basically, the vet will be performing this method by giving the animal 60 to 80 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital intravenously. This will be enough to produce rapid unconsciousness and anesthesia followed by respiratory depression, hypoxia (oxygen deprivation in body tissues), and cardiac arrest., Animals overdosed with barbiturates cannot be used for human nor animal consumption because of the toxic barbiturates present in the tissues which can harm wildlife or stray animals. Carcasses must be properly buried or incinerated as necessary.

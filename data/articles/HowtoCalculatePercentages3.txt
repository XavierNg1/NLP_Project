 Sometimes you're given the percentage of an amount and need to know the numerical value of the percent. Examples include calculating taxes, tips, and loan interest.
 Say you borrowed money from a friend who is going to charge you interest. The amount borrowed was initially $15 and the interest rate is 3% per day. These are the only two numbers you need for the calculation.
 Multiply the percent by .01 or simply move the decimal to the left two places. This turns 3% into .03.
 In this case, multiply 15 by .03. This comes to 0.45. In this example, $0.45 is the amount of interest accrued each day that you do not pay your friend back.

 The registry information is usually spread by word of mouth. Sometimes it is also sent to guests in the invitation or posted on the couple's wedding website. The items on the registry are things that the bride and groom picked themselves so whatever you choose to buy will be a good gift.Look the registry over carefully and, if possible, take a copy with you when shopping. Avoid buying anything that duplicates the wedding registry.
Choose a gift that can fit many homes’ styles. if you can't use the registry to help you match the couple's style, then avoid gifts that are distinct in color or style. Stick to items that would match many color and style schemes.
 You may be able to find a gift that matches their interests. For example, if they like wine, you could buy them a wine rack or decanter. Matching their tastes can make for a thoughtful gift that the couple can really enjoy.
 If you are crafty or artistic, consider putting those skills to use in making a gift. If possible, ask someone that knows them if the newlyweds would appreciate a piece of art or a practical item you can craft. If they would, spend serious time and effort on your creation and make sure that it is not thrown together the night before. Some examples of created gifts include:


A painting of a specific place you know the couple has been to, or is interested in.
A clay or blown glass bowl, vase or candle holder.
A wooden cutting board with the date of the wedding and the couple’s names burned into it.

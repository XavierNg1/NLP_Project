Stitch a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) seam.
 If there are problems, these could be the reasons why:


The seam is too short: allow a bit more fabric to show past the foot as you work it through the machine
The seam is too large: if you aren't feeding the fabric into the machine carefully enough, it can be helpful to make a guide marker 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the needle. You can do this using a dab of liquid paper or a bit of masking tape.
The guide on the machine might be causing the seam allowance to come down too much as you sew; if so, use your own sense of guidance instead.

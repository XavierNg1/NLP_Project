 If you are serious about and ready for a career change, then you don't want to make a rash decision. Part of what you can do to determine if you are ready is decide what you want out of a new career. Some possibilities include:Professional or intellectual challenges you don't find in your current career.
Greater responsibility than your current career allows, such as the opportunity to manage others.
A more flexible schedule, or one that fits your other commitments and interests.
Chances to pursue interests that aren't related to your current career.
 Many tests have been developed to assess how the skills and interests you have relate to potential careers. If you are considering a career change, take one of these tests and see if the results sound like professions that would interest you. You can ask a career center about one of these tests, and many are freely available online as well. Some well-known career tests include:The Strong Interest Inventory (SII)
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
The Career Ability Placement Survey (CAPS)

, If you're curious about a new career path and wondering if you're ready to switch to it, talking to someone who works in the field will help you get an inside view. Consider what you learn from them--the good and the bad--to help you decide if you're ready for the switch.Ask for a no-strings attached informational interview.
Job shadow a friend or contact working in the career you're interested in.
Make sure to ask about both positives and negatives in the new career. If the downsides seem like too much, then you may not be ready for a career change.

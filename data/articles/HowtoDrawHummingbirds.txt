, This will be the body.


Make sure the place where the body and head meet is underneath the head, not on top of it.

Hummingbirds' other trademark is their beak, which they can poke into even the narrowest of flowers to extract nectar, so make sure to get this part right.
 Use a fringe line for the body to reproduce the shape of small feathers. Make the shape of the wings and draw both small and big feathers inside. Draw feathers for the tail as well.
 Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional.
 Look at the illustration for reference.

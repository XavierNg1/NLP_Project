 If you're suddenly missing your bookmarks tool bar or some other component that you're used to seeing, a simple fix may be found in the "View" menu. It's located in the upper left part of your screen, along the top menu bar. 'View" should be the 4th option from the left after the "Firefox", "File", and "Edit" menus. Under that menu look for "Toolbars" and "Sidebar" menus for specific components to be toggled as viewable or hidden.


If checked, the tool bar is currently visible, if unchecked it is currently hidden.;
, The right click allows you to quickly change the view of the browser by hiding or unhiding your toolbars.


Consider customizing your tool bars. Firefox's upper right corner settings menu offers a "Customize" option which allows you to drag and drop various shortcut icons into your browser window., If you suddenly find your navigation bar missing (the area with your current internet address), there are a few things you can try. The first is simply opening a new browser window. Ctrl+N is a quick shortcut for PCs, while âŒ˜ Cmd+N is the shortcut for Macs.Note: The new window method will restore the navigation bar if the underlying issue is a pop-up window that has hidden this tool bar., This file, which stores the current browser session data, is located in the Firefox profile folder and can be accessed through Help -> Troubleshooting Information->Profile Folder (under Application Basics). Once found, click the button to the right labeled either "Show in Finder" (Mac) or "Show Folder" (PC) then delete.Deleting this file effectively restores Firefox to its settings before you began the session and may be able to bring back your tool bars in the process.

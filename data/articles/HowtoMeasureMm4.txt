 If you are given a measurement in inches, you can convert that measurement into millimeters by dividing it by a conversion factor of: 0.039370There are 25.4 mm in 1 inch. This is not a constant ratio, however, which is why you need to use a conversion factor rather than adding 25.4 mm for every inch.

Example: 9.3 inches / 0.039370 = 236.22 mm

, To find an equal millimeter value when you know the length of something in feet, you must divide the number of feet by a conversion factor of: 0.0032808Example: 4.7 feet (1.4 m) / 0.0032808 = 1432.58 mm

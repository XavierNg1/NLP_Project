 Adopt a regular cleaning schedule for the floors. Sweep the floors or vacuum them with the brush attachment. Wipe down the floors with a damp (but not soaking wet) mop. Do not let water pool on the floors as you clean. Make sure you dry the floors well at the end of every clean.Try to get into the habit of cleaning the hardwood floors at least once a week. Doing this will ensure dirt, grime, and salt do not damage the floors.
Do not use too much water to clean your hardwood floors, even if they have a sealant. A damp but not soaking wet wipe, swiffer, or mop works fine.
 One of the major ways salt can get onto your floors is if it is tracked through your home on dirty shoes. This is a common problem in winter in areas that put salt on the snow, as the salt then gets onto the bottom of people’s shoes. Place floor mats by your doors so shoes that have salt on them do not make contact with the hardwood floors.Get waterproof or water resistant mats so the water and salt do not soak through the mats onto the floor.
You may also lay towels over the mat so you can throw the towels in the wash later without having to move the mat.
If possible, you may want to install a different type of flooring at the door, such as tile.
 To avoid salt from shoes on your floors, have a “no shoes inside” policy. Ask guests to take off their shoes and leave them by the door. Remind people you live with to take off their shoes before coming inside.You may keep slippers by the door for guests who do not want to walk around your home barefoot. This way, your floor is still protected and your guests feel comfortable.
 Stock a few clean towels by the door so you use them to wipe up any water or salt on your floors. Never let water sit on your hardwood floors, as it can warp the wood. Salt sitting on the floors can also cause damage.Try having a towel basket or bin by the front door so towels are always handy in the event you need to wipe up a spill or salt on the floors.

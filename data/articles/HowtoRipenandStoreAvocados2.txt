 There are times when you'll need a ripe avocado immediately and simply don’t have one. In those cases, you can heat the avocado in the oven to help soften them. Preheat the oven to 200 F (93 C).


The oven is superior to the microwave for ripening avocados rapidly. The microwave can leave the avocado mushy and tasteless.An avocado that’s softened in the oven won’t have the same buttery flavor that a truly ripe avocado does, but it will be softer and easier to peel, cut, and mash., Baking the avocado in the oven will help it to produce ethylene, which is a gas produced by many plants that promotes ripening. To trap that gas and help the avocado soften, wrap the avocado in aluminum foil.Instead of using foil, you can also place the avocado in a baking dish with a tight-fitting lid. This is particularly useful if you're trying to soften multiple avocados.
 Place the avocado in the oven and bake it for an hour. Any less and the avocado won’t be soft enough to pass as ripe. When the hour is up, remove the avocado from the oven. Give it a gentle squeeze through the foil to test for softness. Return the avocado to the oven for 10-minute increments if it still feels firm.


When the avocado is soft and gives to gentle pressure, set it aside and let it cool in the foil.
 Once the avocado has cooled to the touch, about 30 minutes, remove the foil. Now that the avocado is soft, you can cut it, mash it, or add it to any of your favorite dishes.

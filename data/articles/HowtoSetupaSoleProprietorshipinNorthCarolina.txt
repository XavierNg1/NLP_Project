 You will need to fill out forms only if you are required to have an employee identification number (EIN) or if you are registering an assumed name for your business.


Go to the county clerk's office in the county in North Carolina in which you will be doing business. Ask the county clerk what you will need to set up your sole proprietorship. This may include an employee identification number (EIN) if you have 1 or more employees. You can apply for an EIN online at www.irs.gov. There is no fee for obtaining an EIN.
Look up your business name (if it is anything other than your given name) at the clerk's office to make sure it hasn't been used. Obtain an assumed name application from the county clerk, or go online to www.blnc.gov. Click on "start your business," then click on "business forms," where you will see a certificate of assumed name application form. There is no fee for obtaining the form, but there will be a fee upon submitting it.
Fill out the assumed name form. This will include the name of the business, and the names and addresses of all owners of the business.;
, Use your local bank where you have an account to have a notary sign the form, where you won't be charged a fee.
 Look in the phone book or online to find out the address and phone number of the office. Ask in advance what form of payment your county clerk's office will accept for fees associated with submitting the assumed name form.
 Prepare to pay a fee for submitting your form, which may vary from county to county.

 Reading Homestuck will most likely change your life, in all actuality, so it is important you get yourself ready! Proceed with extreme caution. It is a crazy adventure full of feels, fanfiction, cross-shipping, confusing plots, morbid deaths and a whole lot of pain.;
, Homestuck uses Flash, which means that it has interactive games, videos, and such. A mobile or tablet doesn't support Flash, which means that you won't be able to fully enjoy the comic if you read it on that.
 Homestuck is filled with important details, and missing one could make you really confused. Write a few sentences for every 50 pages, then you'll understand it pretty well.
 There are several 'rules' to reading Homestuck. Don't skip the intermissions. Don't skip acts. Don't skip Pesterlogs. Don't give up, either, even when it seems incredibly dull. Details in Homestuck are everything, and as long and as useless as Act 1 may seem, it's ridiculously important! Keep your head up, though. It's very much worth the suffering.
 Most spoilers can be found on Tumblr, the MSPA wiki, YouTube, and all those websites where you can find Homestuck fans. Read the comic before approaching any of these places.
 Shipping is the idea of putting two characters into a relationship (non-canonically). A headcanon is an idea or opinion about a fictional series (book, TV, comic, or otherwise) that is true in one's head, but has not become a canon fact.
 Ever! No matter how useless or boring a part might seem, it is incredibly relevant. This applies to PesterLogs, Intermissions, comic links and the videos. The Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff comics are optional, but they're a short read and are referenced many times throughout the comic.
 You get the full experience when you are simultaneously listening to the epic tracks that will sometimes be on a couple pages of the comic.
 It's pretty crazy, but with determination, self-sacrifice, something to punch, and a nearby ambulance, you should be alright! Good luck!

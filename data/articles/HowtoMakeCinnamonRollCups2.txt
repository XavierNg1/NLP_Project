 Grease the inside of a 6-cup muffin pan with butter or nonstick cooking spray. You only need to grease 5 cups.


If you don't have a 6-cup muffin pan, you can use the 5 inner cups on a 12-cup muffin pan instead.
 You can do this using a hand-held beater, an electric mixer, or even a food processor.
 Keep beating the cream cheese until it everything is smooth and evenly combined. Set the cream cheese mixture aside when you are done., Open up the can of cinnamon rolls. Take one out and unwind it until the disk is wide enough to fit in the bottom of a muffin well. Cut off the excess cinnamon roll and set it aside.Save the packet of icing that came with the can.
You can also make cinnamon rolls from scratch instead.
 This will make the base of your cup. Unwrap the rest of the cinnamon rolls and set them into the bottom of each well. Save the scraps; you will be using them in a moment., Take one of the excess cinnamon roll strips. Form it into a ring and tuck it into one of the muffin wells. Press it against the sides to resemble a cup. Use your finger to smooth down the side seam on the walls of your cup.There may be some overlap at the seams, which is fine.
Repeat this step for the remaining scraps and muffin wells.
 You will use about1 1/2 tablespoons (cc grams) for each cinnamon roll cup., They are ready when they turn a light, golden brown color., Allow the cups to cool in the muffin pan for about 2 minutes. Run a thin knife around the inside edges of each well to loosen the cups, then pop them out., Open up the packet of icing that came with your cinnamon rolls. Drizzle it onto each cup while they are still hot.If you made cinnamon rolls from scratch, you will need to prepare some glace icing from scratch as well.
 They taste best while they are still warm. Be careful, however; the cream cheese will be hot!If you desire additional flavor, consider spooning some jam or preserves on top!

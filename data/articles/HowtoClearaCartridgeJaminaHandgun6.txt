 Is there an immediate need to continue firing, for instance, a self defense situation? If there is an urgent need to continue firing, then do so, but understand there may be risk involved.
 Use a pen light to examine the chamber, looking for fouling, rust, or other damage that could cause the cartridge case to hang up. Look at the shells to make sure they are the correct caliber and type for your firearm. There are numerous different 9mm cartridges available, like 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, and .380 Auto. These are not interchangeable. If you cannot ascertain you have the correct ammo, do not reload and fire your weapon.

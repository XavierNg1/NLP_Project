 Use a box grater to finely shred the cheddar. Shred the cheese right out of the refrigerator, since it shreds better when it’s cold. If it’s giving you trouble, place the cheddar in the freezer for 10-30 minutes to harden it. Then attempt to shred it again.


Feel free to use already-shredded cheddar for this. However, the cheddar usually has a better flavor if you grate it yourself from the block., After shredding it, allow the cheddar to reach room temperature before you apply heat. The outcome will be smoother and the cheese will require less heat to melt at room temperature. Pile the shredded cheese into a non-stick pot with ample room that can easily accommodate it.
 Put the pot of cheese over the lowest heat setting your stove will allow. Always melt cheese at the lowest heat possible.If you apply high heat to cheese, you risk losing the moisture and fat in the cheese, which results in lumpy or greasy cheese., Don’t leave cheese unattended on your stove, since it can melt and begin to burn very quickly. Stir the cheddar frequently to keep it moving around the pot. This will ensure the cheese is melted through evenly and prevent it from sticking to the pot and/or burning.
 Try not to melt the cheddar any longer than is necessary, since this can result in a rubbery consistency and effect the flavor. Once the cheese melts and reaches a string-like consistency, stir it once more and then remove it from the heat immediately.

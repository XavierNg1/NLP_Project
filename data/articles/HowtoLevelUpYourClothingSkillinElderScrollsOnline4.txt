 You can see if your currently equipped gear could use an improvement from your inventory as well. Hit the Start button and open your inventory to see your items. You can improve light and medium armor., You can either look at your map for a pair of scissors cutting thread, or simply look for a table in town that has hide stretched over it and leather scraps scattered over it., Walk up to the Clothing Station and hit the A button. This will open the clothing menu., Go down to the fourth option that says “Improvement” and hit the A button. A list of your current items will open on the left side of the page., Go to the item you want to improve and hit the A button., The type of Tannin you use will depend on the rarity of your current item. If you want to go from a white item to green, you will need hemming. Green to blue items require embroidery and blue to purple needs elegant lining. Finally, purple to orange requires dreugh wax., Do this by going left and right on your controller on the improvement tab.

The percentage of the improvement is based on how many Tannin you use. For instance, if you wanted to go from a white to green item, you can use between 1 and 5 hemmings. If you only use one, your improvement chance is going to only be 20%. If you fail, your item and the tannin will be destroyed. So your best bet is to always use the most Tannin per improvement that you can to get a 100% chance of succeeding.
 You will now have the item that you created (as long as it doesn’t fail) and will gain valuable Clothing experience.

 To take a rectal temperature, you'll need a multi-use digital thermometer or a rectal thermometer. The thermometer should have a flexible tip with a wide handle so you can easily insert it just a little into the baby's rectum. If you use a multi-use digital thermometer, designate it just for use in taking rectal temperatures. Get another digital thermometer if you plan on taking oral or axillary temperatures.Taking your baby's temperature rectally is one of the most accurate ways to check temperature, especially in babies from newborn age to three years old.
 Dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and rub it over the tip of the digital thermometer. You could also wash the tip in soap and water if you don't have rubbing alcohol. Rinse the soap away with cool water. Rub a little bit of petroleum jelly or lubricant on the end of the thermometer.Avoid rinsing the thermometer with hot water since this could cause inaccurate temperature readings.
 Lay your baby belly down across your lap or on a table. Keep your baby still by putting the palm of your hand against the baby's lower back near the bottom.If your baby squirms too much, try keeping your baby face up. Bend your baby's legs towards the chest so the bottom is exposed.
 Use your free hand to gently insert the thermometer into your baby's rectum. You should only insert it 1/2 inch to an inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm). Hold the thermometer in place while cupping your baby's bottom. Leave the thermometer in place until you hear a beep, signaling that the temperature was recorded. Remove the thermometer and write down the temperature.If you insert the thermometer more than an inch, you risk damaging your baby's rectum.

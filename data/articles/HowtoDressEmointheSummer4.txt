 Everyone looks more Emo with bold eyeliner, applied thickly around the entire rim of your eye. Charcoal is traditional, but it’s alright to experiment with green or blue in the summer. Get an eyeliner that’s long-lasting, all-day, or waterproof to make sure it stays in place through summer showers, swimming, and sweat., Short shag and bobs are well within the Emo style-book. Fortunately, short ’dos also keep you cool in the summer., If you want your hair to say Emo regardless of what you’re wearing, try clipping some bangs. The most appropriate styles are blunt or shaggy bangs that graze your eyebrows or baby bangs for a short, blunt fringe., If you haven’t already, give this Emo look for your tresses a go. Jet black is the most traditional color, but contemporary Emo kids are expanding the style palate with bleached and rainbow-colored looks.You don’t have to necessarily dye your entire mane. If you have light hair, try dark lowlights for an emo accent. If you have dark hair, accent it with bleached chunks or a two-toned look.
Add drama with bold-colored streaks in pink, purple, or blue.
 The virtue of summer clothing is that it’s a great excuse to display any skin art you may have. Take advantage of the heat to exhibit the inked armband that would otherwise be hidden by long sleeves.If you have a tattoos on your calves, wear some shorts. If you have one on your chest, wear a v-neck.

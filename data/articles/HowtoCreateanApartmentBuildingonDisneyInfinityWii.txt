 This will allow you to create the building. Do this by pressing the + button on your Wii remote. This will not be possible in the toybox launch.
 Lay down large floors as a base. If you are in the platforming toybox, you can even add automatic double doors! This floor will become your lobby. Make a desk from blocks and add some plants., These walls are doubled, so we can add some wallpaper. Take some large walls and build them against the floor. Make another layer of walls outside of that. Be sure to add a small space in the walls., Place an elevating platform outside of the space. Be sure to surround the shaft with walls, and put a small floor under it., Do the same thing as in the first floor, and be aware of elevators. When you do the basic steps, place some walls on the center of the floors (doubled). These will divide the rooms. You could even place decorations outside the doors like in a real apartment!, Equip your magic wand, and color the inside of your walls. Next make some furniture however you like!, Make an elevator shaft going up to the roofs. This roof can have benches, verandas, gardens, recreation equipment, whatever you want! Use whatever terrain, blocks, and plants you want to make the rooftop gardens of your dreams!, Congrats! You just made your own luxurious apartment in the Disney Infinity toybox!

 If you are creating a QR code for your personal website or as your contact card, you can use a free QR code generator. These services will create a QR code for you, but don’t provide any advanced tracking or analytics.


The most popular free code generator is GoQR.me.
There are apps available for iPhone and Android that allow you to create QR codes as well.;
, Most free generators will have several format options available. These might include simple text, a website URL, a phone number, a text message, or a vCard (contact card). The device that scans the code will launch the applicable program when the code is scanned (for example, scanning a phone number code will open the dialer on the phone and enter in the phone number).
 Enter your data into the fields provided by the generator. If you are entering text or a URL, try to keep it under 300 characters. Older phones and devices have difficulty with codes larger than 300 characters.
 By default, QR codes are black and white, but they can actually be any color you want. Most free code generators will allow you to adjust the colors on your QR code. This may be located in the “Options” or “Color” section of the generator.


Some free generators allow you to change the size of the code, while others require a subscription in order to perform this service.
 All free code generators allow you to download your code in PNG format. This image file can be easily added to any document, uploaded to your personal website, or even added to your email signature.


Some services, such as GoQR, provide an embedding code that you can use for your website.

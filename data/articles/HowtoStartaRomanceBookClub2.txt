 If your group is small enough and your members are comfortable enough with each other, you can meet in your homes. As the groupâ€™s leader, you can either hold each meeting in your own home or ask if anyone else would be willing to take turns hosting. No one should feel pressured into hosting, however.
 Choose a public place that offers some level of privacy; otherwise, the shyest of your members may not feel comfortable voicing her ideas and opinions on the intimate details. Think library conference rooms, restaurants with secluded seating, and sparsely populated parks.
 You can set up a small forum, chat room, blog, social media group, or e-mail group. This may make it difficult for any members who are not technologically adept, but this option also allows you to meet with members from virtually any geographic location. Plus, you never need to worry about needing to cancel a meeting due to bad weather or construction.
 If you only want to meet whenever you finish a book, you may want to schedule your meetings on a monthly basis. If you want to meet periodically to discuss the book in the midst of reading it, schedule meetings on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.
 The biggest, most obvious rules are to show up and to read the book. You may not need to set up any official rules outside of that unless problems arise between members later on.
 Will you consistently lead discussions, or should each member take a turn? Should you come up with a list of discussion questions to cover, or would members be better off saying whatever is on their mind? It may take you a few meetings before you can figure out what discussion format works best for your group.
 Reading about romance may make the members of your group want to talk about their own love lives, but doing so in the midst of book club takes away from valuable discussion time. Instruct members who want to socialize to meet a little beforehand, or invite them to stay past your scheduled book club time.

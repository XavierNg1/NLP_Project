 That is the most important step! If you are rude then people tend to dislike you.;
, Find the way you are alike. And don't try to like everything they like. Let's say the you said you don't like chocolate and then the person you want to be your friend is like: I love chocolate! Then don't say: actually I like chocolate too. Just admit that's a way you are not a like. If you you try to like everything they like you might eventually come across as annoying.
 Talk to them and socialize. If you never pay attention then they will find you boring!

,, Talk about the thing you have agreed about, both like, or is funny. It's more healthy then always gossiping about someone.
 Give your friends space.
 Care for your friend! If you never show interest she/he will feel neglected and walk away.

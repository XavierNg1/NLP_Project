 If the wedding reception is at night, you will need to add outdoor lighting to the event space. Depending on the location of the reception, you may not have access to electricity. If electricity is not available on site, consider renting a generator to plug in electric lights, or rely on candles and battery-operated lighting sources.


Provide lighting through flaming tiki torches. Situate tiki torches around the perimeter of your event space. Be sure the tiki torches are not near anything flammable.
Utilize twinkle lights to illuminate your space. String twinkle lights overhead, along the perimeters of the reception space or on the tables to add a warm glow to your reception.
Place candles inside tall hurricane glasses throughout the reception. You can use the candles on guest tables, buffets, cake table, bar and other sturdy surfaces.

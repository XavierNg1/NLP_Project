 Once you've figured out where to focus your energies, sit down with a calendar or planner and set some goals. Figure out when you can reasonably get things done by.Setting deadlines for yourself will help you track your progress and keep you accountable to yourself.
 Next, establish a set period of time each day that you will dedicate to catching up on your work. Stick to this plan, every day.The amount of extra school work time you will need to set aside will depend on how much you need to get done. In some cases, an extra hour a day might be enough, but in others you may need to set aside much more time.
To succeed, be aware that you will probably have to step back from some of your other activities, at least temporarily. You may need, for example to spend less time with your friends, stop going to club meetings for a while, skip a few piano lessons or soccer games, or even withdraw from certain time-intensive activities entirely.
 Once you have a plan, stick to it. Work every day to make progress on your school work.


If you are having trouble staying focused on your work during long work sessions, try building some short breaks into the schedule. This can help boost your productivity and creative thinking.Getting a little extra exercise can also help you stay focused.
During work times, turn off your phone if you can, log out of social media, and make sure there aren't other distractions around such as a TV on.
Having a well organized work space that is free of clutter and distractions can also help.

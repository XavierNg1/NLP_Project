 Several conditions that occur before, during, or after delivery can result in the precipitation of PPH. Some of these conditions require close monitoring of the woman during and after delivery to rule out PPH. It is important to know about these conditions, as they increase a woman's chances of suffering from this condition.


Placenta Previa, placental abruption, retained placenta, and other placental abnormalities

Pre-eclampsia or increased blood pressure during pregnancy
History of PPH in a previous delivery
Obesity
Uterine abnormalities
Anemia

Bleeding during pregnancy
Long lasting labour more than 12 hours
Baby’s birth weight above 4 kgs;
, Postpartum hemorrhage, or blood loss after giving birth, is one of the world’s leading causes of maternal death, even after safe delivery. There are several reasons why excessive bleeding of more than 500 ml after delivery of the baby occurs. One of this is called uterine atony.


Uterine atony is when the uterus of the mother (the part of the female reproductive system that housed the baby) is having difficulties in going back to its original state.
The uterus remains lose, hollow and non-contracting when it should be firm and contracting. This makes the passage of blood easier and faster, contributing to postpartum hemorrhage.
 Another reason why excessive bleeding occurs is when trauma or injury occurs as the baby exits the body.


Trauma may be in the form of cuts, which can be caused by using assistive devices during delivery
Alternatively, lacerations can occur when the baby is larger than average and is coming out rapidly. This may cause a tear in the vaginal opening.
 Bleeding caused by PPH will not always flow out of the body. At times, bleeding occurs internally and if there’s no outlet for the blood it will move toward the small crevices found in between bodily tissues and will form what is called a haematoma.

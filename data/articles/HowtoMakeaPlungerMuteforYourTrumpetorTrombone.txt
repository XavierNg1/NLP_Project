 Don't buy one that is too big. If you can't find one that will cover the entire trumpet bell, you can settle for a smaller one, but these will not give you as good of a sound.

(Optional) Take a nickel and stick it in the hole that you just cut. Make sure it is all the way in and won't come out and become lodged into your trumpet/trombone.
Also make sure that you stick it in so that it's not closing up the hole, but so it is like a wall in the middle of it. This will give your plunger more of a buzzing sound.

 Be advised that some frozen fruit, such as blueberries, might "bleed" the color through the baked item while it bakes, while fresh fruit may enhance any crispness or taste in each bite, such as by adding of cooking/tart apples.;
, Dried cranberries are an excellent substitution for blueberries or any fresh fruit and add some crunchiness to any muffin. If a recipe calls for a cup of fruit, substitute dried cranberries for 1/2 cup of dried fruit. Plump them up in size by placing them in juice or hot water in advance.
 For example, for Jiffy Blueberry muffins, take out the "fake" blueberry bits. Add a handful of frozen or fresh blueberries. Keep the rest of the recipe the same.

 The urge to ogle isn’t a force of nature you can’t fight. It can feel that way because the invitation to look at other people is so ingrained in the movies, tv shows, and magazines that are available. But the sooner you acknowledge that ogling is something you can stop doing, the sooner you can work to not do it!, This includes looking at magazines, watching movies and TV shows, etc, for the sole purpose of ogling the people you see there. If you’re doing it at home/from afar, you’re more likely to do it in person, too., Breaking bad habits can take up to 28 days. If you falter while you're trying to break the habit, don't get too down on yourself. Keep trying, and you just might be able to break the habit.

 If you’re already out on the town, and you realize you have camel toe, a quick fix is to wear a panty liner. Many beauty pageant contestants use this trick.Instead of wearing the panty liner vertically like you normally would, fasten it to your underwear horizontally, and place it around the seat of your underwear.
You can think of this maneuver as applying the panty liner as if it is a Band-aid.
 This seems like the simplest solution, but it’s only a quick fix because the camel toe could come back.

However, in the restroom or a private area, simply tug at the material so that it loosens around your private area.
You could also pull your pants down a notch at the waist to reduce the tightness around your crotch area. If all else fails, tie a sweater around your waist.
 Whenever a problem arises in society, people invent a solution to it. Camel toe is no different.


You can also buy commercial inserts that resemble panty liners but are specifically designed to prevent cameltoe. Camel Ammo and Camelflage are two such brands.You can purchase special panties designed to prevent camel toe, especially online. Some of the panties are designed out of special materials that won’t bunch. Some of them have a triangular patch sewn into the area of your privates.You can also find commercial camel toe guards that resemble men’s athletic cups. Some of these products are flesh colored. Look for them online.
 If you don't have a panty liner handy, you could cut out a small piece of card stock and create your own panty liner out of it.


You will use it vertically. Cut it to the approximate size of the crotch section of your panties.
Then, layer the piece of cardstock underneath the panty liner. Wrap the wings around the bottom of the crotch of your underwear and smooth them down. The extra cardstock should work as a cup to keep everything hidden.

 Arrange a few sticks in somewhat half a tee pee. Use 2 more sticks to hold up the "tee pee", similar to your shelter. Place an item of your choice you think an animal will come after. If you're lucky, the animal will be trapped., Dig a hole in the ground about 2-3m deep and 1-2m across (depends on the prey size). Take 2 thin branches and place them criss-crossed across the hole. Cover it with leaves and put something the animals like to eat. You can also put a few wooden spikes sharpened by your knife at the bottom. Don't forget to build a ladder or you might not be able to climb out of the hole. Always remember to cut it up into smaller pieces before moving it out of the hole. The last thing you want to do is to injure yourself. Set as many traps as you can.,,, NEVER eat white berries. It may be tempting to eat regular grass, but do not.

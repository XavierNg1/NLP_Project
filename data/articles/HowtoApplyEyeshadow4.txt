 Create your base color by using a stiff flat brush to pat on your medium color over the entirety of your eyelid. If you want, you can also add a tiny smudge of your highlighter shade to the inner corner of your eyes or just below your brow to brighten up your face a bit.
 Use your pencil brush and your darkest color to darken your crease. Sweep the dark color back and forth across your entire crease to darken it and make your eyes appear more deep set. You can choose to create a regular banana - with the shadow only on the crease - or a closed-crease banana with the shadow running down to meet your lash line. Keep the shadow in a relatively thin line across your lid.
 Clean your pencil brush well with an antibacterial brush cleaner or soap and water, and dry it with a clean cloth. Because you want your crease to stay pretty dark, use this brush to slightly blur the outer edges. Donâ€™t blend the color too much, so your lid is completely highlighted.

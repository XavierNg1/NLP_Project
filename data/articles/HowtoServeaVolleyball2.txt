 They should be shoulder width apart, with your non dominant foot leading.


Have your feet and body facing directly where you plan on serving the ball. This will line up your body, giving you the most power in your serve.
Your weight should be resting on your back foot.
 You will hold the ball up with your secondary hand - the one you don’t write with. This is also called your shelf hand.
 You will use your shelf hand to lift the ball above your head, tossing it 12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) up.


Release the ball near eye-level or when your arm is fully extended.
Be sure to throw the ball straight up, as throwing to the side will force you to have to reach and make your hit out of balance.
Don’t try to throw the ball per se, but rather lift it into the air in a pushing motion. This will help to prevent a throw that is too high.
Prepare to hit the ball. Bring your hitting elbow back so that it is held in the air just above your ear.Imagine pulling a bow-and-arrow string as you reach back to hit the ball. This is about how your elbow should be bent before the hit.
When the ball hits its highest point, swing forward to hit it. Use the torque from your arm and torso to add strength to your hit.
 Keep your hand open and hit with the heel of your palm, or close it in a half-fist.


Use a punching action to hit it, stopping your swing just after you make contact with the ball.
Unlike an underhand serve, you will have little to no follow through after you hit the ball.
Push forward with your hand to hit the ball with little to no spin, as is desired for a floating serve.

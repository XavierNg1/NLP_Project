 Regardless of where you decide your dog will sleep, it is important that you establish a set place for sleeping. Once you decide on a space, place your dog’s crate or bed in it. You should keep the space consistent and avoid changing the location of your dog’s sleeping space unless it is necessary.
 While many dogs can adapt to living and sleeping outside, there are definite risks such as extreme weather than can cause the dog harm. If you do make your dog sleep outside, make sure it has a doghouse that is well insulated and at least 2-3 inches taller than the dog. The dog house should be well protected from the wind and elements, with the door facing east or south, and contain weatherproof bedding., This is a great option for pet owners who want to be close to their dogs, but aren’t keen on sharing a bed with them. Place your dog’s bed or crate in your bedroom, perhaps near the foot of your bed or beside your bed. This will help both you and the dog get a good night’s sleep.
 While humans have the luxury of piling on extra blankets if they get cold while sleeping, your dog does not. For this reason, it is important to place your dog’s bed, pad, or crate in a warm place. This will allow your dog to sleep comfortably and potentially avoid nighttime antics generated from an inability to sleep comfortably., This is especially important for puppies or older dogs that bark when they encounter distractions like noises. Place your dog’s bed, pad, or crate in a quiet spot in the house that will be free from distractions. This will help your dog get a good night’s sleep, and prevent your dog from interrupting your sleep when it is distracted.

 For this modern updo, you're using the clip to create a pile of curls on top of your head. The clip won't be visible, and your curls will pile in the shape of a Rihanna-style fauxhawk. Awesome, right? If you don't already have curly hair, go ahead and curl it up.Tight ringlets look great with this style and will stay in place better.
If you don't want to use a curling iron or hot rollers, curl your hair without heat using a t-shirt or make pin curls. You'll need to start the night before with wet hair.
 Get the clip ready by unsnapping it at the top and opening it wide.
 Gather your hair tightly at the very top of your head, where you'd place a topknot. Use a comb to make sure the sides and back are smooth, with all the curls piled on top. Hold your hair in place with one hand.
 Use your other hand to place the clip in your hair. The hinge of the clip should hit toward the peak of your skull. Make sure the clip curves along your head, rather than pointing out.
 Close the clip close against your head to gather your hair in place, then snap it shut at the top. The tip of the clip should land an inch or two back from your forehead.
 Arrange your curls around the clip so the ends fall on either side of it to hide it from view. Use bobby pins to secure the curls in place to keep the clip hidden. Finish the look with hairspray.

Arriving too early will only give the hotel management a sense of rush to get the room ready, and defeat your chances of upgrading to better digs.
Arriving later can also be a benefit if the hotel needs your standard room before you get there. Let the management know you’ll be arriving late so you don’t loose your room. At the same time, tell them you would be happy with an upgraded room if they end up needing your standard room.

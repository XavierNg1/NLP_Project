 Plan out your prank and what you want to say before you make the call. If you don’t sound sure of yourself when the victim answers, or if you stutter or hesitate, you’ll give yourself away. At the very least, have your opening line prepared.


If you are planning an elaborate prank, script it out before you call.
 Long prank calls are hard to pull off, and the longer you have the other person on the line, the more suspicious they become. Keep your pranks short, sweet and silly. 5 minutes or less is a good goal for the length of a prank call.
 Calling the same person over and over, no matter how hilarious it is to you, is harassment. If your victim feels harassed, the police will get involved and you’ll be caught.


Try to keep your pranks limited to one call per victim, or at the most, two.
Prank them, laugh, and move on from that phone number forever., Find your phone’s mute button and if you absolutely have to laugh, use it. Laughing at the very beginning of the call will give you away immediately, so try to hold it together. It’s okay to start laughing at the end, when the prank is starting to disintegrate and becoming obvious to the other person.


In fact, giggling at the end can actually benefit you, since it will show the person that it was just a harmless prank and not a big deal.
 Serious pranks that upset other people are usually not very funny at all. They also escalate your chances of being caught by stressing your victim out so much that they feel the need to call the police. Keeping your prank calls on the silly side not only protects you from getting in trouble, but the calls are more fun to make and usually funnier, too.


Try to craft your pranks so that, by the end, the other person is laughing with you.
Occasionally your victim will outfox you and call you out on your prank, and then both of you will get a good laugh. Don’t take yourself too seriously!

 The resistor should be precise to within 1 percent or less. Wiring in series forces the current to pass through the resistor as well as the inductor being tested; the resistor and inductor should have 1 terminal touching.
 This is done with a function generator, which simulates currents the inductor and resistor would receive in actual use.
 Adjust the frequency until the junction voltage where the inductor and resistor meet is half of the input voltage.
 This is measured in kilohertz.
 Unlike calculating inductance from voltage and current, setting up the test is easier, but the math is more complicated. It breaks down as follows:


Multiply the resistance of the resistor by the square root of 3. If the resistor has a resistance of 100 ohms, multiplying by 1.73 (the square root of 3 to 2 decimal places), this value is 173.
Divide the result by the product of 2 times pi times the frequency. For a frequency of 20 kilohertz, 2 times 3.14 (pi to 2 decimal places) times 20 is 125.6; 173 divided by 125.6 equals, to 2 decimal places, 1.38 millihenries.
mH = (R x 1.73) / (6.28 x (Hz / 1000))
Example: given R = 100 and Hz = 20,000
mH = (100 X 1.73) / (6.28 x (20,000 / 1000)
mH = 173 / (6.28 x 20)
mH = 173 / 125.6
mH = 1.38

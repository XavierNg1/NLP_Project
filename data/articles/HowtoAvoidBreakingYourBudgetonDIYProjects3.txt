 If you're building something that requires things like digging or working outdoors, review your city's regulations. You may be unable to build or dig in certain areas due to things like utility lines. You don't want to spend a lot of money on a project only to find out it's not possible to complete., If you've never done a project before, consult an expert. Ask someone at the hardware store or call up a friend with experience in DIY projects. You need to understand the full process before embarking on a project. An expert can also give you tips on where and how you can save money on supplies., If you can't find someone to lend you a tool, you don't have to buy it. See if there's a local hardware store that rents out tools. It will be much cheaper to rent a tool you need for a day than to buy one, especially if you're likely to only use the tool a single time.

 Some forms of RA result in ulcers that need to be protected. Dress the wound with bandages, pads or gauze to prevent infections entering the wounds. Change these dressings every day and after showering.


Your doctor may advise you to use a topical steroid cream under the dressing to reduce inflammation and/or pain. Discuss with your doctor on the appropriate cream to apply.
 Your doctor may advise you to receive a steroid injection within the wound with the steroid Triamcinolone 40 mg/ml into the ulcer edge, either alone or as additional therapy.Your doctor will first clean around the injection site with alcohol pads. After the injection, he may advise dressing the wound including the site of injection to prevent infection.
 Oral steroids are the mainstay therapy for this condition, Prednisolone is the drug of choice and is usually started at high doses (60-120 mg) tapered down to lower doses.Discuss with your doctor to establish what the starting dose should be and how long you should be on a certain dose of oral steroids before reducing the dose.


Side effects of steroid use include increased blood sugar, weight gain, infections due to lower immunity (these drugs reduce the immune systemâ€™s inflammatory response), swelling, bruising and much more.It is not advised to stay on steroids for extended periods of time. Talk to your doctor to establish a timeline on when to stop using steroids.
 Cyclosporin is an immunosuppressive drug that can be used to reduce the dependence on steroids and, secondly, used as an alternative treatment if steroids fail to work. Your doctor will determine if you should try Cyclosporin. Then he will give you a prescription and proper dosing based on your weight. This drug can be taken as a capsule, liquid or injection; take as directed.
Most patients show clinical improvement within three weeks with a dose of 3-5 mg/kg/day.

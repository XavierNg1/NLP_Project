The rise is the height of porch, or the steps, that you will need.
A run is the total length of the steps from the edge of the porch to where the steps end.
Stringers are usually 2 x 12-inch (5.1 x 30.5 cm) treated wood boards to which the tread and riser are attached.
The treads are 2 x 6-inch (5.1 x 15.2 cm) treated or composite wood boards that lay parallel to each other to form a single step that is approximately 10.5 inches (26.7 cm) wide.
You will attach a riser, a 1 x 8-inch (2.5 X 20.3 cm) board, resembling a toe board, to the back or upright section of the step. Most steps are 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) in height.;

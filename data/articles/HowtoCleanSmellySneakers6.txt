 For inexpensive shoes or shoes almost beyond hope, put them in the washer and wash with towels. Add OxiClean or other non-chlorine additive to the soap to help sanitize. Air dry or dry on low heat.


If you were going to throw them away anyway, it's worth the effort. They may seem tight the first time you put them back on but will stretch into shape quickly.

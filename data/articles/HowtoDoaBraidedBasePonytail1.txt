 This style looks best with a mid-height ponytail, but you can do a high ponytail or a low one as well.








If you want to fluff out your ponytail, do so now.;
, Gather the hair from underside of your ponytail, right next to the hair tie. It should be about the thickness of your finger.








Consider coloring the strand with hair chalk. Be sure to set the color with a flat iron!

, You do not need to tie it off, because you will eventually be pinning it in place.
 Wrap the braid so that it covers the hair tie completely. Try to finish you wrapping with the end of the braid underneath the ponytail.
 Pry open a bobby pin, and slide it up through the base of your ponytail, catching the end of the braid as you do so. If you need to, secure the braid with more bobby pins on the top and both sides of the ponytail.








Be sure to use bobby pins that match your hair color.

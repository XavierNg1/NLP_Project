 Use a large mixing bowl. Pour in a ½ cup of water (118 ml). Add 1 tablespoon of active dry yeast. Stir until the yeast dissolves., First, use your microwave or stovetop to melt a ½ cup of butter (118 ml). Then, in a second mixing bowl, add the butter, 2 cups of milk (473 ml), and 1 teaspoon of salt. For sweeter waffles, also add 2 tablespoons of sugar if desired. Stir until the ingredients are evenly mixed., First, allow the second bowl’s contents to cool down until it is lukewarm at most. Then pour them into the first bowl with the yeast and water. Stir until they have combined evenly., Once the two liquid mixtures have been combined, add 3 cups of all-purpose flours (384 g). Mix the flour vigorously to form a dough. Continue until no dry flour remains., Seal the bowl with an airtight lid or plastic wrap. Then let it sit as is overnight. Expect the dough to double or triple in size during that time., Once the dough has risen, beat or whisk two eggs until their consistency is even. Pour these into the batter, then add a ½ teaspoon of baking soda. Whisk or beat them the new ingredients into the dough until they have mixed evenly., Line the inside of your waffle iron with a thin layer of vegetable oil to keep your batter from waffles from sticking. Then preheat the iron to its optimum temperature.Scoop an eighth of your dough into the iron for each waffle. Cook for about four minutes.Waffle irons’ temperatures may differ from one model to the next. Add or subtract minutes as needed.

 Use cold water to flush out as much of the stain as possible. Many of the pigments in pollen are composed of fats and respond best to cold water for removal.Therefore, avoid using hot water before pretreating the stain, as it may further set it and make it more difficult to remove later., You can use an enzyme cleaner, traditional laundry spot cleaner, or a small amount of dishwashing liquid. Any of these pretreatment solutions should be adequate for stain removal. Gently work the pretreatment solution of your choice into the stain and allow it to sit for at least 20 minutes before washing.Before pretreating, test the solution on an inconspicuous area to test for color-fastness.
Enzyme cleaners work by breaking down biological substances (such as the fat in pollen pigment) and thus generally work best for this type of stain., Use your normal detergent on the hottest setting that the fabric will allow (check the tags of the garment for washing instructions). For stubborn stains, use an enzyme-based detergent and wash in warm water; this type of detergent works best with warm, but not hot, water.

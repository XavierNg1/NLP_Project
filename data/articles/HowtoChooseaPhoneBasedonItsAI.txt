Siri uses the Bing mapping system and the results are clear and easy to understand.
Cortana uses Bing maps for navigation and presents the map in an easy to follow format

, Small screens mean the data is sometimes hard to read and having it read may be better for you.


Google Now has access to all the info found on Google because, well it is a Google product.
Siri uses Bing for her web searching and train/airport info, and can say the data so you don't need to look at your phone..
Cortana relies on Bing for searching as well so her results would follow those of Bing. She can also say the data out loud.



Google now doesn't have a character at all and is basically an audible version of Google.
Siri is a bit astute, formal and "addicted" to her job. She will give you your info with just a tad of humor sometimes.
Cortana is midway between Google and Siri in that she has a personality that isn't stiff like Siri, plus she has Bing as her backbone and a video game namesake, so she has info and wit.

 Make sure you use a pot that can accommodate the amount of corn you plan to boil.









Add a little sugar to the water if you want to sweeten your corn while it cooks. Never add salt to the water you use to boil corn on the cob. Salt will make the corn tough.

Cover the pot while you wait for the water and corn to boil. This will help the water heat faster and it will also contain the corn, which tends to float to the top of the pot.
 This usually takes from 3 to 4 minutes, depending on the size of your pot.









Resist the temptation to let the corn sit in the boiling water for a while. This will result in overcooked corn. You want your corn on the cob to be crisp and tender, not soft and mushy.
Allow the corn to boil for up to 10 minutes if you prefer a soft corn. People with dental issues might prefer corn that is more pliable and easy to chew.

 This will serve as the body. For this tutorial the frog is facing upwards and to the left, but your frog can go in whatever direction you'd like--just make sure all its features are in accordance with that.;
, These should be in the upper left part of the oval, with one slightly hidden behind the protuberance of the frog's face.
 For the left leg, draw a long horizontal oval overlapping a long vertical oval, then put a circle under the vertical flat oval. On the circle draw four small flat ovals on the circle. For the right leg, draw only the frog's hand.
 The back legs should, of course, be longer, but otherwise the structure is identical.
 Erase unnecessary marks and add details. Make sure to draw a long mouth and a thin pupil inside the left eye.
 For a realistic depiction use light green and yellow for the back and and limbs, a very light green for the belly, orange for the paws, and red for the eyes. Add blue thick stripes to the limbs and body, and there you go, you're done!

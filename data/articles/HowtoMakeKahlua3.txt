 Don't feel like scrolling up? That was 2 cups of water, 4 cups of sugar, and 3/4 cup instant coffee crystals. Keep stirring until everything dissolves and is one uniform, smooth consistency.


If you're worried about your insta-Kahlua being a little lacking (generally the ones that take more time have a bit more flavor), you could consider adding a few cocoa nibs to give it a tang of chocolate to make the flavor more dynamic., Once everything has dissolved, take it off the heat and let the mixture cool to room temperature. This should take 15-20 minutes. A thermometer works well for this, but you could always take taste tests instead to find out!

, When the concoction reaches room temperature, add 2 1/4 cups of vodka (average quality is best), 2 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and stir well. Bingo â€“ your homemade coffee liqueur is made and ready for consumption.


If your guests aren't going to go hog wild over it at the pot, pour the mixture into bottles (three 12 oz. bottles works well) to keep for later. But do know that this recipe is supposed to be enjoyed immediately, so take advantage of not having to wait 2 weeks for infusion!

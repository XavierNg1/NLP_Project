 In order to achieve your goals, you must make sure that they are smart, realistic, and measurable goals. Setting goals for yourself will keep you motivated without the need for an adult to tell you what to do. You will build self-esteem and confidence as you achieve your goals.Try setting small, achievable goals for yourself to gain confidence and a sense of accomplishment. For example, you might set a goal to finish a paper for your English class. Or, you might set a goal to learn how to play a new song on the piano.
 Once you have made a commitment to something or someone, it is important to follow through with that commitment. It is a sign of maturity if you can follow through with that commitment without having to be nagged and reminded by your parents. These commitments could be short term, like babysitting for a neighbor next Saturday, or they could be long term, like being elected class president.Maintain a planner or calendar to help keep track of your commitments.
 Children are often dependent on their parents to tell them what to do. As you grow up and become more mature, you should be able to be more proactive. Doing things like finishing your homework or keeping your room clean without being told is a sign that you are maturing. Adults must proactively do things each day in order to be successful.

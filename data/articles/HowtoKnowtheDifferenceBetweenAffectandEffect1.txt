 “Affect” means to make a change in something. Another way of looking at is it influences objects or things. It comes from a Latin word meaning “acted upon.”;
, Most of the time, “affect” is used as a verb. A verb is the action in a sentence. The subject (a noun or pronoun) does the action. So someone or something (the noun) is affecting (the verb) something else.
 Consider something that changes or influences something else. You could talk about rain changing water levels or a well-written novel moving someone. Sentences that properly use the word “affect” and address these topics include:


“The heavy rain affected the water levels in the local lake.”
“The tense, detailed writing affected him, moving him to tears.”

, When “affect” is used as a noun, it generally describes a person’s facial expressions. Examples include:


”The murderer took the news of the jury’s decision with little affect.”

 Her friends may have no idea what size she wears, but it is certainly worth a shot. You’ll probably have to tell them why you’re asking, so be prepared with a story if you don’t feel comfortable telling them the truth.You could also ask one of her friends to take her ring shopping. It is less likely to arouse suspicion if a close girlfriend casually suggests wanting to go ring shopping. Ask her friend to remember what size she wears after they go and report back to you.
If you want to get her a ring, but aren’t sure what she would like, this can also be a good way to get an idea of what styles she likes.;
, If you have a friend that is similar in size to your girlfriend, try asking them what size ring they wear. If you have already bought the ring, ask your friend to try it on and see if it fits.Keep in mind, though, that ring size can vary a lot. Even some petite girls can have chubby fingers, whereas some larger women have very slender fingers. Don’t just ask a friend that is roughly the same size and weight. Try to have a good idea of the recipient’s hand size, and then choose a friend that has similarly sized hands.
 You could come up with a story about how you’d like to get a family member (e.g. mom, sister, aunt, grandma, etc.) a ring as a gift, but that you have no idea what size they wear. Tell her that you think that she might have similarly sized hands, and ask if she knows what size ring she wears.You can take this one step further and actually purchase a cheap ring in the size you think she wears. Tell her you’re thinking of giving it to a female family member as a gift, but you’re not sure if the size is right. Have her try the ring on to see if it fits.

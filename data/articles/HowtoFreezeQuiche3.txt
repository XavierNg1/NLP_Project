 Bake the quiche as directed, but place it on a baking sheet before doing so. When you finish baking it, transfer the tray to the freezer, and let the quiche freeze until the soft center is frozen as hard as ice.


Even though the quiche is technically solid after it bakes, the filling is still quite soft. Letting it tray freeze before going into long-term freezer storage can prevent the soft filling from getting damaged in the freezer.
 Use a layer of plastic wrap and a layer of aluminum foil to wrap up the pre-frozen quiche, making sure that all the edges are thoroughly sealed to prevent excess exposure to the air.


If necessary, you can also place the quiche in a large plastic freezer bag for an even more airtight seal.
Label the quiche with the current date and the contents of the dish. This will allow you to keep track of how long the quiche has been in the freezer.
 Keep the quiche in its pie dish and place it in the freezer, keeping it at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) until you are ready to serve it.


Baked quiche can be frozen for two to three months, if necessary, without the quality being negatively affected., Do not thaw the quiche before you warm it up. Pull it out of the freezer and transfer it to an oven preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius). Let it bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it has completely warmed through.It is recommended that you do not thaw the quiche before warming it. Thawing it first can make the crust get moist and soggy.

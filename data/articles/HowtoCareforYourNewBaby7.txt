 You will need to get a car seat before your baby is born, as one will be necessary to take your new baby home. Be sure to always use a car seat which is appropriate for the age and weight of your child. Rear-facing car seats are the safest and should be used until your child is at least 1 year old.
 You will want a method to carry your baby while you are shopping or out walking around. You can get a stroller and push them or, if you want to save space, carry your baby in a carrying wrap. These are perfectly comfortable for both of you and will also help you bond.
 Newborns have very weak immune systems and should be exposed to as little illness as possible. Do not take them to very crowded or dirty places, avoid other childrenâ€™s birthday parties, and encourage others to touch the baby only on their feet (rather than the face or hands) to keep illness from spreading.

 Water distorts the position of underwater objects, making the fish seem closer than it actually is.Warm up your perception abilities by taking some practice stabs at rocks and debris to make sure you understand how much you must alter your aim to account for this discrepancy.
 Be aware that you will only get one opportunity to spear the fish successfully.

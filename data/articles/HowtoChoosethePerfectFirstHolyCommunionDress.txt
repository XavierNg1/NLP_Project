 Communion season is in the spring, so mid-winter (December and January) are the best times to start shopping. You’ll have the most selection and won’t be scrambling to find the right dress at the last minute.;
, While there are no set rules for communion dresses, the general rules are that dresses should be white and modest. Individual parishes often have their own set of rule, so be sure to check with yours before you go shopping.
 You might want to include a family symbol into embroidery, or a flower that’s special to your family.
 Getting on the same page with each other will help you avoid conflict during a shopping trip. Share the rules with her so she knows what is expected, and listen to her ideas. This will help you narrow in on the right dress when you go shopping, too.
 Communion dresses aren’t sized like other little girl’s clothing, so you’ll need to have her measurements to make sure you are getting a dress that fits perfectly.
 If you choose a sleeveless dress, some churches will require your little girl to wear a bolero or stole. Find one that matches her dress and that she can wear comfortably throughout the ceremony. A small purse is a great idea so your daughter has somewhere to store small items on her big day.
 While the requirement for a head covering has been lifted by the church, it is still an element that can add to the deep meaning of the event. Make sure the veil is an appropriate length and won’t trip your child when she walks.
 It can be easy to get carried away looking at the beautiful dresses available for your little girl, so make sure you know what you can spend and then avoid looking at dresses outside of that range.
 Whether it’s online or in person, find a store that has a great reputation. Ask friends and family about their suggestions, and choose a store that offers great customer service.

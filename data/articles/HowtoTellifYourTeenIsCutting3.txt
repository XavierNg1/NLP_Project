 It’s hard to accept, but the decision to cut or not to cut is your child’s alone. Someone who wants to self-injure will always find a way to do so. Instead of trying to control your child, focus on supporting them and helping them get to a better state of mind.You may still want to lock up razors and knives, but be aware that you probably can’t get rid of every sharp object in the house.
 Make an appointment with a medical professional, like your teen’s pediatrician. They can evaluate your teen’s health and refer you to a therapist or psychologist for treatment., Tell your child how talking with a therapist will help them deal with their emotions and feel better. Take a positive, casual tone. Don’t talk about therapy like a kind of punishment or make your child feel guilty for needing it.If you’ve ever been to see a therapist yourself, tell your teen about it. This will help normalize the idea for them.
 Sit down with your child and brainstorm some ways they can deal with their negative feelings instead of cutting. Offer to provide practical or emotional support however you can.For instance, offer to take a walk with your teen when they need to talk about a problem, or cut back on their household chores if they’re overwhelmed with schoolwork.

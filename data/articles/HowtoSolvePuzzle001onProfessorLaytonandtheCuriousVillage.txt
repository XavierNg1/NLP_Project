 Professor Layton will hand Luke a map.;
, They will say:


"My village is on a road that leads to no other towns. I look forward to seeing you there. Use your stylus to draw a circle around the right village, and then touch submit."

, If you are a little stumped, read the three hints:



Hint 1 You can use the stylus for a whole lot more than just circling the answer, you know. Try tracing a path--any path--to see if it connects to more than one town. Try it a few times until you think you have the right answer. Then just tap the Submit icon.

Hint 2 Still stumped? Try tracing paths backward, so that you start from a village and work your way back. This will make it easy for you to see if any other towns are connected to the one selected.

Hint 3 Just look for the town that's not connected to any other. In other words, any town that's connected to another can't possibly be the right answer. If you take a look at the map, you should be able to see any connections between towns with no trouble.
 Circle the village in the upper left corner of the map, in other words the one in the top left corner. It's the village that has red roofs on the houses.

 If the router is not broadcasting an SSID, choose Other... under Choose a Network...


Under Name, type the router's SSID (eg., MyHomeRouter).
Tap Security if needed, and select the security type.
Tap the Other Network button at the top of the screen to get back to the Other Network screen.
 This is the key in your wireless modem setting.
 After you have typed in your security password, click Join and you should be connected. The network name (SSID) should show in 'choose a network' with a check mark next to it.

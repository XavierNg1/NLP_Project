 One must have a clear and relaxed head before accomplishing anything drastic. Do whatever you feel like doing before you begin studying for that test, but DO NOT do something that will steer you off course for a couple of hours. Do something quick and to the point.;
, If you don't have the right materials to begin, then that isn't a good indication that you are ready to learn. Being prepared is essential if you want to study enough.
 If your teacher explains to you what the test will consist of, study only what she tells you will be on the test. There is no need to add extra information into your brain and confuse you during the test. It's always an excellent idea to have some background information, but only the right kind of background information can help you.
 You need to relax and not cram all the information into a short time frame.
 That is an absolute, "no, no". Procrastination leads into panicking and stress because you didn't quite study enough and you are not freaking out over failing it. You can procrastinate all you want after you are comfortable with the information you absorbed during study time, and sure you will ace the exam.
 That will help to ensure that you already know that information and do not need to waste more time studying repetitive information. Then continue on to the next information you need to memorize.


Once you feel accomplished and absolutely ready to leap at the test, you are probably ready to finally take it! If you have repeatedly quizzed yourself on all the information necessary to be successful for the test and know it, then exceptionally well done job.

 Tiles get slippery, especially once they are wet and covered in a cleaning treatment. Wear shoes with good grip on the soles, such as athletic shoes, to help you maintain your balance as you work.Avoid wearing flip-flops or other slip-on shoes without good traction.
Additionally, it’s a good idea to wear old clothes, rubber gloves and eye protection.;
, The strongest and sturdiest areas on your tile roof are located where the tiles overlap.If for some reason you are forced to step directly on the tiles, always place your feet on the lower portion. The lower part of the tile has the most support beneath it., These are the least slippery areas. Plan out your work so that you are always able to work from a dry location on the roof. Try to stay on the flattest areas, as well. Flat areas make it possible to distribute your weight evenly, allowing for better balance and foot traction., If possible, have a partner help you from the ground. Your partner can pass things up to you, which prevents you from having to go up and down the ladder frequently. A partner will also have a different viewpoint from which to observe the roof, and can help to direct you as needed., Even if you take all of the necessary safety precautions, this can still be a dangerous job. This is especially true if you’ve never cleaned your own roof before. For these reasons, most people prefer to hire a professional for this task. The extra expense will be worth it if it means ensuring your own safety.A professional will also have all of the necessary tools and supplies on hand for this job, which means you won’t have to buy them yourself.

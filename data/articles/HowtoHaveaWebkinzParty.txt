 You can invite as many people as you want, but make sure you have enough room to accommodate your friends.;
, If you know the people personally, you can simply call them and ask them to come. But if you don't, you can ask them in Kinzchat plus of the clubhouse.
 Try parts of the Blue Skies theme, Country Western, Jungle, Diner, Kids, Upscale Condo, and Rock themes. Mixing themes will create a happy mood.
 Arrange your furniture in a simple but gorgeous way. Somewhat coordinate your colors, too.
 You may want to put a TV in. This is always entertaining. Multiple people can watch it, and there are 3 great shows to watch! Also, put in some games for people to play. Hockey and Billiards are always popular. Even board games will work.
 To keep your guests Webkinz happy, send them a package in Kinz Post. In this package include a food and a drink. I wouldn't send a gift for them, as this a house party and you usually don't thank them for coming with a gift.

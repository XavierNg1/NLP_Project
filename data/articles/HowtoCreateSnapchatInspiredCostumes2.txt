 This costume is great for last minute parties or events. You'll only need a towel and some fake glasses to pull it off. Fake glasses can be inexpensively bought at most costume stores and general retailers.In place of a towel, you might find that a pashmina, scarf, or turban looks even better for this costume.
Be sure not to use someone else's prescription glasses for this costume. This can cause eye strain and give you headaches., Center the long end of your fabric with the base of your head. Each hand should firmly hold opposite ends of the fabric. Bring the fabric forward, around the sides of your head, so it crosses at your forehead. Then:


Pull the fabric so it is snug against your head. Continue to wrap each end of the fabric around your head to meet at the back of your head, circling it once. Longer fabric may require you to wrap your head more than once.
Tighten the fabric by pulling it so it is firm against your head. Tie both ends of the fabric in a simple knot at the back of your head.
Hide loose ends and edges by tucking them underneath the edges of your turban firmly wrapped to your head., After your turban is wrapped, all you need to do is slide on your glasses to complete the look. However, you may want to make your glasses look extra gaudy by:Using hot glue to add rhinestones to the frames of your fake glasses.
Attaching small embellishments, like feathers, to your frames with glue.
Tying a string onto the arms of your glasses.
 If you're going for the elderly look, you could dye your hair gray and pull a few tufts free from your turban to make yourself look older. You could also include a beauty mark on your cheek, or you might try some other ideas, like:


Wearing gaudy fake jewelry (rings, necklaces, earrings, etc.).
Bringing a stuffed cat to give your costume the "cat lady" vibe.
Wearing a flowing shawl or wrap along with your costume.

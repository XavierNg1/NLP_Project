 Get a paper bag, googly eyes, construction paper, wool, markers, and glue or tape.
 If you don't have googly eyes, you can cut out eyes from the construction paper, making tiny black pupils and gluing them onto larger white circles. Regular glue will work just fine for this -- you don't need to use the stronger stuff.
 Cut a little red mouth out of the construction paper and glue it in place.
 Now, either use strips of construction paper or wool onto the top of the paper bag. Wait for it to dry.
 Use a black marker to draw a nose on the paper bag in between the eyes and the mouth.
 Once you've made face and everything is ready to go, you can play with your puppet!

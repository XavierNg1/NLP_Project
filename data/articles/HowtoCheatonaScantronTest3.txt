 Statistically, you'll stand a better chance of getting a good score on a Scantron test if you just read the answers, eliminate obviously-wrong answers, and make a halfway decent guess. Using good test habits is the best cheat of all. You don't have to be a genius to pass the test.â€” You just have to recognize the wrong answers and make a good guess.


If you're going to be stuck in the testing center all day any way, you might as well take the time to actually do it. It's not like you can leave. Read the answers closely and make a guess. At least you'll have tried.
 If you're allowed to have water during the test, try to write down some helpful information that you might be tested over on the back of the label to have during the test. This is only effective for class tests, not state-wide exams, which are impossible to guess what you'll be tested over.


Remove the label carefully, taking precautions not to tear it. Write vocab words or formulas that you'll need for the test on the back of the label and replace it. Use tape to stick it back on.
 If you've got a Scantron mid-term coming up in physics or mathematics, keeping formulas on a graphing calculator that you use can be a good way to keep helpful information close at hand.


Teachers are typically on the look out for this cheat, and will often make students remove the batteries from the calculator.
 Yeah, yeah, bummer-alert. This isn't a cheat at all, but the best way to pass a test is to know the correct answers. Don't spend time poking around the Internet for ways to cheat the test. Take the time to study instead. That time will be much better spent.

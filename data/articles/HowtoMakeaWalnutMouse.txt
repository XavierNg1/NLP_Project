 Draw around it again to make your template.;
, Trace out the fabric following this template, and allow for an additional 1 centimeter (0.4 in). Cut out the shape.
 Stick the piece of fabric to it, keeping the 1 centimeter (0.4 in) edge around it.
Snip around this edge of the fabric at regular intervals, making tiny slits.
Glue all of the slits firmly around the cardboard, to create a neat edge. Leave to dry completely.

Gently match the cardboard side to the glue walnut edges, fabric side facing outward. Glue the fabric cardboard base to the walnut, slit edges facing into the walnut.
As you attach the base, be sure to slip in the tail and sandwich it between the cardboard base and one end of the walnut base.
Allow to dry.
 For the face:


Cut out two small triangles from the felt for ears. Fold each triangle in half and glue at the base. Then glue either side of the walnut where you've decided the head is.
Glue the goggle eyes where the eyes should be (below the ears).
Glue on a nose. Either glue a small bead on the tip or roll up a small ball of cotton thread and glue in place.
 If this proves too difficult, make a bow and glue it in place.
 If you like the look of this mouse, make it a companion or two.

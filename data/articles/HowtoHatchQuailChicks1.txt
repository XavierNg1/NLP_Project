 To hatch your quail chicks you'll need a high-quality incubator with an egg-turner, a brooder (cardboard box, large plastic container, etc), chick crumbles, shallow water container, marbles or shiny pebbles, bedding and a heat lamp. You can purchase most of these items from hardware stores, ranch-supply stores or possible your nearest pet shop.;
, A brooder is a small box to raise your chicks, it should provide shelter, warmth, space, food and water. You can use a simple cardboard box to use as a brooder or a Tupperware container.


The brooder should have bedding lined up so you can easily and quickly clean the wastage. You'll be aiming at cleaning the brooder at least once a week because chicks are very messy! It's your choice on the bedding you want to use, but keep in mind that some types of bedding are more absorbent than others; which is a good thing. Straw, paper towels or wood shavings are great materials for bedding, where as newspaper is less absorbent and cause splayed legs in young chicks.

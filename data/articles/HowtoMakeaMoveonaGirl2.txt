 If volume allows, strike up conversation. If it's absolutely too loud to talk, trying can at least be humorous. If you're getting along, ask her if she wants to step outside or find a quieter spot. What you talk about isn't too important. Make sure you ask lots of questions, so that she gets talking. If you're talking most of the time, she'll probably think you like yourself more than you like her., If you like dancing, or don't mind dancing, you can ask while the music is fast. Dance casually, separately at first. You can offer to twirl her or otherwise dance while touching in a friendly way after a song. When the music gets slow, hold your arms out or ask if she'd like to dance.


If you can't dance, or have been talking and feel ready, ask her to join you for a slow song.
You can hold her close during a slow song, as long as she seems comfortable. Don't squeeze her or force her against you, however. Ask if she's good when you're in position.
If the dance is going well, you can try moving your face close to hers and wait for her reaction.
Don't grab her on a whim. Even if she's into you, she might not be into blatant public groping.
Ask first. Don't just start dancing against someone you don't know.
 Parties can be difficult to navigate. Skillfully obtaining something for her that she wants will make you look competent and thoughtful. Unless you have actually figured out what she wants, make sure you ask first. Handing someone a drink they don't want can make them feel pressured or misunderstood.
 You don't need to make a physical move immediately. Make conversation and leave a good impression. Get her number or give her yours. If you're nervous, chat with your friends or remind yourself you are not obligated to score. Don't drink to combat nerves, or you'll just get nervously drunk.

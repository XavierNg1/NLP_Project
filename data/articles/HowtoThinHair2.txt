 If you have very full hair that tends to turn into "triangle head" - thick, bushy tips that rise to a point at the top of your scalp - you may want to consider getting a cut to help balance your hair's volume. Layers redistribute the volume for an overall look that is sleeker and less poofy.


Tell your stylist that your hair feels too full and heavy on the bottom, and that you'd like long layers for a thinned-out look.
Avoid getting a straight-across cut without any attention to layers. Short cuts are also harder to manage if you have thick, voluminous hair, since the hair tends to mushroom out from your scalp until it grows long enough to lie flat against your head.
 Curls, waves and frizz make hair look bigger. This is advantageous in some cases, but if you're hoping to reduce volume, a straight look might be the way to go. There are many ways to straighten your hair, both permanently and temporarily, to create a thinner look.


Blow your hair dry with a round brush. The heat causes your hair to dry straight, sleek, shiny, and thinner-looking.
Use a hair straightener. For an even flatter, thinner look, a straight iron does the trick.
Get your hair chemically straightened. If you know you're permanently ready to have thinner-looking hair, a Brazilian blowout or another chemical straightening technique might be the right choice for you. These treatments are expensive (and the chemicals are harsh on your hair and body) so you may want to do some research before diving into this method.

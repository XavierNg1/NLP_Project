 Social media sites are a mixed bag. If you can find the person's social media accounts (and they're not protected), you've struck gold. However, many people do protect their social media accounts, either through privacy settings or through pseudonyms. Finding someone on Facebook is a good place to start.


If the person was an adolescent in the early 2000s, see if his/her Xanga or Myspace is still online. Several of these sites have few privacy settings and can provide a wealth of information.
 Sometimes a manual approach works (e.g. searching Facebook for "John Smith" and scrolling through all 500 results until you find one whose profile picture matches your memory of his face). Often, however, this is more tedious than it's worth.
 If you are able to find someone's Facebook page, you may be able to find a link to their Instagram, or their Twitter, or their professional portfolio. If you are able to find a tagged photo of a person on someone else's social media page, then you may be able to follow this clue to the person's profile. Look for any information that might be useful: a person's hometown, birthday, past employment, associates, etc.

 This lightening spray calls for dried chamomile flowers, cinnamon essential oil, lemon essential oil, and cassia essential oil.Additionally, you will need a large mixing bowl and a spray bottle made of dark glass. The exact measurements for each ingredient are:


1/2 cup dried chamomile flowers;
30-40 drops cinnamon essential oil;
30-40 drops lemon essential oil;
15-20 drops cassia essential oil.;
, Place Â½ cup of dried chamomile flowers in a large mixing bowl and pour the boiled water over them. Allow the chamomile flowers to steep until the water cools down to room temperature (about 30 minutes).After steeping, strain the chamomile flowers out of the water.
Toss out the chamomile flowers or use them in your compost pile.
 After removing the chamomile flowers, add the cinnamon essential oil, lemon essential oil and cassia oil directly to the water in the bowl. Mix the water and oils together using a wooden spoon or other non-reactive utensil.Optional: add 2 teaspoons of propylene glycol to the water. This is a solubilizer, which will prevent the ingredients from separating.
 Make sure the bottle you're using is clean and empty. You may want to use a funnel to transfer the mixture from the bowl to the spray bottle to avoid a mess.


The dark glass is important because it will protect the essential oils from light exposure, which will cause them to degrade and lose effectiveness.
 Spray it onto dry or damp hair and run a comb through it to distribute the ingredients evenly. Use this mixture on your hair whenever you plan to be outside in the sun.


The longer you expose your hair to sunlight with the mixture in your hair, the more results you will see.This method is very gentle and highlights will result gradually.
 By keeping the bottle in a cool place with no light exposure, you will prevent the ingredients from losing their potency. Shake the bottle well before each application.

 At first you might feel self-conscious, especially if this is out of your usual range of style or if it's the first time you're wearing a sundress this year--but if you act like you're the most beautiful person to ever put on a sundress, people will start to believe it!

, Nothing looks stranger than someone wearing a nice floral sundress and a frown at the same time. The two just don't go together, and besides, why wouldn't you want to show off your pearly whites?

, Sundresses and hair-tossing is another good combination, and should also help with your confidence. (Don't overdo it, though, or people will start to think you have a nervous tic.)

, If you don't feel super self-assured you can fake it till you make it, but otherwise you shouldn't have too much trouble getting yourself to relax. Compliments from other people will make you feel awesome about your sundress, and if you've followed all the steps laid out here, you'll have gotten plenty by the end of the day.

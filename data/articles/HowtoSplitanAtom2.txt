 You will need enough raw material to make sure that the fission continues. Keep in mind that in a given sample of some element (plutonium for example), you will have more than one isotope. Make sure that you have calculated how much of the desired fissile isotope is in your sample., Sometimes, it is necessary to increase the relative amount of fissile isotope in a sample to ensure a sustainable fission reaction occurs. This is called enrichment. There are several ways to enrich radioactive materials. Some of these are:Gas Diffusion
Centrifuge
Electromagnetic Separation
Liquid Thermal Diffusion

, Sometimes, atoms decay too fast on their own to be fired at one another. In this case, bringing the atoms closer together increases the chance of released subatomic particles striking and splitting other atoms. This can be done by using explosives to force the fissile atoms close together.239Pu atoms.This method was used to create the 239Pu atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki. Conventional explosives ringed a mass of plutonium; when detonated, they pushed the plutonium mass together, bringing the 239Pu atoms close enough together that the neutrons they released would continuously strike and split other plutonium atoms.

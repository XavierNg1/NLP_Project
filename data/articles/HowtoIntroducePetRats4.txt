 Proceed through these steps over a month versus a week or two due to the aggressive nature of intact males towards other intact males.


Place the cages 4-6 inches apart.  Be prepared for hissing, pissing, puffed fur, swinging tails and attempts to grab at each other through the cage bars.  This may last several days or weeks.
Day before cage-cleaning day switch bedding.  Do this several times over the month to allow them to get used to the other's smell.
Switch cages. Do this whenever you clean cages (before you clean them).



A bathtub, sofa, table, counter or bed are all good areas as long as no rat can escape from it.
Place the new male down first to prevent the resident male from becoming territorial.
Scuffles will ensue, it is important to let them establish their hierarchy, do not separate them unless blood is drawn.
If they do not work it out within 30 min, separate them and try introducing them again in a week.  You may have to do this multiple times.



Make sure the cage, the bedding, all the toys, hammocks, hidey-holes and tunnels are clean to prevent any territorial acts.
Expect some more hierarchical squabbling.  Do not separate them unless blood is drawn or the squabbling is continuous for 30 minutes
Do not worry about squabbling the first couple days as long as it is not continuous.  If fighting continues after a week, separate them & begin from step one.

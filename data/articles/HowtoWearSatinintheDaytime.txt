, Cotton, denim, wool, or other jackets will work well. A jumper (sweater) is also a suitable choice.
 Keep your accessories, jewelry, and shoes simple so that the satin stands out as the feature piece of your outfit. You will most likely get compliments.
 Don't be pulling on your satin tank all day. Make sure it's comfortable on you, and if it's not, maybe satin isn't the best style choice for you personally.

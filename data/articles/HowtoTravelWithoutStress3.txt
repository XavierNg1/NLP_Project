 One way to avoid stress is to be uninvolved in planning and preparation. This works when you are traveling with a companion or a group of people. Let them make decisions about what to do, where to stay, and what to bring. Trust that everything will work out.


If you are on a business trip, for example, most logistics may have been planned for you. Avoid making any changes to the itinerary and simply focus on what you need to complete your job.
 The difference between a 12-hour bus ride and a two-hour plane ride can be a lot in terms of comfort and price. Look at the options and just pick whatever works in the moment. See the positive in whatever choice is made and enjoy the new experience.Be safe. Many accommodation or transportation options may present themselves, but this doesn’t mean that they are all good options. Even if your plan is to go with the flow, make your safety a priority when you move forward on decisions.
For example, you may see that a flight is twice the price of an overnight bus and you’ve already spent money on a nice dinner; however, you’re worried that the bus is in poor condition and the roads are icy. In that case, it might be best to go with your gut and take the flight.
 No matter how far you travel, you will likely encounter new foods, people, cultures, and climates. Step out of your comfort zone and be accepting of the new experiences that come your way.


Try getting food from the grocery store instead of always eating out.
Ask locals where they dine, buy clothes, and go for entertainment.
Try taking the bus or other forms of transportation.
 Some trips go quite smoothly, while others are filled with cancelled flights and illness. Expect to have one or two challenges along the way.

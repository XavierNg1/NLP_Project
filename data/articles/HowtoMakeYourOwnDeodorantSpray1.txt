 Add ½ cup (118 ml) of witch hazel, ¼ cup (85 g) of aloe vera gel, ¼ teaspoon (1.75 g) of baking soda, and 10 drops of clary sage essential oil to a small glass spray bottle. It’s best to pour the witch hazel in first to make it easier for the thicker ingredients to mix with the liquid.You can substitute aloe vera juice for the gel if you prefer.
While clary sage essential oil is an extremely effective deodorizing oil, you should avoid if you’re pregnant because it may induce contractions. Instead, substitute lavender, peppermint, eucalyptus, or bergamot essential oil. It’s best to ask your doctor to ensure that the oil is safe, though.;
, Once all of the ingredients are in the bottle, gently shake it to combine the mixture fully. You’ll need to shake the deodorant spray before each use because the ingredients may separate.Make sure that you’ve securely attached the spray nozzle to the bottle before you shake it to avoid spilling any of the mixture.
 When you’re ready to use the deodorant, lightly mist each underarm area with the spray before putting on your shirt. Allow it to air dry before you finish dressing.If you want to help the deodorant spray dry more quickly, stand in front of a fan with your arms raised or lightly pat your underarms with a towel.

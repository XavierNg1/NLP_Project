Take note of this code.;
, There are several sites on the Internet where you can get an unlock code for your phone. All of you need to do is to go to their website and provide the brand, model, the IMEI code of your phone (step 1), and an e-mail address.

They will process your request (which takes only a few days) and will send the unlock code to the e-mail address you provided.

A confirmation message saying that the code has been accepted will be displayed on the screen.
Your Optimus G has now been unlocked for use with other mobile network carriers.

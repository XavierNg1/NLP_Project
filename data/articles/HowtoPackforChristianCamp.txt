 Do not pack offensive or controversial t-shirts, any kind of revealing clothing, such as pants with drop waists.


Clothing. Shorts must have a minimum 4-inch inseam. Pack at least a daily change of clothes, including modest undergarments and crew socks. Take extra clothes for recreation and special activities.






Shoes. Wear tennis shoes. You may be running, hiking, or other outdoor activities. Flip-flops are a good idea too, but just for the lake or pool.






The Essentials. Bring twin size sheets, a pillow, comforter/raincoat (optional, per need), and pajamas (as warm as need). Towels, washcloths, soap, shampoo (and conditioner as needed), toothpaste and toothbrush, deodorant, comb and brush, sun block and insect repellent are recommended.

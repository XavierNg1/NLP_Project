 Many PhD students are expected to be in the office or on campus from 8:00-5:00 during the week. This will earn you the respect of the faculty.Making a good impression with the faculty, especially as a first-year student, is very important and could open more opportunities for you later.


Additionally, stay late once in a while. Stick around to talk to students you’re teaching, or put in some extra time on your dissertation.
Show up on at least one day during the weekends, too. Vary the time you go to campus on weekends so that you see many different professors (and many different professors see you).
 Keep your wardrobe business casual when on campus, at least during weekdays.This will create the impression that you’re a serious person. Don’t wear cargo shorts, brightly colored clothing, or torn/ripped jeans. Choose neutral earth tones. Men should wear khakis, dress shirts, or short-sleeved polo shirts. Women should wear skirts or slacks. Avoid open-toed shoes and t-shirts.
 Try to understand the main points the author is making, and draw out enough information so that you can talk about it during your seminars with a reasonable degree of proficiency.
 Academic conferences, colloquia, and consortiums are great opportunities for presenting your original research and networking with others in your field who can inspire you to investigate new avenues for research.Your university will distribute calls for papers (CFPs) to you and all graduate students in your department. Check them regularly to see if there’s a conference or other meeting where you feel you could contribute something.


Presentation experience looks great on a resume.
Even if you can’t present at a conference, you should attend as many as you can to keep up with current research and meet your fellow accounting colleagues.

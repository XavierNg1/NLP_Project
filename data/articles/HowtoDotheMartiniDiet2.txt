 The second rule of the Martini Diet is to “eat somewhat less of the very best.” The Martini Diet does not provide exact guidance on how much to eat, but it does offer some suggestions for visualizing portion size.
 To go back to the martini glass comparison, 3 ounces is about the size of a martini glass. As the diet’s creator, Jennifer Saunder, says, your food should come a respectable distance from the top of the glass, like gin, rather than being mounded over the top., Because restaurant portions are often huge in North America, cutting your consumption when eating out will trim a significant number of calories from your diet.


Better yet, share the uneaten food with your love, a friend or a child. There is something fun about doing this and you don't need to feel guilty for leaving uneaten food. Or, ask for smaller portions, such as choosing the appetizer size instead of main course size.
 For instance, eat only 1/2 cup of ice cream instead of eating a large bowl full of it. Or, simply go without dessert more often than not. You will get used to it because dessert is more of a habit than a necessity.

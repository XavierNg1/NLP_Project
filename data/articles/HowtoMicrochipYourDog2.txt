 Microchips greatly increase your chances of having your dog returned to you if she is lost. Collars and other identifying tags can fall off, but microchips never leave your dog once they are implanted., A microchip is a device that emits radio waves at a certain frequency. There are typically three different frequencies that a chip may emit at, but there are universal readers that will read all three frequencies. When the frequency is read, the reader will display the unique ID number attached to your paperwork as well as the manufacturer of the chip. This will tell them which database to contact in order to find your information.


The chip itself does not contain your contact information. It just has your unique ID, which is used to access your paperwork., Microchips do not run on power. They simply reflect a signal back to the scanner. Once your dog has been implanted with a microchip, it will last for her whole life., Most vets charge between $25 to $50 for the implantation of a microchip. This will vary depending on your vet., Microchipping has a very minimal chance of any side effects. There is only a small pain felt when the microchip is injected, similar to that of any shot. Your dog may react to this a little bit, but it will only sting for a few moments.


If your dog is smaller, there may be a little more pain at the moment of injection because she is has less padding.
No surgery or anesthesia is required to implant the microchip. However, many owners opt to have the microchip implanted at the same time she is spayed (or neutered if male) so she gets both procedures handled at one time.There have been a few documented cases of extreme side effects, such as microchip migration that leads to abscesses or, in one case, death, but these are very rare.

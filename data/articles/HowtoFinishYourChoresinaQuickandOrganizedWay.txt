 Write down the chores you need to do.;
, Arrange your list into categories. Prioritize what is most important to do first.
 Decide how long each chore will take and try to complete each one within that specified amount of time. Play a game with yourself by competing against time.
 Keep a steady pace. Multi-task in different situations. For example, when your laundry is in the dryer, start washing the dishes or take out the trash. While you're dusting, you can vacuum at the same time.
 Think of ways to do each task more quickly. Learn to fold your clothes in the same way with speed. Stack the dishes so they'll dry more quickly. Make your bed in the most expedient manner.
 Take pride in caring for your things and home. Your parents will be pleased when every task is done well.
, If your clothes are dry, fold them and put them away. If the dishes are done drying, put them in the cupboard. Do everything on the list.
 Congrats! You now have the whole Saturday to yourself.,

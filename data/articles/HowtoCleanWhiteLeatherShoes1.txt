 Scrape off any excess dirt that's been left over and that hasn't seeped into the leather. Use a soft nylon brush or a cotton rag and wipe over the entirety of your shoe. This should loosen and remove most of the dry dirt and dust that's on the surface of the shoe., Soak your laces in a bowl with warm water and laundry detergent or throw the laces in the washing machine. Removing them while you clean the rest of the shoe will make cleaning them easier., Dampen a rag so that it's wet, but not soaking. You don't want to over-saturate the leather on your shoes because it can damage it over time. Rub the damp cloth over the entirety of the shoe to remove the initial dirt., Make sure to use non-gel whitening toothpaste that doesn't have artificial dyes that can stain your shoes. Put dabs of toothpaste over the problem areas of your shoes and start to rub the toothpaste into the leather with your fingers., Scrub in the toothpaste, working in small circular motions. Continue to do this until the stain breaks up. Clean the entire shoe this way., Make sure to remove all the toothpaste that was left over from cleaning. If you have trouble removing the toothpaste, dampen the rag with a little bit of warm water and rub the toothpaste off of the shoe., Once all the toothpaste has been removed, wipe your shoes down with a microfiber cloth or a rag. You can repeat the cleaning process if your shoes are still dirty. Make sure they are completely dry before storing them.

 At first launch, the app will open to a screen with Featured Articles.



Results will begin to appear as you type. You can use this to refine your search and quickly find the article you are looking for.
 This lets you access Featured Articles, random articles, your bookmarks, and the wikiHow Survival Kit.
 The article will be saved to your bookmarks list and available for reading offline.
 Survival kit articles are permanently stored on your iPad, so you can get help in emergency situations even if you lack an internet connection.

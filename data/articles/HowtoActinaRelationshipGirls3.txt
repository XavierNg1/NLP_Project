 Never keep a feeling bottled up because you’re afraid of your partner’s reaction, or because you’re afraid of sounding silly. If you need time to think about something before you are ready to talk, your partner should respect you and give you space.

If your partner asks if you are all right, don’t say, “No, nothings wrong,” if something is actually wrong. Tell them exactly what is bothering you, and how you feel.
You can say, “Actually, the other day when you were talking to Samantha, I was kind of jealous. Do you like her more than you like me?”

, Try to avoid miscommunication by asking clarifying questions. If you don’t understand what you’re partner is trying to say, don’t shrug it off, or assume that you know.You can say, for example, “I’m not really sure I understood what you meant when you said that you needed some space. Does that mean you want to break up, or does it mean that you want to spend more alone time with your friends and family?”

, If your partner expresses an opinion that you disagree with or don’t understand, try not to judge them in a negative way. Instead, try to understand their perspective. By seeing things from their perspective, you will be able to get to know them better. You might even learn something new, or change your mind about something.For example, if your partner says, "I don't understand why people become vegetarian. It seems pointless to me." Then, ask, "Why do you think being a vegetarian is pointless? What is your perspective?"

 Grow the watercress indoors in a water tray. Obtain a shallow tray, such as a plastic food container from a grocery store. Line it with paper tissue or a sterile potting mix.Wet the paper or potting mix, but don’t add so much water that it’s swimming in it. Sprinkle seeds over the surface. If using potting mix, sprinkle a little mix over the top of the seeds.
 Instead of a shallow container, you could also plant the cress in a three-inch pot that you fill with damp compost.


Sprinkle the seeds onto the surface of the pot. This can be an effective method for growing cress because the cress will eventually starve in a container without soil.
The soil in the pot, especially if it’s damp compost, will provide the cress with enough nutrients to continue growing the cress. Push the seeds lightly into the soil. Check up on your cress every day until it begins to sprout.
 You can use a water sprayer to water the container of cress. You can also soak the container in a bucket filled a few inches of water. The soil will soak up moisture through the bottom. This will only work if you have holes in the bottom of your container., This will stop evaporation. Without the cling film, the cress could dry out fast. You want space an inch or two of space for growth because the seedlings will hit the ceiling of the film eventually. Germination will likely start in about a couple of days.

 The Comm Antenna can be found at the southwest part of the map. Use your map to identify its exact location and proceed to make your way there. You will need to interact with the antenna controls once you arrive.;
, First thing is to click on the antenna controls. There will be three colored lines on the left side of the screen that pops up. The colors are green, yellow, and red. Your objective is to move the cone around the map on your screen using the arrow keys. Once it lands on one of these lines, you will need to click on one of eight channels found on the right side of the screen.


The Yellow Line will be Link 049 and require you to pick Channel 5.
The Red Line requires Channel 7 and is Link 216.
When adjusting the Green Line you will need to pick Channel 2 and Link 840.
 The links will allow you to call a zeppelin to the landing platform close by. Click the button found on the left side of the screen to activate it, select the Zeppelin called Echo, and request transport.
 The zeppelin will take a short time to arrive and land at the docking station. You will need to plant your Omnitool on the control panel beside the docking station to get your next objective from Catherine.
 Catherine will ask you to find a Tool Chip, which can be found from the robot swimming around the area. Pick up a stun gun from the case to the left so you can attack this robot. The robot will be talking to itself while swimming around the Comm Antenna area.
 You can typically find the talking robot nearby the Comm Antenna swimming mindlessly. Use your stun gun to shock the robot a couple times until it crashes to the floor. Take his Tool Chip and return to your Omnitool to leave the area.
 Once you have returned to your Omnitool, there will be a switch to the right of your Omnitool. Pull the switch and Catherine will pilot the zeppelin to Site Theta.

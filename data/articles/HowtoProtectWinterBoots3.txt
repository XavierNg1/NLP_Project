 If your boots are leather, keep them well polished. All types of boots should be kept clean. A regular wipe-down with warm water for many synthetic boots will help remove dirt and other encrusted elements.
 At winter's end, never store boots without cleaning them first and ensuring that they are completely dry. Otherwise, you risk finding moldy, cracked, and possibly ruined boots next winter. Stains left too long may set permanently and weaken the boot. And mold that grows on one boot can cross-contaminate other shoes, boots and items of clothing stored in the same vicinity.


Do not store boots in plastic bags. Suede and leather need to "breathe" and plastic bags restrict this ability, drying out the boot and trapping mold. Better choices include pillowcases, fabric shoe bags and cloth bags.
Store boots away from direct light or heat sources. Direct light can fade the boots, while direct heat can cause them to dry out and crack.
 If the stains are really bad, seek professional help from a shoe repairer, dry cleaner or similar. You could also call the manufacturer for advice.
 A well maintained boot is a long-lasting boot. Repeat the preventative and storing process on your boots every year or wearable season. This will keep your boots in good condition so that they will last longer!

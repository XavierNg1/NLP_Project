 Lemon juice acts as a natural skin lightening agent. The alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) in the lemon act as a natural exfoliant and stimulate new cell growth, creating a fairer skin complexion. Add 8-10 drops of lemon juice to 1 tablespoon of yogurt.
Mix well and apply as a night cream to the face and neck.
Substitute tomato puree if your skin cannot tolerate lemon juice.
Rinse skin in the morning.
Follow with moisturizer, as lemon juice can cause dry skin.

Add a teaspoon of fresh milk cream.
Apply the mixture to your face and neck.
Leave this paste on your skin for 20 minutes.

Apply the mask to clean skin.
Leave on skin for 20 minutes.
Rinse off with cool water and pat skin dry with a towel.

 Use ground pork, chicken, turkey, or any meat you prefer. You can also mix meats for a more creative pie. Try cooking bacon and mixing it into your ground meat. Buy your favorite Italian sausage and cut it out of the casting to mix into your pie filling. You can try lamb, veal, or even tuna flakes.


Make sure your meat is fully cooked before adding it to your filling.
 If you are looking for a sweet and savory pie, try adding some additional ingredients to your filling recipe. Add:8 ounces of raisins.
4 ounces of dried figs (chopped).
2 ounces dried cherries (chopped)
2 apples, peeled, cored, and chopped.
1 lemon zested and juiced.
1 orange zested and juiced.
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground clove
6 ounces dark brown sugar

, Bring some heat to your meat pie with the addition of a few ingredients and seasonings. Try mincing 1 jalapeño  chili and 2 garlic cloves for your filling. Add 4 tsp of curry powder, 1/2 tsp turmeric and 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper. Use these seasonings when cooking your ground beef to create a delicious spicy meat pie.
 Use your favorite ingredients and flavors to influence your own version of a meat pie. For a Mexican influenced meat pie, add refried beans and cheddar cheese to your filling. If you are looking for a vegetarian meat pie, substitute 1/2 cup (90 g) brown lentils for ground meat. You can also try adding artichoke hearts. Get as creative as you'd like!

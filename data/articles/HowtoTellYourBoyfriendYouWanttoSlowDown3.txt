 There’s nothing wrong with a quiet cup of coffee, but if you’re taking things slow, spice your dates up with more exciting stuff to do. Bond over activities that aren’t part of your normal routines. Don’t worry about proposing the wildest thing ever. Just focus on sharing experiences that both of you will enjoy and remember, like:Taking long hikes in parks neither of you have been to before.
Going on a day trip to the beach, city, or some other out-of-town destination.
Signing up for a murder-mystery dinner or scavenger hunt.
 Maybe you asked to spend a little less time together, or to take a break from getting physical. Either way, let him know that this is a breather, not the end. When you’re together, give him clear signs that he still matters to you. For example:Ask how his day or week has been to show that you still want to know how life is treating him.
Maintain strong eye-contact when you talk so he knows he has your full attention.
Touch his hand, arm, or back when you laugh or hammer home the point of a story.
Ask what he thought of a movie or concert as soon as you walk out of it so he knows that his opinion matters to you.
 Show him that you’re thinking about him even when you’re not together. Stick to your ground rules about how often you should text or email each other, but when you do, make it count. Include things like:An added thought or response about a conversation you had the last time you were together.
A memory of some adventure or quiet moment you had that came back to you the other day.
How you’re looking forward to your next date and what you hope to do.

 If you do not have a man-made fire pit, clear an area of all flammable material 3 feet (0.9 m) in diameter. Then dig a hole 10–12 inches (25.4–30.5 cm) wide by 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep. This is your fire pit.;
, (Charred cloth, birch bark, dried leaves/grasses, or other airy and fine materials are great. If you can find nothing dry, use bits of your own clothing, the contents of your wallet or purse, or anything which you may have on you which will take fire.)


Other tinder materials:
Dry milkweed fluff (found in the fall)
Paper gum wrappers
Frayed wooden stick
Dried moss or lichen (found on the ground or on rocks)
Pine bark or pine needles (very flammable)
Pine cones
Cotton ball, may have Vaseline, chapstick (it's mostly wax), or alcohol on it to help it burn
Dried leaves or grasses
Waxed paper from food or candy bars
Birthday candles, especially joke candles that don't blow out

, They burn out very easily. Use wooden ones. But if all you have is paper, don't give up; use them but remember they burn out more easily.
, (3 or 4 corners usually work).
, But be careful to not smother the fire. Add sticks slowly making sure the flame does not get smaller.

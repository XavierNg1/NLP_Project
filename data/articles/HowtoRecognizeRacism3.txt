 For instance, after Michael Brown, a black man, was killed by white police, media and (more frequently) internet commentators claimed that the violence against Brown was justified.


Many people use such opportunities to go beyond simply justifying situations that have racial overtones to claiming that every member of a certain race ought to meet a similar fate. These racist statements are an easy way to recognize racism.
The same people who are unsympathetic to violence or injustice against minorities are often quick to draw attention to violence or perceived injustices against people of their own race.
 Take a step back when thinking about the accessibility and equality of social institutions. You will quickly recognize racism at their very core.


In economics, for instance, you might notice that the average household income for black Americans is close to half ($35,400 annually) what it is for whites ($60,250). The average median household income for Hispanics, similarly, is well below that of whites, at $42,500 per year.The educational system, likewise, is steeply stacked against certain racial minorities. Far fewer blacks than whites attend college, and blacks drop out of high school at higher rates than their white peers.Think about arrest rates or how often people are stopped by police. Racial minorities are consistently stopped more than whites, even though they make up a smaller percentage of the population.
 Racism is behind this double standard.


For instance, if a black politician says, “We don’t need to spend any more education,” he or she might be criticized by white media and citizens; however, if a white politician says the same thing, there might be less outrage simply because they are white.

 Usually, simply screwing the hinges into the fence post will suffice.
 Use a bubble level across the top of gate to confirm it will be perfectly horizontal once attached. If the hinge placement does not need adjusting, screw the hinges onto one of the vertical boards of your gate.


If your gate has a diagonal brace, the lower side of the brace should be next to the hinges.
 Test your homemade gate by swinging it back and forth several times, watching for drag on the ground or wobbliness in the posts.


You can in install a heavy spring so the gate closes automatically, as with a screen door.

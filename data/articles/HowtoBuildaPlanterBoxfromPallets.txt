, If not available, you can purchase them locally for very little money. When searching through the pallet stack, look for the pallets with the most usable wood. The length of the slats is ~ 3 feet (0.9 m). The thickness varies from ½ to ¾ thick. The width of the slats can vary from 2.5 to 6 inches (6.4 to 15.2 cm).
 Breaking the pallets apart takes a decent amount of work. Use a jig or circular saw to cut the ends. Pry the wood from the center support. This should give you 8 to 14 boards per pallet. Remove nails from slats.
 Before you start cutting, determine the best pieces to get the desired width (see drawing). If you have multiple long pieces with cracks and/or damage down one side, you can cut the damage off and still have usable pieces.
 After cutting the pieces, sand them with course sandpaper to remove rough spots or major staining/paint…unless that is your desired look.

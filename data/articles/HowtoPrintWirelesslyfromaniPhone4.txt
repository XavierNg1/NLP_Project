 There are several programs available for OS X that can turn your connected printers into AirPrint printers. The two most popular are Printopia and HandyPrint. Both are paid programs with free trials.


To install the program, download it from the developer's website. Double-click the downloaded file and then drag the program to your Applications folder.
 Your connected printer will need to be shared in order for it to appear as an AirPrint printer:Click the Apple menu and select "System Preferences."
Click the "Sharing" option and select "Printer Sharing."
Select your printer and then check the box to enable sharing.
 These programs are installed into your System Preferences menu. Click the Apple menu and select "System Preferences" to open your System Preferences menu.
 When you open the program, you'll see a list of all of the devices installed on your Mac. Make sure your printer is selected, and deselect anything that you don't want to share.
 Both Printopia and HandyPrint should be enabled by default, but you can double-check the toggle switch in the window to be sure., Open an app that supports printing on your iPhone and tap the "Share" button. Select "Print" and then tap "Select Printer." Choose your newly-shared printer from the list to print to it.Both the printer and the computer will need to be turned on in order for it to appear on your iPhone.

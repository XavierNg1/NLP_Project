 Move your clippers to a part of the horse’s body that won’t be so ticklish. This is likely the neck or their sides.
 Turn the clippers on away from your horse’s body, and allow them to run for a few seconds. Then begin to clip by moving the clippers in the direction opposite of hair growth. Try to keep lines straight and to remove entire patches before moving onto other sections. Watch the corners of the clippers to make sure that you don’t poke your horse with them.
 Work in long, narrow sections to get the most even results. Overlap each new strip of hair your clip off, so that you don’t have any uneven patches. When you reach a whorl in the coat, clip out the hair from different angles to remove it all.
 When you clip near the mane and tail, wrap it and move it to the side so that you don’t accidentally cut any long hairs. If you need, have a friend help by holding both to the side to make it easier for you and your horse.
 If the clip style you choose requires you to clip your horse’s face, save it for last. This will help to keep their anxiety level low. Be sure to switch to the smaller clipper when clipping the face and other sensitive areas.
 If you’re not doing a full clip, there will be areas of the horse which still have hair, and some of that will be a bit long. Use a pair of cutting shears to trim down extra long hair, typically around the legs.
 The hair left on the ground will need to be swept up and removed. Horsehair does not decompose quickly though, so it should not be put in a manure or compost pile. Instead, simply toss it out with your regular garbage.
 Your horse won’t be used to the stark temperature change as a result of having much less hair, so they will need to be blanketed whenever they are put out. In general, if you need a thin coat, put a thin blanket on them. If you’re very cold, they’re also going to need a thick winter blanket.

 The sausages take the longest to cook (approximately 12 minutes), so it's best to start cooking them first. Place them in the pan with some preheated vegetable oil. Turn the sausages regularly.;
, Firstly, clean the mushrooms, but do not wash them. Then slice the mushrooms and add them to a separate pan with some preheated vegetable oil. Toss and stir the mushrooms over gentle heat for 5 minutes, then put them on a warm plate.
 In the same pan that the sausages have been cooking in, place the rashers of bacon in to cook. Turn them every minute or so.


English people often cook back bacon. It's a little meatier and thicker than the streaky bacon you might see in other countries. It includes both the pork loin from the back and a bit of pork belly in each rasher.
 Put the baked beans into a saucepan on the stove and stir over gentle heat.
 Melt a little butter in the pan, or add oil if preferred. You can also use the leftover fat from cooking the bacon, if you've cooked that ahead of time. Crack two eggs into a separate pan. Once the yolks have gone opaque, the eggs are done, thus signaling that the rest of the ingredients are cooked as well.
 Place all the ingredients on a large plate and enjoy!

 It will be easier to hit the chocolate with an object if it is not exposed. Exposed chocolate will likely fly everywhere, so leaving it in packaging will keep it in one place. It’s okay if the chocolate is already out of the packaging. You just need to cover it in plastic wrap.It is also an option to put the chocolate in a jumbo Ziploc bag.
 Make sure the place you plan on hitting the chocolate is sturdy. A weak table or counter may be damaged if it is hit with too much force. You can place the chocolate on top of a cutting board for added protection., There are several tools you can use to hit the chocolate. It is recommended to use a French hardwood rolling pin. You can also use a hammer if you do not have a rolling pin. The tool should not come in direct contact with the chocolate, but make sure it is clean just in case it does.A rock or regular claw hammer with a fiberglass or metal handle is recommended.
 Start by hitting the middle of the chocolate block. Don’t use so much force that you break the surface that the chocolate is on, but don’t use so little force that it does not break it all. Hit the chocolate with your chosen object as many times as necessary until it breaks down to your liking. You should stop hitting the chocolate when it feels like there are no large chunks leftIf you are using a rolling pin, make sure you’ve lined it up to hit the chocolate. Slowly bring the pin down a few times to test it out. The pin can break if it is not properly aligned.
Be mindful of anyone in your area. Do not hit them with the hammer or rolling pin.
 Unwrap the chocolate from its packaging when you are finished hitting it. Observe the chocolate to see how it has been broken up. Go back and chop it with a knife if it is still too chunky for you. Use a serrated knife or chef’s knife. Hold the handle with one hand, and the dull top of the knife with the other. Cut through the chocolate until it is to your liking.

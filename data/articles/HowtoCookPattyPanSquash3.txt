 Fill the bottom half of a steamer with 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Place a steamer basket over the water.


Note that a large stockpot and a metal strainer will work if you do not have an actual steamer. Just make sure that the strainer can rest on the lip of the pot and that a lid can be placed over it.
 Scrub the outside of each squash under running water and pat dry with clean paper towels. Use a sharp paring knife to trim off the green tops and bottoms.


Note that you do not need to peel the squash since the outside is edible. This is especially true if you choose squash that are young and small.
 Use a sharp knife to cut the patty pan squash into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) slices.


If desired, you can use your fingers to punch out any notably large seeds or pulp after cutting the squash into slices.
 Layer the slices in the steamer basket and cover the pot with a lid. Steam for 5 minutes.


The squash should begin to fade in color and should become tender enough to easily pierce with a fork.
 Transfer the patty pan slices from the steamer to a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and mix well, letting the butter melt and coat each slice. Add the honey or brown sugar, a bit of salt, cheese, and basil. Toss once more to coat.


The heat from the cooked squash should be enough to make the butter melt, so there is no need to melt the butter separately before adding it.
 The patty pan squash should be enjoyed while still warm for the best flavor.

 While other kinds of paint stains can result from dripping or excess paint, a spray can is specifically made to be accurate and precise. With this in mind, your first step towards preventing paint stains should be the proper use of the spray paint itself. Spray the can in short, controlled bursts. Make absolutely sure the nozzle is turned away from you before you fire. Remember to shake the can frequently to improve the paint's consistency.Check the instructions on the can if you have any doubts.
 Paint ponchos are specially designed to protect your clothing from staining.They can be bought relatively cheaply at a local hardware store. Failing that, you can also make a paint poncho of your own by cutting arm holes in a garbage bag and wearing it while you work.


Paint ponchos can be uncomfortable, especially if you're painting somewhere where it's already hot. Still, the mild discomfort is more than worth saving your clothes from harm.
 Obviously, getting down to underwear while you paint is reserved only for a few scenarios. Painting at home and inside make the most sense in this case. However, you can't risk messing up your clothes if you're not wearing them. Due to the fact that drying paint absorbs heat, disrobing also helps tend to the issue of overheating while painting.

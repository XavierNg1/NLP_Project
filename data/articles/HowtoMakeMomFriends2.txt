 In comparison to other adults trying to make friends, moms have one connection working in your favor: your kids. Even if you share almost nothing else in common, you are both mothers. Use your kids’ relationships to help you forge bonds with other mothers.


While chaperoning your child’s field trip, for example, you might catch the attention of another mom and say, “It seems our kids are getting on quite well. I’m glad Asher has a close pal in his class.”, Don’t stop at using your kids to spark conversation. You can also take advantage of their inherent need to socialize to fulfill your own friendship needs. If you see your child taking an interest in another mom’s kid, take action to solidify a way for everyone to get to know each other better.


You might say, “Looks like we have two princesses-in-training. Tiffany loves tea parties. Do you think Sandy would like to join her for one?”Use this play-date as an opportunity to forge a bond with the other mom. You might have an adult tea party, too.
 One thing adults lose over time—or, at least, compartmentalize—is a sense of wonder for their environments and the people around them.Follow your kid’s lead and take a step back from the hustle and bustle to truly take in life as it’s happening around you. This can bring awareness to all the opportunities you have to connect with other moms.


Since people enjoy talking about themselves, use this characteristic in your favor. For instance, you might notice that one mom always wear the same pin on her lapel. Ask out of curiosity, “I don’t know if I’ve ever seen you without that pin. Could you tell me about it?”

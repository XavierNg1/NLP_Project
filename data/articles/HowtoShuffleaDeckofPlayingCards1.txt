 Place your pinky, ring, and middle fingers on the side of the cards facing away from you, and place your thumb on the end of the cards that is closest to you. Use your index finger as support on the top side.;
, Make sure that the cards in the deck are aligned.
 Your thumb should be gently pushing up against it, but ready to move away.
 Your thumb should move away when the deck comes down, and then spring back to push down the portion of the deck. Lift up the remainder of the original lifted portion and bring it down at the front of the deck again as you lift your thumb again. Lower your thumb again to guide another portion of the deck down again. Repeat this process until you've shuffled all of the lifted deck into your hand.









Remember to shuffle the cards with a light touch. If you grip them too firmly with the shuffling hand, it will be difficult for them to be gently released into the palm of your other hand.
 Continue to do the overhand shuffle until you've reshuffled the deck at least five or six times. As you become more comfortable with this method, you'll be able to do it more quickly.

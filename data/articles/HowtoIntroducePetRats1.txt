This allows the rats to see, smell and interact with each other without the opportunity to grab the other.
Be prepared for initial aggression and fear, this includes puffing up, swinging tails, hissing, and squealing.  These interactions will become less over the hours or days.
When both rats are simply mildly curious about the other, or completely uninterested, move to the next step.;

Fabric bedding is the easiest to switch between cages, but if you use aspen bedding simply switch the toys, hammocks, tunnels, beds and hidey-boxes.
This allows the rats to get accustomed to the other's smell.



Do not place either rat in the cage with the other, as the resident rat may get territorial and attack the other.
Give the rats at least 30 minutes to explore the other's cage and get a good smell.



A bathtub, bed, sofa, table, counter or other contained area the rats cannot escape from is recommended.
Avoid introducing the rats in the playpen as the resident rat may become territorial.
Place the new rat down first before placing the resident rat down to avoid anyone becoming territorial.
The rats will have to establish a hierarchy.  Be prepared for small scuffles, squeaking, grabbing by the ears or nape of the neck, one rat rolling the other on its back, "power-grooming", and much sniffing.  Let this happen, they will work it out quickly.
Separate the rats if one draws blood, drags the other around, makes the other scream or instigates several scuffles.  Spray the aggressor with a water bottle when they attack and go back to step 1.



Make sure the cage is clean and the toys, bedding, hammocks, tunnels and hidey-holes and clean and rearranged.  This makes for a more neutral territory.
Be prepared for more hierarchical scuffling, this should resolve quickly, within a day or so.
If there are any actual fights and blood is drawn, separate the rats and wait a week before introducing them as per step 4.

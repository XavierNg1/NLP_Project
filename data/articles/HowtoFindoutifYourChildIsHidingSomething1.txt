 It requires a lot of energy for adolescents to keep undesirable behaviors hidden from their parents. The bigger the issue your child is hiding, the more likely it is that there are questionable patterns in his behavior that point to the misdeed. Below are some new behaviors you might observe in your child:Sudden surge in phone calls; talking for longer durations (possibly in hushed tones).
Increase in TV watching.
Increase in online web browsing time (possibly being used to chat with others or research a secret topic).
New friends being mentioned that you haven't met.
New style of dress.
New words or phrases.
New interests (i.e. music, leisure activities, movies, etc.).
More irritable.
Rolling eyes.
Stomping off after talking to you.
Constantly demand privacy when he/she hasn't before.;
, Just as new behaviors may pop up in a secretive child, you may also notice a decline in his/her normal behavioral patterns. Perhaps your child was once very respectful, and now he/she mouths off at any chance. Your child may no longer do the following:Make good grades in school (loss of interest in academic success).
Participate or put energy into extracurricular activities.
Want to eat dinner with the family.
Eat the same amount she used to (indications of high stress or depression).
Sleep for the same times she used to.
Tell you where she has been.
Talk or openly share details about the day like she used to.
Spend time with the family â€” he/she may spend more time with friends or alone in his/her room.
Let a younger or older sibling come into his/her room.
Share possessions (strange signs of possessiveness to certain objects).
 Doing so keeps you in the loop and gives you access to a buddy system for gaining information about your child and his/her friends.

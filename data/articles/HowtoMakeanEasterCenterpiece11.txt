 It can help to decide on the theme before making the centerpiece you'll have. This will determine both the centerpiece style and whether you'll decorate the whole table in the same theme or rely simply on the centerpiece as the focal point.

Work out how much space the centerpiece will require. Also consider is whether you'll display more than one centerpiece––for a long table, you might need to repeat the centerpiece to ensure full coverage.
Will you use a tablecloth? If so, the centerpiece may need to match the cloth.

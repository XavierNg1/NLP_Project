 Being "cool" involves being comfortable with yourself. While others may wear other more popular brands or color their hair, you may not feel comfortable doing the same. Find what suits you, whether its flower hair bands or leather jackets, and wear it. If someone dislikes it, who cares? Only your opinion will matter in the end.
 Following with finding your preferences, finding out who you are is a major part in both middle-school all the way to college. If you are often described as intelligent, show it and participate in clubs that will help you with that description. Some examples for clubs that highlight the intelligent trait include; BETA Club, Assisting the Library, and the Chess Club.
 These are the years where you can be you. Whatever you do in school and outside of school, make sure you enjoy it no matter what others say. Celebrate the years with friends while doing crazy adventures with your family.

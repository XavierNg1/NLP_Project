 Just like other pets, hamsters have different personalities or lifestyles based on their breed. There are many different types of hamsters, so researching them are important to pick out a good friend for your house. Syrian hamsters -- Also known as golden or teddy bear hamsters, Syrian hamsters are the most popular breed. They are easy to handle and are great for children. They are best kept separate from other hamsters, and are completely nocturnal.
Dwarf Russian Campbell hamster -- Unlike Syrian hamsters, Dwarf Russian Campbell hamsters are social are do well in groups. They make good pets, but are not quite as easy to handle. They are also more active in the day time.
Dwarf Winter White Russian hamster -- Dwarf Winter White Russian hamsters are much like their Dwarf Russian Campbell cousins in temperament and lifestyle. They are a bit smaller and quite quick and have been known to bite when nervous. They may not be suitable for very young children, but their sweet and expressive personalities make them great pets for older children or adults.
Roborovski Dwarf Hamsters -- Due to their small size (1in-2.5in) and active nature, these hamsters are not necessarily the best for handling. They are social and good natured, and are nocturnal.
Chinese Hamsters -- Also known as Striped Hamsters, Chinese hamsters are slightly timid but can be handled well. They are a solitary breed, and can be aggressive if housed together. They are also nocturnal.;
, Hamster breeds come in all different sizes, colors, and hair length. Behaviors can also range between female and male hamsters.


Hamsters range from around 1 inch-7 inches, depending on the breed. Smaller breeds, like the Dwarf breeds, may not be best suitable for younger children. Larger breeds, such as Syrians, may be better suited for handling and interaction.
Hamsters come in many different colors and patterns. Syrian breeds are more golden, but also can have brown patterns that reflect the “teddy bear” name. Dwarf Russian hamsters can come in a beautiful white or gray color. Hamsters typically come in brown tones, but also can be white, black, gray, spotted, or striped.
You can choose a hamster with short hair or long hair, depending on breed time. Syrian teddy bear hamsters can sometimes be called “fancy,” which means they have long, silky hair.
 Female hamsters may be more aggressive than their male counterparts. If you plan on getting more than one hamster, experts suggest keeping them all the same gender.
 If you want to handle and play with your hamster, consider getting a breed that can handle this, such as a Syrian hamster. If you would like to observe hamsters in their habitat, a smaller, more active hamster, like a Dwarf variety, may be best for you.

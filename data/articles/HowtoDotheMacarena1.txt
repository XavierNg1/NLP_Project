 Well, you could do it without the actual song, but that'd be weird. So either bust out your Los Del Rio album or get on YouTube or start doing it from memory if you can.;
, There's one beat per count, so the first two eight counts are 16 beats (8 x 2). The first sixteen counts (beats) of the song are subdued -- you just hear a bit of a synthesizer and then BAM! "Ay!" happens and you start right after that.









Feel free to do whatever you'd like during these first two eight counts. A lyrical dance? Maybe the Hustle? River Â dancing? The more juxtaposition, the better!

, Every beat should be 1 through 8. As soon as you hear the "Ay!", know the next beat is one. Every movement corresponds to a specific beat. Always!








, On 2, bring your left arm straight out in front of you, also with your palm down.
 On 4, flip your left hand over. All the way over -- like you're expecting someone to hand you your paycheck.
 Can you guess what's on 6? That's right -- touch your right shoulder with your left hand.
 And on 8? You got it -- touch the left side of your head with your left hand.
 That should be followed by your left hand to your right hip on 2. Can you handle it so far? Are you feeling the urge to feather your bangs?








, On 4, do the same with your left (on your left side).
 Then on 8, jump a quarter-turn to the left and clap your hands. That's it!









Some people don't clap. It's up to you.
 Easy enough, no? Now remember to do it with a smile on your face like you're remembering the glory days of light blue powder eyeshadow and butterfly clips.









As soon as you land, you should be ready to jut out your right hand on 1. Four rotations and you should be exactly where you started.
 The only way you can really pull this off as a dance is if you put your own style into it. So along with the arm movements, feel the music! It's catchy as hell, after all. That Macarena, man. She cray.

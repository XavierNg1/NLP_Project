 Choose a bin that’s large enough for all of your worms. You should provide at least one square foot of space for every 1,000 worms.Drill holes in the sides and bottom of the bin to allow water to drain well.Buy large plastic concrete mixing bins at your local hardware store or purchase a plastic storage bin at a container supply store.
You can also build your own wooden worm box.
 You can either purchase commercial worm bedding or use potting soil. The soil should be moist but not wet. If the soil is too wet, the worms will suffocate. To test the moisture of the soil, grab a handful of soil and squeeze it. Properly moist soil will only release a few drops of water.If too much water is released, let the soil dry some before adding the worms.
If the soil is too dry, spray on some water and mix it in with your hands.
 The worms will find their own way into the dirt. This process may take an hour or so. If a few hours pass and the worms are still on the surface of the worm box, your soil may be too wet or you may have put too many worms into your box.
 If possible, bury the worm box in a shady spot outside, leaving about two inches of the box above ground. If you can’t store the worms outside, keep them under your kitchen sink, in your basement, or in a closet.

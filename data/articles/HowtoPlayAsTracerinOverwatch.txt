 Tracer can be made to bounce through time in the blink of an eye. By pressing the left bumper, Tracer will Blink ahead of her previous position. You can also Blink in other directions by moving the left analog stick and then pressing the left bumper.


Blink at random intervals. Tracer can blink three times in rapid succession to begin with. Each Blink takes three seconds to recharge. Keep this in mind when fighting. You can Blink around and through an entire group of enemies by shooting a bit, Blinking, recharging, and Blinking again in a completely different direction.;
, Tracer can use the Recall ability to jump back to a previous position and state. This is useful for escaping enemy fire. Press the right bumper to activate Recall.
 After dealing a certain amount of damage , you can unlock Tracer's Pulse Bombs. Press "Y/Triangle" to deploy them. The Pulse Bombs will devastate any enemies nearby.
 Tracer is slick and agile, making her hard to hit, but she has less health. Tracer can be brought down with little force, so take caution in firefights.

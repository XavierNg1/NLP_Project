 You will want to make sure that the gum is entirely coated on all visible sides. Add a bit of extra peanut butter so that it forms a thick coating around the gum. Peanut butter is a good product to use because the natural oil in the peanut butter works well to loosen the gum up., You want to only leave it on for a very short period of time or else the peanut butter may stain your clothing. Leave it on for 60 seconds.
 If you donâ€™t have a butter knife on hand, you can use any object that has a thin, sharp edge (a paint scraper, fingernail, or metal nail file should do the trick). Scrape until all of the gum and peanut butter are removed, but be careful not to scrape so hard that you damage the fabric.
 Do this as soon as you have scraped away the rest of the peanut butter and gum. Though the oils in peanut butter are what make it great for removing gum, those same oils can also stain your clothes. Luckily a stain treatment will solve that problem. Add some to the spot and then put it in the washing machine on the cycle you would normally wash it on.

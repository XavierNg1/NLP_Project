 Your brows should be clean of any dirt, makeup, or other debris before exfoliating. Wet your face, and use your favorite facial cleanser to gently clean your face, including the brow area. Rinse your face with warm water, and pat dry with a towel.If you’ve used a particularly long-wearing brow pencil, pomade, or other product, you may need to use a makeup remover on your brow area before cleansing your face to ensure that all of the makeup comes off.;
, Once your brow area is clean, take a small amount of facial scrub and smooth it over your brows. You don’t want to apply too much, but there should be enough for a thin layer across the entire brow.Facial scrubs are sometimes too soft to effectively remove the dead skin cells and stimulate the hair follicles. However, body scrubs are usually too rough. You may want to purchase a scrub designed specifically for the brow area.
If you prefer all-natural skincare products, you may can make your own scrub for your brows. Mix 2 parts olive oil with 1 part sea salt in a bowl, and apply it to your brows. You can add a drop or two of your favorite essential oil to add a pleasant scent to the scrub if you like., With the scrub spread over your brows, gently massage it into the skin. Use a circular motion, and scrub for 1 minute on each brow to ensure that you remove all of the dead skin and increase blow flow to the area.If your brows start to feel tender as you’re scrubbing, stop immediately even if the minute isn’t up. Your skin may be too sensitive to scrub for that long.
 When you’ve massaged the scrub over your brows for approximately a minute, rinse it away with warm water. Gently pat the area dry with a clean towel, and finish up with the rest of your skincare routine.If you have a problem with dry, flaky skin under your brows, it’s a good idea to moisturize right after using the scrub. The moisturizer will absorb into the skin more easily, so the area will be effectively hydrated.

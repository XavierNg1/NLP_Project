 When the oil sizzles, add the chicken to the skillet.;
,, Cook so the vegetables turn crisp. Pour in the cream of mushroom soup and the salsa into the skillet. Cook and mix. Turn off the heat when the chicken has cooked thoroughly.
 Lay a tortilla on a plate or in your hand. Take a spoon and place a generous amount of the chicken mixture along the middle of the tortilla. Sprinkle some Monterey Jack cheese over the chicken mixture and slab on extra salsa. Fold and tuck your tortilla like a burrito blanket and enjoy.

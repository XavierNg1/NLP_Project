, Shape your nails to make them neat. Since you're creating nail art, try not to trim them too short. It's better to have more space to work with.
 Basecoats are usually clear or bluish in color, and can be purchased wherever nail polish is sold. Basecoats protect your nails from getting stained or damaged by nail polish and other nail art materials. Apply one layer of basecoat and allow it to completely dry before proceeding.Some basecoats remain tacky after drying. This texture is meant to help the next layer, the polish, stay in place longer without chipping. Choose whichever basecoat you like best.

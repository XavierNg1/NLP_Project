 Take baby romaine lettuce heads and remove any wilted leaves. Then cut Â½ inch off the stem of the lettuce. Wash the lettuce, making sure to wash away any dirt that is between the leaves. Cut the lettuce vertically into four sections. Pat the lettuce dry with a paper towel.
 Take two stalks of green onion and cut off the green part. Take the white sections and thinly slice them. Then take the garlic clove and crush it with the side of a knife. Snip the ends off of the green beans, and chop up the mint, chives and parsley (or other favorite herbs) if they are not already chopped., Take a large pan with a lid and add the butter. Swirl it around the bottom of the pan until it is mostly melted. Then take the green onion, smashed garlic and chopped thyme, and add them to the pan. Sprinkle on a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir these ingredients using a spoon or spatula for about five minutes, or until the onion is soft., After the ingredients in the pan are soft, pour in the chicken stock. Then drop in the green beans. Raise the heat up to medium and cook for five minutes.If you are a vegetarian, you can substitute vegetable stock.
 Add the frozen peas and the lettuce into the pan. The lettuce should start to braise. Cover the pan and cook the vegetables until they are tender, around 3-5 minutes., After the vegetables have become tender, stir in the herb mix. Then use a slotted spoon to dish up the vegetables onto a plate. Reserve the butter and broth mixture, and reduce it until it has the consistency of a sauce. Pour the sauce over the vegetables and serve.

 Straps, shoelaces, and anything hanging down can get caught in the escalator, causing disaster. Make sure to tie shoes, buckle straps, and pull up anything hanging down before getting on the escalator.

, If your stroller comes with safety straps, make sure your kid is strapped in before entering the escalator. This step is especially important when you're going down, as you'll be tipping the stroller forward as you go down.
 Dangling bags off a stroller can also get caught in an escalator. Either tuck them underneath or pack them away in your purse if possible.
 If the escalator is especially crowded, wait a few minutes for it to clear out. You want to have enough space to maneuver on the escalator safely.
 As you enter an up escalator, lift the front wheels over the comb-plate (the start of the escalator).Continue pushing forward with the wheels up. Let the front wheels rest on a higher step and the back wheels on a lower step.








If you're going down, do the opposite. Let the front wheels rest on lower step and the back wheels rest on a higher step.
Also, make sure you step over the comb-plate when entering.
 Make sure to hold on to the stroller the whole time you are on the escalator. Because it is balanced on two steps, it can easily start moving, especially since the escalator is moving.
 Additionally, make sure you step over it, too.
 Sometimes, you'll need to give the stroller a hard push as you get off. That way, you'll be sure the back wheels go over the comb-plate.
 You don't want to block anyone else coming off the escalator.

 Consider wearing a single gold or silver ear climber on one lobe only. Then, balance the climber with a coordinating stud in your upper cartilage., If you want to create an asymmetrical look, wear a single ear climber in one ear and a coordinating stud in the other ear. For example, try wearing a rhinestone ear climber and a rhinestone stud., If you wear additional earrings with an ear climber, make sure you donâ€™t place the pieces too close together. Doing so will overcrowd the look.

Try wearing a simple gold or silver ear climber with a black or navy blue turtleneck sweater.

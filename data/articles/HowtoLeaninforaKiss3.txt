 It’ll be easier to lean in for that kiss if you’re somewhere secluded and quiet. You don’t have to be the only people there, but you shouldn’t be in a large crowd of friends. Go somewhere where you can chat, and there is a more intimate vibe. Even if you’re at a party, try to go somewhere quiet where you can feel alone., Make sure your lips are not chapped or cracked– that can be a major kissing turn-off. Keep your breath fresh, by brushing regularly and bringing mints or gum with you.If you’re a lady, you may want to avoid the bold, thick lipsticks. These can intimidate a male who isn’t sure what will happen to that make-up if he goes in for a kiss., If you’ve been eager to kiss your crush for awhile and it’s just not happening, despite following all of these tips, you may need to just throw “hints” out the window. If you really want a kiss, and you know your partner is interested too, say it! They might be shy, but at least it’ll get your intentions out there and you can figure out if it’s going to happen or not. If you’re feeling really bold, say something like, “So, if I haven’t made it obvious, I’d really love to kiss you.” Then, if you get a smile or a “Same!” go for it!

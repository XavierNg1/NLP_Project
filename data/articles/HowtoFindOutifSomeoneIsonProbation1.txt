 Many counties make criminal conviction and inmate databases available online. Visit the county court website for the county where the person lives. You should also consult the website of any county where the person used to live, in case he or she was prosecuted and is reporting to a probation office located in that county.


For example, in Orange County, CA, you can search for criminal cases by party name once you create a free account.If you are able to locate a record of a criminal case, look to see if the disposition of the case is listed. The disposition is where you will find the sentence, or an indication that the case was dismissed.;
, If the county court does not have publicly available conviction and inmate records, the site for your local sheriff's department may have that information. Visit the sheriff's department website and look for a searchable database.
 Some privately run websites offer to perform criminal background searches for a small fee. For example, http://us-criminals.org/probation_records.php offers to look up probation and parole records, purporting to use the same databases used by private investigators.Be aware that since these websites are not operated by the government, there is no guarantee that the information generated will be complete or accurate.

 One way to help prevent roundworms is to use a product on your dog that is specifically designed to prevent infection. Adult dogs should be treated against roundworms at least four times a year. There are numerous effective products, ranging from powders, liquids, tablets, and spot on products.Many of the heartworm preventatives are also effective against roundworms, so check the packaging to see if it lists Toxocara species as one of the parasites it kills. You can ask your vet to recommend a product or choose one from a pet store.
Treating the pregnant mother with fenbendazole during pregnancy can stop her shedding larvae via the placenta and milk, which reduces the infection risk to her puppies. She should be given the dose for her pre-pregnant weight, starting from day 40 of the pregnancy and given daily until two days after whelping.Fenbendazole is safe for puppies. They should be treated from two weeks of age, every two weeks until eight weeks of age, then again at 12 weeks. Then ongoing treatment should be with a good worming product monthly until six months of age. After that, an adult regime is used.;
, Feces containing worm eggs are not infectious straight away. It takes several days for the eggs to activate, so prompt removal of feces as soon as they are passed can eliminate environmental infection.If your dog or puppy messes inside, prompt cleaning helps remove any risk of infection.


Feces can contain other infectious agents, so wiping a surface over with a diluted bleach is also advised. To make a bleach solution, mix 10 parts of water to one part bleach.
 To help keep your dog roundworm free, keep a check on whether your pet has contracted the parasite. During regular vet checkups, the vet can take fecal samples to check if the deworming product you are using is effective.Typically four screenings are required in the first year of life, and then two a year thereafter.

 The reason you forget names isn't because you are "bad with names," it's because you aren't fully listening. You may be so excited or nervous about meeting the person or worried about making a good impression that your brain isn't processing the important information: their name.Push aside any other thoughts, face the person squarely, look them in the eye, and listen. Make remembering this person's name your number one priority in the moment., Repetition will help cement this information in your memory, as it strengthens the neural connections in your brain.After the person says his name, repeat it back to him, confirming you heard it correctly. This can be especially helpful with names that are difficult to pronounce.
Repeat the person's name once more, saying something like "It's nice to meet you, Bob."
As you walk away, repeat the person's name in your head.
 Your brain has an incredible capacity for storing visual information, and creating a link between a person's name and a visual cue will make it much easier to remember.For example, if you meet someone named Bill and he has very blue eyes, visualize a blue dollar bill.

 You may have multiple channels, and the more the better but one should be chosen as a primary target for drawing in traffic.;
, This includes writing lyrics, mastering flow, recording until it sounds perfect enough where you are proud, and video editing. Remember the more senses you appeal to, the more entertained people will be. If you honestly like your final product and "feel" it, other people will. There's not many things in this world only a single person enjoys.
 Instead of spending hours posting on stamp collectors channels on YouTube to get 100 views an hour with 5 people that will watch your videos again post on underground rappers walls to get 300 vies an hour with 50 people that will watch your videos again. While watching television why not copy paste a selection of pre written scripts on peoples channels during commercials? Another method would be creating a different account, uploading copyrighted material and having the channel favourite your main channels videos while automatically playing them when the channel is viewed. This technique may be considered "slimy" and "cheap" but the Internets growing competition makes it a dog it dog environment. Fight for that edge.

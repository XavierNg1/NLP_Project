 Locate the app on your iPad. It has a picture of a barometer on it. Tap on it.
 Once the app loads, you will immediately see all the weather data for the default location you’ve set. You can see data for temperature, map, forecast, rainfall, wind and gusts, pressure, sky conditions, and others. If you have not yet set or added a station, the main screen will just be empty boxes.
 Tap the pinhole icon on the top right menu bar. A vertical window will appear under it, displaying all the stations you have saved.
 Tap the Edit link on the top left corner of the window. A red minus sign will appear in front of all your stations. Tap the red minus sign of the station you want to remove, and a “Delete” button will appear. Tap on it. The weather station will now be removed from your saved weather stations and will not be accessible from your dashboard.

 This box can be made from plastic, cardboard, metal, wood â€“ or any other sturdy material. The box can be plain and simple, or rich and ornate. Poke around at thrift shops, antique stores, and estate sales. Look for boxes at junkyards, dumps, and recycled building centers. Try to use a box with which you feel a special connection.Always be on the lookout. You might notice the box laying on the sidewalk on your way to school, or stuffed into the depths of your garage, or jutting out of a dumpster behind your apartment complex.
Consider using a suitcase, or an old lunchbox, or a shoebox. The "box" can be any container that holds your memories.;
, You can craft a simple box from paper, or you can make a sturdier box out of wood. The box should be large enough to hold all of the "memories" that you want to save. Plan ahead: you'll probably want to put many more things in here! In general, try to build something at least as large as a shoebox or an old-fashioned hatbox.
 You don't need to lock the box up, but it might make your memories feel a bit more secure. You can build a lock into the box, if you want to get crafty. Otherwise, you can use a combination lock or a simple keyed lock to seal the lid to the rest of the box. Think about what you'll be putting in here, and consider how much you would care if anyone else looked through it.

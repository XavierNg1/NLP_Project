 In order to cheat in FireRed, you'll need to either be playing with an emulator that supports cheats or be using a cheating device like an Action Replay. One of the most popular emulators is VisualBoyAdvance.


You'll need to start your game before you can enter any cheats. If you're playing on an emulator, you'll need a ROM file for FireRed, which can be found on a variety of different sites online.
 With the game running, click the Cheats menu in VisualBoyAdvance and select "Cheat list". This will open the window that allows you to enter cheat codes.
 CodeBreaker codes are the most reliable way to get Latias to work. Clicking the CodeBreaker... button will allow you to enter in a new code.
 There are two codes that need to be entered to find Latias: the Master Code and the Latias Code. Enter the Master Code first, on two lines:

000014D1 000A
1003DAE6 0007


, Once you've entered the Master Code (which will appear as two codes in your code list), create a new code for Latias:83007CEE 0197


, With your codes enabled, every wild Pokémon that you encounter will be a Latias. Latias' level will be around the same general level as other Pokémon in the area. Make sure that you have a party ready to fight and capture it.
 Since you're cheating to get Latias, you might as well go all out and get a Master Ball as well! This will make catching Latias a breeze, as you can throw the Master Ball at the start of the battle and catch it immediately. Enter the following CodeBreaker codes and then go into a Poke Mart. All of the items for sale will be cheap Master Balls.

 This is similar to outdoor tanning, but it may be a more preferable option in the colder months. It's best to start out tanning for short periods of times (less than ten minutes) because the UV rays are closer than the sun, and they can burn you much more quickly.


Like sunbathing, you still need to stay active in a tanning bed. The best way to do this is to frequently lift your rear, legs, and shoulders off of the bed for about thirty seconds each.
 Make sure to use an indoor tanning lotion, not an outdoor lotion. Many salons carry good options at varying price ranges. It will be pretty expensive, but it's cheaper to buy a bottle of lotion than individual packets each time.
 Choose your package based on how much you plan on tanning. Take advantage of any student, new client, or seasonal discounts.


It is best to tan nude, if you are comfortable doing that. If you're not comfortable tanning nude, wear undergarments that don't leave undesirable tanning lines.
Stand-up tanning is more sanitary, but tanning beds are also cleaned between each use, so it's fine either way.
 Start with a short time, 5-7 minutes, just to find out how your skin handles the tanning. Up your time gradually after the first tanning session.
 Tanning beds can significantly increase your risk of develop cancer. Carefully weigh the risks and the benefits before you step into the sunbed. Tanning beds are especially hazardous to young people. People who use sunbeds before age 30 increase their lifetime risk of melanoma.If you absolutely must use a tanning bed, use it as little as possible, and consider using sunscreen.
Consider tanning in the sun instead, if you must tan at all. Consider using fake-tan products to limit your exposure to UV rays.

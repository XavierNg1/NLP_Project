 When you go to your prenatal visits, ask your doctor how long your baby is. In the early stages of pregnancy, your baby will be measured from crown to rump, while after 20 weeks it’ll be measured from crown to-heel.Write the measurement down or type it into your phone.
 You can go online to find templates, pull a template from a prenatal book, or download a pregnancy tracking app. Depending on what kind of chart you have, insert the measurement. As the weeks go by, plot each measurement on the chart so that you can see a line indicating your baby’s steady growth.You may find that posting a chart on your refrigerator is easy to keep up with and fun for your family to enjoy together.
Consider choosing a chart that allows you to plot out the measurements so that you can see the growth as a line graph. You can choose to connect the dots to see a steady incline, or you can leave your dots singular.
You can also find charts that compare the size of your baby at each stage of growth to different types of fruit. These charts can be a fun way to track fetal growth.
 Babies grow at different rates, but you can find readily available baby growth charts that provide averages for each week of pregnancy. Your baby’s growth can vary, so don’t be concerned unless your healthcare provider tells you that your baby’s growth is too slow or too fast.If you think that your baby’s growth is too slow or too fast, talk to your healthcare provider. Say, “I’ve been tracking my baby’s growth, and compared to averages it’s too small. Should I change my diet?”

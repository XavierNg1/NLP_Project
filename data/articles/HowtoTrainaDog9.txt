 This will only start him down the path to begging. Ask him to go to his bed or crate and stay there without whining while you and your family eat.


When you are finished eating your meal, you can then prepare his meal.
 There’s nothing more annoying than a dog who jumps and barks while you’re trying to prepare his meal. Instead, use the “wait” command he learned in doorway training to have him wait outside the threshold of the room where he's fed.


When you're ready, have the dog “sit” and “wait” while you place the food on the ground.
Stand up and wait a few breaths before giving your release word. You can use “free” or you can create a new command for feeding time like “get your food” or “yummy.” Try to choose something you wouldn't accidentally say to other people, such as "time to eat," or, "let's eat," as this might falsely cue your dog that it's time for his dinner.
Eventually, he will sit on his own as soon as he sees his feeding bowl.

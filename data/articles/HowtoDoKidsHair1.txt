 Start with clean, dry hair. Use a comb or paddle brush to gently brush out any tangles or knots.


This is a versatile style that works with straight, wavy, and curly hair. Additionally, the length of the hair can be medium or longâ€”as long as there's enough to put into a standard ponytail, you should be able to complete this look.;
, Gather all of the hair at the back of the head, bringing it together at a point near the nape of the neck.


Keep the sides and tail as smooth as possible. If necessary, gather the hair with one hand while continuing to brush it using your other hand.
Secure the hair with a ponytail holder.
 Carefully push the ponytail holder down by 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm).


The exact distance will vary depending on the length of the hair. Make sure that the hair beneath the ponytail is at least as long as the hair in between the ponytail and the head, if not longer.
 Use your pointer and middle fingers to carefully separate the hair just above the ponytail holder.


Try to keep this gap centered above the ponytail holder. It may not stay automatically at this point, so prepare to hold it in place with your fingers until you complete the next step.
 Using your other hand, flip the end of the ponytail up and through the gap you just created.


Pull the end of the ponytail all the way through the gap until it hangs straight down again. As you do this, the gap should remain fixed in place and the hair above the ponytail holder should twist.
If the ponytail sticks out too much instead of hanging down straight, carefully pull the elastic band down a little further to relax the style more.
 Carefully brush the hanging end of the flip tail with a paddle brush, smoothing out any tangles that may have developed as you worked.


This step completes the style.

 If your cleaner does not already come in a spray bottle, put the cleaner in a spray bottle. Spritz a light layer of the cleaner over your limestone floor to start the cleaning process., You can use a towel, mop, or paper towels to wipe down the tiles. Use a light, buffing motion to give the tiles a nice shine. As set-in dirt and grime has already been removed, you should only need to give the floor a light cleaning., If you noticed any stains you missed earlier, use a toothbrush to scrub them out. Use circular motions to remove any stains on the floor, such as stains from liquids or spilled food. Work from the outside in to remove stains.

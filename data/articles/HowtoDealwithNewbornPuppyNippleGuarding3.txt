 If your puppies are still struggling to nurse and gain weight, you should visit your veterinarian. The veterinarian may highlight another issue that is preventing your puppy from nursing properly or gaining weight. They may also recommend supplements and other dietary aids to help your fading puppy., Although you would ideally want to pull the larger puppies, you may also need to remove smaller or fading puppies in order to provide extra nourishment. You should only bottle-feed a puppy if it is too small and weak to nurse or if the litter is so large that there are not enough teats for each pup. Once you begin bottle-feeding any smaller puppies, make sure that you continue you to bottle-feed them. After you remove the puppy, the mother will only produce enough milk to supply the nursing puppies., The best way to prevent future nipple guarding and malnourishment is by spaying your dog. This is particularly important if you have a female dog that has already delivered a litter of puppies and struggled to produce enough milk. If your dog could not produce enough milk to feed its previous litter, make sure that you spay it before it goes into heat again.Unless you are a professional breeder, you should spay your dog before its first heat, which is around 5 to 6 months of age.

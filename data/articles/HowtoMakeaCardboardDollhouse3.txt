 Shoeboxes make perfect pre made rooms for a dollhouse. The more shoeboxes you can find, the larger you can make your house.It is best to use shoeboxes with separate lids.
 Set up the shoeboxes according to size. You will want to use the largest shoeboxes for the bottom floor of your house and build up using smaller boxes.
 Use a hot glue gun to stick shoe boxes together. Attach the side of one shoe box to the side of another shoe box using a hot glue gun. Each box will become an individual room of the house. You can place them side by side to create many rooms on the same floor of the dollhouse, or stack the shoeboxes on top of each other to create a multi-story house.


Run a line of hot glue around the edges of one side of a shoebox and attach it to the side of another box.
Be creative when configuring your boxes. You can build a house in any shape you can imagine.
Make a multi-story home by stacking 3 to four boxes on top of each other.
 A razor or xacto knife works best to cut out pieces of cardboard from the center of the box.


Cut out three sides of a rectangle on interior surfaces to create doors between rooms. You will need to cut through two boxes and leave one long edge on the side to make a door that will open and close., Acrylic paint will be more durable than poster paint or tempura paint and is a better choice when the house is going to be played with.


Use different colors to paint the outside of your dollhouse and give it a finished exterior.
Paint around windows and doors to add trim.
 Decorate the rooms of your dollhouse to give your house a unique personalized look.Use wrapping paper to cover the walls for wallpaper.
Cut pictures from magazines to decorate the walls.
Use fabric squares to make rugs and floor coverings.
 Finish the interior of the dollhouse with customized furniture. Furniture can be purchased pre made for dollhouses, or you can build your own from cardboard or craft sticks.

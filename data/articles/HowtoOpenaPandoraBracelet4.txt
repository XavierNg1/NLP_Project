 Turn the clip bead around the open bracelet until you see the vertical groove running along one side.


Note that you must open the bracelet before you can open any clip beads. The clip bead will be located at the end of the bracelet, directly beneath the post of the latching mechanism.
 Slip your thumb nail into the groove. If necessary, you may use both thumb nails to create better leverage.Similarly, you can insert a Pandora clasp opener or the side of a thin coin into the gap instead of using your nail.
Brace the sides of the bead against your other fingers or against your body to help hold it still while you work.
 Apply firm, even pressure against the gap in the bead. Continue pushing outward against this gap until the bead pops open.


As soon as the bead pops open, it should fall away from the side of the bracelet.
Once the clip bead falls off, the remaining beads on the bracelet should slide off the post end of the bracelet without difficulty.

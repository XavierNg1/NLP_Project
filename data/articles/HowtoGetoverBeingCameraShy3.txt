 Talk to a professional photographer to help find out what works best for you. Let them know that you are camera shy and that you want their help getting comfortable having your picture taken.Book a short photo shoot. Work with them on posing, stance, lighting, or other issues about which you may have questions.
Ask specific questions about things that make you nervous. If, for example, you don’t want people to see a feature such as a scar or birthmark, ask them, “How can I pose to downplay this feature but still look comfortable?”

, Whether it’s a professional photo or a candid shot, get a friend to help you out. If you worry about being the center of attention, bringing other people into the picture is a great way to diffuse focus.


If you are going out with a group, ask a friend to be your photo buddy. Ask someone, "Hey, will you jump in next to me if someone pulls out a camera?"
If you have to do a solo shoot, have a friend or loved one there to support you. Ask if they can stand alongside the photographer or near you but just out of the shot. Focus your attention on them instead of the photographer by asking, "How was your day?" or something else unrelated to the photo shoot.
 Take your focus away from the camera by putting it on something else. Find or bring a distraction to make things easier.If you have a photo shoot planned, have music or a video loaded on a device that you can play during the shoot.
Bring a friend or family member to talk to during a formal shoot. If someone brings out a camera while you are out, simply start talking to a friend.
Find another event on which to focus. For example, if you are out at a park and your group takes out their cameras, focus on a dog going for a walk or an oddly-shaped cloud instead of the cameras.
 The best way to get over being camera shy is through exposure. Keep challenging yourself to step in front of the camera, and eventually it may become easier.

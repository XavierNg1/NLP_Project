 Then simply install it and put it on your desktop.;
, After having successfully downloaded & installed the Cheat Engine you now need to open the Roblox game you desire to hack your walk speed on.
 After having started the game, let it load until it does not lag and every single brick is loaded successfully.
 Now that the game has finished loading, start Cheat Engine (which you downloaded earlier).
 Now you need to select a program to hack. To choose Roblox, click on the computer in the top-left corner.
 RobloxPlayerBeta.exe is the program used by Roblox to start games. You will want to select that program to hack your walkspeed.
 Change the "Value Type" to "Double". It is displayed as a drop-down menu when you click on it.
 Now you will want to scan the RobloxPlayerBeta.exe program for values named "60". Why? Because the animation program (and walkspeed) has two values named 60 on the program.
 This is the hard part. You will want to find the first two values named "60" and double-click them so they appear on the lower part of the Cheat Engine menu. Warning - the two values are separated and don not contain decimals such as 60.348 or 60.00. They are just displayed as 60.
 After you've found and double-clicked the two 60's, they will move to a lower box in the Cheat Engine. Click their value and change it to 750. This will be your new walkspeed.
 You're now MUCH faster! Enjoy!

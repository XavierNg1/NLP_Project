If you choose the email version, it will create a username for you by using your email address. This can easily be changed later under "Preferences".
, This will make it easy to add any website to your clipboards.
 It's called "My First Clipboard". You can add as many clipboards as you want.


You can change or remove any of these clipboards by simply hovering over a clipboard and waiting for the delete (X) and edit icons to appear. Click and you will be able to remove or change the names of the clipboards.
 You can share as a clipboard as follows:


Click on Share as a Clipboard. You can enter the name of the Clipix friend, then press done.
Alternatively, add in the email address of your friend and send. They'll need to join if they haven't already.
In either case, you have space to also add a personal message, explaining why you're sending this to them.
If you want to collaborate with others on a clipboard, share as a "syncboard" instead and additions will show up in real time as you and your friends add/remove clips. This could be helpful for school projects, event planning, clubs; probably also great for spouses redesigning their home!

, When you click on the Clipix icon in your toolbar, a box will appear that allows you to choose which clipboard you'd like to add the site to. You will have the option to name the site and add a small description (perhaps to remind yourself why you wish to come back to it). You can also create new clipboards here if the ones already existing aren't reflective of the site's content.


After clipping, you can send the clip to friends via Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or email.

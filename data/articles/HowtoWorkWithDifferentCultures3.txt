 One of the best ways to learn about a new culture is by hearing some personal anecdotes. Ask your new co-workers or clients to tell you some stories. Listen with an interested and curious open mind.Perhaps you have some new clients from South Africa. You can ask them to tell you stories about what life is like there.
You can say something like, "What do you typically do for fun after work?" Then you can offer examples of your own experiences.
Listening to stories is a great way to form bonds. You'll learn something new, and likely find more commonalities than you expected.
 Learning to communicate better will help you to work with people from different cultures. One of the most important components of effective communication is asking questions. Questions are a great way to clear up differences and also a good way to get to know people.If something is unclear, just ask a question. For example, you could say, "I noticed that people in this office bow to one another in greeting. Is that something I should do, also?"
Try asking open-ended questions. For example, instead of saying, "Am I doing this right?", try asking, "How can I improve my performance?" You'll get a more informative answer.
Listen carefully to the answer. When you ask a question, pay attention to the response and try to retain the information.
 It may take some time to learn to work with new people. Make it clear that you are putting in effort. Make it clear that you are sincere in wanting to better your communications.Do something that indicates you are trying. For example, try greeting someone from a different culture in their language.
Most people will appreciate a gesture like that. It won't take much work on your part, but it indicates your sincerity.
Smile. This generally means that same thing in most cultures.
Take time to reflect. If you have had trouble communicating, spend some time asking yourself where the breakdown occurred. Then try to improve tomorrow.

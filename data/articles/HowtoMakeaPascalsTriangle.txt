,, For every new line, you will have one more number than the previous one. Each outside number is a 1 every time.
 Each inside number can be found by adding the two numbers above it. For example, The middle number on the third line of Pascal's Triangle is 1+1=2.
 You will notice many interesting patterns that form as you build the layers of your triangle.


The one row consists of only ones. The following rows consist of the counting numbers, followed by the triangular numbers.The sum of the numbers in each row (with row number given) is about the answer of 2 to that number expressed as an exponent (uses base-2).Keeping in mind that the first number in any row is the 0th element 1, if you take the next number in that row and divide all the other elements in that row, you'll see that the items are evenly divisible by the row number expressed.
Each line of the Pascal's triangle, has a direct effect on being shown using a base number to the power of the row number, with a few exceptions. Some rows where the next box contains one or more numbers for the box, the tens place gets added to the box to the left of it.Look for the symmetrical pattern in the Triangle..

Repeat the squats squats until you are fatigued and can no longer do them with proper form.



If you did less than 10 squats, your legs are relatively weak.
If you performed 10 to 20 squats, your leg strength is average.
Your legs are strong if you are able to do 20 to 30 squats.
If you were able to perform over 30 squats, your legs are in excellent shape.
Recording how many squats you are able to complete will help you to determine how much your lower body strength has increased after working them out. Repeat this test periodically.

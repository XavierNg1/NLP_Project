 Relationship obsessive compulsive disorder (ROCD) is a form of obsessive compulsive disorder. It causes you to have irrational fears and thoughts about your relationship. Those who experience self-doubt may also have this disorder.


Treatment for ROCD can include taking small steps that help you learn to trust your partner. For instance, not checking in on them as much and allowing them to do things by themselves without worrying., Talking to a therapist with your significant other may help your relationship. Your partner can discuss what they experience from you and their problems with your coupledom. The therapist may then suggest ways they can cope and help you overcome your insecurities.


Ask your significant other if they are willing to go see a therapist with you. For example, try saying, “I really want our relationship to work but I fear my self-doubt is harming things. Would you want to go to couples therapy with me so we can figure out how to make it work, together?”, You may also use therapy to determine why you are so insecure. Perhaps you were cheated on in a previous relationship. Maybe you heard that you were a failure growing up. Figuring out why you feel this way can help you to stop being so critical on yourself.



A therapist can help you to determine what caused these feelings of self-doubt. You may also discover why by speaking with someone you love and trust., Engaging with other people who share your struggles may help you stop. They may also give you encouragement on what to do to make the self-doubt and sabotage end.


Ask your therapist or doctor for support groups in your area. Consider attending a virtual support group if you would prefer to become involved in one from the comforts of your home.

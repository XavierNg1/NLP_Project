 Kha'zix thrives on being able to use all of his abilities as much as possible without running low on mana in the beginning stages; he will be taken down easily otherwise. He needs Damage and Health, so a good first item in the jungle is a Black Cleaver. Do not stay in lanes you gank too long, or you will attract too much attention and get focused on early.;
, Once you have a tanky build, which usually consists of Black Cleaver, Frozen Mallet, Bloodthirster, Sunfire Cape, and sometimes Guardian Angel, depending on the game, your main job turns from occasional ganker and farmer in the jungle to major assassin and ruthless killer all over the map. With your ultimate ability, get your Q ability first, then your wings, then your healing ability, then active camouflage (your ultimate). It's all a matter of getting stronger than the other team and taking down the weaker players so that you can get strong for the late game Team Fights.
 Sitting in a bush waiting for the moment is much better than standing in lane and using your ultimate when everyone can see you. Wait for your moment, use your ultimate and then pounce on your enemies. If you are going in alone, be aware of who you are fighting against and be more cautious.
 Ask questions, organise plans, etc. A team that communicates is better than the team that does not and already has a crushing advantage.
 With Kha'zix, the summary of use of abilities once you are full level 18: Ultimate, Leap, Q, W, (ultimate again if cooldown is up) and repeat. Of course, change the order if you see more fit or have to plan an escape. Always be in communication with your team, and have fun. Remember: it's all fun and games until somebody gets face-checked in the bush, then it gets hilarious.

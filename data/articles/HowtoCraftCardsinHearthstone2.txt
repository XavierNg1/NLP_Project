 In order to create new cards you will need a material called arcane dust. This material can be obtained through playing various aspects of the game or through destroying cards you do not want. This process is called disenchanting. Different card types will give you different amounts of dust.Common (White) cards will break down into 5 dust.
Rare (Blue) cards will break down into 20 dust.
Epic (Purple) cards will break down into 100 dust.
Legendary (Orange) cards will break down into 400 dust.
 Cards you own and that can be disenchanted will show up in a full color preview. Cards you cannot disenchant or that you do not own are faded and transparent., Once you have decided on a card to disenchant, click it and a menu will pop up. You will have the option to “Create” or “Disenchant” the card if possible. Click “Disenchant” and arcane dust will be added to your collection. The amount of dust you have can be viewed in the bottom-right corner of your screen.

 Just assume from now on that at the beginning of every dance, your right toe is pointed in front, your left foot is pointed outward, and your shoulders low and back, hands at your side.
 Then, point your left foot and put it in back. When you "put it in back," put it in the same opening foot position -- closed and crossed.
 That's a lifted knee on 1 (the right knee) and walking (on your toes) for 2,3,4,5,6, and 7. On 7, place your left foot solid on the ground.


When you lift your knee, really lift your knee and keep your toe pointed. The more exaggerated you feel, the better it probably looks.
 This takes up an 8-count. Start again with your right foot, taking 4 counts. If you say it aloud, "point" is on 1, "back" is on 3, with silence on 4. For the left foot, point on 5, back on 7.
 Again with the right knee, lift it high and place it down in front of your left foot. The "step in" serves as a ball change; when you place your right foot down on "step," shift your weight to your left foot on "in." When your weight is on your left, point your right foot forward and bring it back to conclude the step.


Once you get the basics down, make it "hoppy." There should be a livelihood to your points and knee lifts that makes it seem like you're sort of jumping. With every accented step, add a small hop on your back foot.

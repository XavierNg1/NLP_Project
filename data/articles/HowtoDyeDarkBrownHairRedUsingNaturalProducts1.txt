 If you live in a tropical country you may be able to find fresh Jamaican sorrel. It's a bright red flower that can be used to add a ruby hue to your hair that sparkles in the sun. If you can't find fresh Jamaican sorrel, buy the dried version instead. You'll need two cups. In addition, get the following supplies:


2 cups water
1/4 cup honey;
, Place the two cups of water in a small saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to a boil, then add the sorrel, cover the pan with a lid, and turn off the heat. Let it soak for several hours so that the sorrel dye steeps into the water, then strain the water into a bowl and mix in the honey.
 Shampoo your hair as usual, but don't use conditioner. Conditioner stays in the hair and can prevent the dye from setting as well. Towel dry your hair and use a wide-toothed comb to remove tangles.
 Put on latex or plastic gloves and use your fingers to spread the mixture through your hair from the roots to the tips. Make sure to distribute it well so that no strands of hair get left out.


If you want red highlights, choose just a few strands, separate them from the rest of the hair using strips of aluminum foil, and use an old paintbrush or pastry brush to apply the treatment.
 Use a plastic shower cap or plastic wrap to cover your hair so it doesn't dry out while the dye is soaking in. Let it sit for 4 hours or overnight. The longer the dye stays in your hair, the redder it will look.
 Remove the cap or plastic wrap and rinse your hair with warm water. Shampoo and condition as usual, then dry your hair and style it.

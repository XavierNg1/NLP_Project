Get back to activities, people, and places you loved that maybe fell by the wayside when you met your ex. Reconnect with your old self to help bridge your past and future.

Have you dreamed of going back to school? Could you make a promotion at your current job? Would you like to live closer to your family? Dream big, but move slowly.

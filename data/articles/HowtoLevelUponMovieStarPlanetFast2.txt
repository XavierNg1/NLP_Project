 As you play games within the MSP world, you will be rewarded with Fame; the more games you play, the quicker you'll level up., This is located in the top left corner of your MSP screen.
 MovieStarPlanet has several categories of games, all of which will award you large amounts of Fame upon completion:


"Dress Up", which asks you to dress your character a certain way in a limited amount of time. Dress Up is largely contingent on other players' approval and takes quite awhile to yield results, so it isn't a very good option for building Fame.
"Crazy Cards", which lets you judge the appearance of other players. Since this relies on other players' judgement, it isn't ideal for building your Fame quickly.
"Quiz", which asks you multiple-choice questions. This is your best option for leveling up quickly; you gain fame for every correct answer you get, and the longer you play, the more answers you'll consistently know.
"Arcade", which contains classic arcade games as well as original ones. While generally the most accessible, these games net you very little fame.
"Catwalk", which is reserved for level 6 and up. Catwalk isn't ideal for leveling up, since it relies on player judgement like Dress Up.
"Casting", which lets you create movie scenarios. Similar to Catwalk, Dress Up, and Crazy Cards, this game takes longer than the others, is contingent on player approval, and doesn't afford you much Fame upon completion.
 Playing any of MSP's games will earn you Fame.
 This is a strategy known in video games as "grinding"--repeating an action that nets you money, experience, or, in this case, Fame. Once you become accustomed to a particular game, you'll be leveling up in no time!


The "Quiz" category is the best way to earn fame quickly. It's the only game category with a large amount of Fame as your reward that relies on your ability rather than another player's judgement.

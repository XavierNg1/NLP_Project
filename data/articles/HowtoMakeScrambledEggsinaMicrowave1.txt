;
,,, Have caution since the bowl may be hot, so wear mitts. Remove, as they will be partially formed (see Warnings below). Use your fork and stir them gently, so that the uncooked blends in with the still loose egg. Set the eggs back in the microwave. You may also consider covering the bowl with a napkin to prevent any splatter.
 Be sure not to overcook the eggs.

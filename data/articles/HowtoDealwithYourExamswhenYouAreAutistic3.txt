 Make sure that you read everything on the page, even if it looks irrelevant at a glance. It may help to read the questions aloud (if you are in a private room) or have a reader.
 If you struggle to write down what you mean, then sometimes it may help to draw a picture, especially if it is something like a science exam. It is always better to put something down than nothing, even if you are not sure of the answer. Remember; if you have time at the end then you can always go back to the question. However, be aware that irrelevant doodles could make your GCSE exam invalidated.
 If you find your focus slipping away, stop. Take a break to stim, stand up and stretch, rock in your chair, et cetera. Having a private room is especially helpful, because you don't need to hold yourself back when stimming, and you can get up to pace and re-orient yourself.
 It can be helpful to "re-take" the exam by reviewing all the questions and calculating your answers a second time. Checking your work can help you find little mistakes and raise your score by several points.

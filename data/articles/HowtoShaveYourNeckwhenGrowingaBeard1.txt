 Imagine a line that loops from the back edge of each ear down and around the top of your neck. Envision the lines meeting in the center of your neck (below your jaw)., Find the rear edges of your sideburns. Imagine a straight line extending down from each. If you donâ€™t have any sideburns, allow them to grow in a bit so you can better identify where the rear edges of your sideburns are., Everything above the first line you visualized and in front of the second line you visualized should be allowed to grow in. Anything below or otherwise outside those lines should be shaved.

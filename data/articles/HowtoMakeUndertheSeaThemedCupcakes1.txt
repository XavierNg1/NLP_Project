, Essentially, creating these cute cupcakes comes down to what you are comfortable doing. Are you interested in creating a crab completely from frosting or would you prefer building a small sea creature using gumdrops?, Taking time and skill into consideration, how long will it take you to create the desired number of cupcakes with your chosen method? While you may want to try your hand at a detailed frosting crab; do you have time and energy to create 40?, Using a cake mix from a box or even ordering plain cupcakes from the local bakery (that you can decorate at home) will save a few steps if you are pressed for time., Will you have another adult pitching in to decorate the cupcakes or does your child want to help? If your child wants to help (and you are willing to work together), you may want to go with an easier design that he/she can assemble with ease.

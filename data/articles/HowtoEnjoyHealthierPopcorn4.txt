 Serving sizes will vary based on the type of popcorn that you’re eating, but 1 cup of plain, popped popcorn contains 30 calories. Make sure to measure how much you’re adding to the bowl that you plan to eat from so you know the precise amount that you’re eating.Keep in mind that any toppings that you add to your popcorn, such as butter, oil, or parmesan cheese, will add extra calories and fat. Measure the toppings too, so you can keep track of how much you’re eating.
 You can make your popcorn more filling by pairing it with protein. Proteins are usually more filling than the carbohydrates in the popcorn, so you feel full longer if you eat your popcorn with a tablespoon (16 g) of peanut butter or 2 ounces (75 g) of cheese. That can help keep you from overeating.You can eat the popcorn with your favorite protein. Just be aware of the serving size for the food, so you don’t overeat.
If you’ve already topped your popcorn with parmesan cheese, it’s best not to eat it with cheese. You may wind up consuming too much fat and sodium.
 While making microwave popcorn may be quick and easy, it is often extremely unhealthy because it’s full of sodium and artificial flavorings. It’s also hard to control the portions that you eat because the bags are large. Make your own popcorn so you can control how much eat and what goes into it.Don’t assume that light or low-fat microwave popcorn is healthy. It is usually loaded with sodium and artificial butter flavoring that can be very unhealthy.

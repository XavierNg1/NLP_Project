, For most bedrooms, the focal point is the bed because it is usually the largest piece of furniture in the room.


Buy the most luxurious bed linens you can afford.
Choose a color scheme that you love. If your walls are a neutral color, you can add a comforter and pillow shams that have multiple colors and designs. Also you can paint all your walls a neutral color, and then paint the wall with your bed against it an accent color.
Add colorful throw pillows to your bed. You can easily move them to a chair or a dresser at night before you go to sleep.

 Paints with soft pale hues are considered to create a more restful and sleep-inducing ambiance.
 Replace harsh, bright light bulbs with soft, low-wattage bulbs. Replace broken, torn or shabby lampshades with fresh new lampshades.
, If your bedroom has old carpeting and new flooring material is not in your budget, try adding a few throw rugs to breathe new life into your worn carpeting.
 Experiment with various heights, colors and textures. For example, pair a tall sculpture with a round woven basket placed on a crocheted runner, or put a few books next to a vase of flowers.

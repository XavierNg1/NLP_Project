 Prepare a shallow, rimmed baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil.


If you would prefer to skip the foil, you could coat the baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray, instead.
 Use a sturdy serrated kitchen knife to cut the squash from end to end. Remove the strings and seeds, then cut each half into 1-inch (2.5-cm) slices.


Before cutting your squash, make sure that it is clean. Scrub the outside with a vegetable brush under cool, running water until all visible dirt is gone.
If you have difficulty holding the squash still as you cut it, try cutting it on a rubber cutting mat to provide more friction.
Use a metal spoon or ice cream scoop to remove the seeds from the center of each half.
 Arrange the slices on your baking sheet and drizzle the olive oil over them. Toss well to coat, then sprinkle with salt, black pepper, cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper.


Try to disperse the seasonings over each slice evenly.
 Turn the squash slices over halfway through the cooking time. When done, the wedges should be slightly browned and tender.


Arrange the wedges so that each is cut-side-down at the beginning of the cooking process.
Make sure that the squash slices are in a single layer. Do not overlap.
 Remove the squash from the oven and serve the wedges whole while still warm.

 Before you begin the adoption process, you should determine if you are really ready for a pet dog. Think about your current living conditions and ask a few questions. For example, is your living situation stable? And, are you ready to commit to a pet for the next 10-12 years?

, Give some thought to the extra pet expenses and make sure they will not bust your budget. This includes dog food, treats, toys, bedding, training class, grooming, boarding and/or pet sitting, as well as unforeseen expenses like an occasional vet visit. Many people return pets to the shelter because they cannot afford the added expenses. Make sure you know the financial responsibilities ahead of time.On average, a new pet will cost you at least $1,000 in the first year and $500 each subsequent year you own it.

You may want to bring roommates, parents, children, spouses or partners with you to the shelter, so that they can be a part of this fun process. If you rent, be sure to contact your landlord about their policies. Aldo, if you already have a dog, bring them along to make sure that they are friendly with the new dog.Consider if anyone living with you is allergic to dogs.

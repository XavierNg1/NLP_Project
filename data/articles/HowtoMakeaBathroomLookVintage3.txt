 A crystal chandelier can give your bathroom an elegant appearance, but make sure you choose a small fixture that does not overwhelm the space. Chandeliers predate the days of electricity, but even after electric chandeliers replaced their candlelit counterparts, they served as a desirable mark of high-class luxury.
 Globe fixtures, votives, and boxy lanterns are all potential lighting options if you decide against a chandelier. The fixtures should have noticeable metal settings, and you should completely skip bright bar lights that contain multiple bulbs in one fixture.
 White plastic and painted wood creates a more contemporary appearance. Varnished wood highlights the natural beauty of the wood and would have been far more common in vintage bathrooms, especially during the Craftsman era.
 Cabinets were somewhat rare in the earliest bathrooms, especially during the Victorian era. Instead of using cabinets, you can store your products on shelves. Polished wood and marble shelves look especially vintage.
 Early bathrooms rarely included cabinets or sinks with built-in mirrors. The mirror can be full-length or half-length, but the more ornate the surrounding metal frame is, the more antique it will look.
 If you want to give your bathroom an extra “oomph,” pour your soaps, shampoos, and lotions out of their modern plastic containers and into antique glass jars.
 If you have a large enough bathroom, an antique-style chair may be just what you need to complete your vintage look. Choose a simple chair with a linen-lined seat and back on a basic wooden frame, like a Louis XV style chair. Chairs have the added bonus of acting as another surface for you to store your linens on.

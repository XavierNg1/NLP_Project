 If you want to volunteer with UNHCR in a host country, you’ll need to register as a volunteer on their online portal at https://www.unv.org/become-volunteer/volunteer-abroad/register-our-global-talent-pool. The organization administrators will match up your availability, your specific skills, and your preferences with an opportunity they think is right for you.Be sure to indicate that you are interested in volunteering abroad on your registration profile.
 Even though you are probably anxious to begin your volunteering work, you’ll need to wait for a response from the organization before you can start. Once you submit your application, simply wait until you are contacted with an offer. The length of time you’ll need to wait varies, depending on current needs.Once you receive your assignment, you have the option to accept or reject it. Take some time to review the offer and make a reasoned decision.
International volunteer assignments typically last 6-12 months, but can usually be extended up to four years.
 Once you have accepted an assignment, you’ll need to prepare for your absence. You should do some research about your host country to familiarize yourself with some of the cultural differences before you arrive.Preparing also means getting any necessary vaccinations, putting your finances in order, calling your banks to let them know you will be traveling abroad, and making preparations for a long absence from your home (especially if you have pets or housemates that you need to arrange care for).
Volunteers are typically paid a living wage while they are abroad.

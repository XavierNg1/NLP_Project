 If you have only basic data on your computer (no saved passwords, no financial data, no sensitive pictures or documents, etc.), you can use this basic method for removing most data by formatting the drive. Be aware that a skilled person may be able to recover some of this information. The necessary CD or DVD is either a Windows operating system CD (such as Windows Vista) or the system restore CD that came from the manufacturer. Turn off the computer.;
, Wait for a prompt that says "press any key to boot from CD" and hit a key. If there is no such option, you will need to enter the BIOS settings as described below:


Restart the computer if there is no prompt to boot to CD. The first screen will give the function key to hit to get into the bios. Press this key.
Look for an option to change the boot order. This will vary depending on the bios manufacturer.
Select this option, and set the computer's boot order to boot from the CD drive first.
Save the settings, exit BIOS setup and restart the computer. Press a key to boot from CD when prompted.
 At the prompt that asks where to install Windows, choose the existing Windows installation (usually C:Windows).
 Choose the option to delete the partition.
 If there is more than one partition, delete each one. At this point, the drive is clean. Continue on to create and format a new partition and install Windows. If the computer is to be discarded, remove the CD and turn off the computer.

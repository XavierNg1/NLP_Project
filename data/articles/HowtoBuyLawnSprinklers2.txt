 These sprinklers are made from a metal tube that contains several holes along the length of the tube. It is connected to two plastic ends and a plastic base. The tubing moves back and forth watering the lawn in a rectangle.


Oscillating sprinklers are very popular, but they break easily. They are also hard to set level on the lawn.
You can adjust oscillating sprinklers to water with a longer or shorter path of water. You can adjust the water pressure by adjusting the amount of water that you release through the hose.

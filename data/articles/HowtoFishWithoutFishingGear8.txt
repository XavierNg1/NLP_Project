 Thread a very strong string through the middle.
 Dangle the bright red wax in the water. The size can be adjusted depending on the intended target fish's size.
, You can use an empty thread spool attached to the branch with rubber bands to manually reel in the line, in which case, tie the line to the spool.
 Boil the fish, cool them, and smoke them over a candle/fire to dry.

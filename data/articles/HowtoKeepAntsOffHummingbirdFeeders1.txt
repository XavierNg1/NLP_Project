 An ant moat is a small cup. You place it between the feeder and the tree branch the feeder hangs from. Ants are unable to go through the water and get into the feeder. You can buy a moat and attach it to your feeder, following the instructions. If you don't already have a hummingbird feed, buy one with an ant moat already installed., Take a sticky substance, such as vaseline, and spread it on the outside of the feeder. Ants will be unable to crawl through this substance to get to the nectar., Fishing line tends to be very slippery. Ants have a difficult time moving across fishing wire. Hanging the hummingbird feeder from fishing line will make it harder for ants to get to the feeder.

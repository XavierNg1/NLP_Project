 Rabbits are highly sociable creatures, so an important part of keeping your rabbit happy and entertained is keeping her with at least one other friendly rabbit. Getting the right combination is important. A neutered male and neutered female that are the same breed and about the same size often works best.


If your rabbit is left alone for extended periods she may develop some unusual behaviours and become generally less happy., When you are providing rabbit companionship you should take care to introduce them gradually and monitor them closely. Rabbits who have been brought up together from an early age will generally get along, but there can be problems if they meet for the first time as adults.


Speak to a vet or animal behaviourist if you are unsure what to do and your rabbits keep fighting., One way to try to get a good match is to let your rabbit meet potential companions before you decide which one to take. This is not always possible, but some animal rescues centres might let you bring your rabbit with you and place her in a pen with some other rabbits to see how they react. How the rabbits get along in a bonding session can influence your decision about which one to adopt.


If you are trying a bonding session, just put your existing rabbit in a pen with another rabbit of similar size.
Make sure it is a neutral space with plenty of toys and treats for them play with.
Be sure to keep a close eye on them to see how they respond to each other and react quickly if they do not get along.

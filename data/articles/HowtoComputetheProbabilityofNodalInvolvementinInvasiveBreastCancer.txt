Useful tables can be found in the medical literature. Call this probability the prior probability. See Table 6 in and Table 1 below which is a modification of Table 6 of by Professor Howell Tong (London School of Economics), see for details.

, We may use the following values which are based on the conservative end of the range given in Table 1 of .

0.03




, Then apply the following formula: Posterior probability with a sample of n nodes which are all clear = FN(n) x prior probability / (1 - prior probability + FN(n) x prior probability). For small FN(n) x prior probability, which is usually the case, the posterior probability is approximately equally to FN(n) x prior probability / (1 - prior probability), i.e. False negative probability x odds (of nodal involvement).


Alternatively, use Table 1 to obtain a prediction before axillary sampling and then Table 2 to obtain your prediction after axillary sampling. Table 2 does not apply to samples that produce one or more positive nodes.
Example: Suppose the patient's breast tumour has size 1.6 centimeter (0.6Â in). with no lymphovascular invasion and she discovered it by her feeling the lump herself. Reading off from Table 1, the prior probability of nodal involvement is equal to 0.2. Suppose 5 axillary nodes have been removed from her by the surgeon and all the nodes are found to be clear. Then because FN(5)=0.05, the posterior probability of nodal involvement = 0.05 x 0.2 / (1-0.2 + 0.05 x 0.2 ) = 0.0123=1.23%. The approximate formula gives 1.25%.

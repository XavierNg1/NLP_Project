, After passing the long written exam, head to the next room and talk with Darwin, the studying man. Darwin will explain the basics of creating potions, which will be useful when you get to advance your job to Alchemist. After talking with Darwin, you will be asked to gather some items to proceed to the next test.

Buy 5 Mini Furnaces while you are in the Blacksmith Guild for another part of the quest. You can buy the furnaces on the first floor of the building.
 After talking with Morgenstein and buying 5 mini furnaces, return to Al de Baran (simply use the Kafra at the south part of Geffen to teleport). Talk with Van Hellmont, and he will ask you two questions pertaining the quest you took earlier. For reference, see below:


Counteragent - Detrimindextra (1) + Alcohol (1)
Mixture - Karvodailnirol (1) + Alcohol (1)

, Van will direct you to Chief Researcher, Nicolas Flamel, in the next room. Nicolas will give you simple word puzzles, which include unscrambling names and items in Ragnarok and other words. There are four questions in each of the three sets of questions, but you're only requires to answer one of the sets:

After you have passed the exam, talk to Nicholas again and he will give you several items that are needed for the next part of the quest.
DO NOT sell or store the items he gives you. You will also be needing a few items aside from the items Nicholas gave you: 5 Coal, 5 Mini Furnaces, and 2,000z.
 With the items mentioned in step 1 above in your inventory, go to Juno to meet Bajin and Bain. You will find them inside the building in the southwestern area of Juno City. Go upstairs and then talk to the brothers, give them all the items, and they will attempt to make Gold.


This experiment fails most of the time, and you will receive a variety of items from iron ores to gold, depending on luck.
 After the experiment, head back to Al De Baran and talk with Nicholas again. He will tell you to go upstairs. At the second floor, you will meet the Master Alchemist with rainbow-colored hair to change jobs.

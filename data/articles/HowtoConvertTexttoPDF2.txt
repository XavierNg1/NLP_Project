 This is the default text editor for TXT and other text files on a Mac.
 This option will only appear in OS X 10.7 (Lion) and later.If you're using an earlier version of OS X, Click "File" → "Save As" and then select "PDF" as the file type.
 Click Save to create the new PDF file.
 Some users have reported problems with creating PDFs with TextEdit, where sometimes the resulting PDF would be blank. Deleting a few system files seems to fix the problem:Click the "Go" menu in finder and select "Go to Folder". Enter ~/Library/Preferences and press ⏎ Return.
Delete any com.apple.TextEdit.plist files. There may be multiple .plist files associated with TextEdit.
Restart TextEdit and try to create the PDF file. It should work properly now.

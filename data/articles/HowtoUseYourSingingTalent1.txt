 Doing a quick online search or browsing your local newspaper should give you enough information about whether such groups exist. You can look for the following:


Middle and/or high school choirs
Collegiate choirs
Church choirs
A Capella groups
Barbershop quartets
Community choirs
Service-based choirs;
, If you want to join the group, you will need to find out what you will need to do so. You will likely have to audition, and you might have to pay membership fees or meet certain eligibility requirements.


For example, for middle school, high school, and collegiate choirs, the participants in those need to be students at those schools. Another example would be that in order to join a church choir, you have to be a member of that church's congregation.
 Some choirs only ask candidates to do a voice placement in order to join so that the teacher or conductor knows in which voice part you belong. Others will have you do an audition, for which you will need to prepare.


You may be asked to prepare your own song, in which you should practice a song you like or come up with your own original song. Or, you might be provided with the song, and you will then have to learn it for your voice part.
Voice parts include, generally speaking, soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, and bass. Women usually sing soprano, mezzo-soprano, and alto, while men usually sing tenor, baritone, and bass. However, there is flexibility if a singer has a large range.
 Arrive to your audition early, and make sure you are prepared.


Be sure to warm up beforehand so that your vocal chords are ready.

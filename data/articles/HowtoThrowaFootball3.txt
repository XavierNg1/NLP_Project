 Bullet passes are short-range, high-speed passes. The goal when throwing a bullet is to make the ball travel as fast and in as flat of an arc as possible. Bullets are thrown during quick, short-range plays - because they are fast, they are harder to intercept, so they are especially useful when the ball needs to be thrown near a defender to reach a receiver. Bullet passes can be useful for:


Gaining several yards to convert a first down.
Scoring a touchdown on a goal line play.
Quickly getting the ball to a fast, maneuverable runner.
 Grip the back of the football comfortably over the ball's laces. Face ninety degrees away from your receiver (with throwing hand away from him). Stay light on your feet, with your forward foot pointing forward.


Don't drop back as far as you would for a Hail Mary pass. Your goal is to execute the pass as quickly as possible - look for your receiver immediately.
 Don't cock your arm behind your head, as you would for a Hail Mary - throwing the ball over your head will send it too high. Stay light on your feet, with your knees slightly bent.
 Stepping forward hard is a good, quick way to put additional momentum on the throw, since you won't usually have time or space to perform the backward-then-forward footwork like you would with a Hail Mary.
 Throwing a bullet pass should feel like throwing a punch - it's a short, powerful motion done all at once. Put lots of power into the throw to make the ball fly as quickly as possible. Throw the ball in as flat of an arc as possible - release it a split-second later than you normally would for a flatter arc.
 Because the motions involved with a bullet pass are tighter and quicker than those of other passes, you may not need to rotate your body as far as you would for a normal pass. Allow the ball to roll off of your fingers for a spiral.

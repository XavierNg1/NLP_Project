 When there are multiple options on the Apple Watch screen, turning the wheel will scroll through them. Scrolling will zoom in and out on certain screens as well, such as the Home screen or a map.
 You can use the Apple Watch screen just like you would an iPhone screen. Swipe the screen to switch between views, and tap objects to select them. Press and hold something to view additional options.
 Clicking the wheel once will return you to your Home screen, much like the Home button on your iPhone. Push it again to switch to the watch face.
 Siri is Apple's digital assistant, and accessing it on your Apple Watch is very simple. Once you've launched Siri, you can use it just like you would on your iPhone. See Use Siri for detailed instructions on getting the most out of Siri. There are two ways you can start Siri on your Apple Watch:








Press and hold the wheel button to start Siri.
Bring the watch up to your face and say "Hey, Siri."

, This will switch back and forth between the watch face and the last app you were using.
 This will display icons of people that you contact the most on your iPhone. Swipe left and right to select a different person, then select how you'd like to contact them.
 This will turn the watch completely off, which can be useful if you need to save battery.
 This will launch the Apple Pay interface. Apple Pay allows you to securely pay at supported checkout terminals using just your Apple Watch. See the Apple Pay section below for more details.
 The Apple Watch has a pressure-sensitive display, and you can usually access additional options by firmly pressing something on the screen. For example, firmly pressing an email will give you quick Delete and Reply options.

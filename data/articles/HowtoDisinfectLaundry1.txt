 When you’re disinfecting your laundry with bleach, you want to wash at the highest temperature possible. Check your items’ care labels to determine how hot the water you wash them in can be, and use that setting on your washing machine.Hot water, measuring 140 to 194 degrees Fahrenheit (60 to 90 degrees Celsius) is typically only used for white items.
Colored items should be washed in cooler water, typically measuring between 86 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit (30 to 40 degrees Celsius).
Delicate items usually should be hand washed or washed in a strictly cold water cycle.;
, Once you’ve set the proper temperature for the water, fill the cap from your detergent with the recommended amount for the size of your load. Pour the detergent directly into the washer’s drum or into the detergent drawer.If you’re not sure where the detergent goes in your washing machine, consult the operating instructions.
Front-loading washers usually have a detergent drawer, while top-loading washers usually call for pouring the detergent directly into the washer’s drum.
 Consult the instructions on the bottle of bleach to determine how much you should add for the size of your load. Next, pour the bleach into the bleach dispenser.If your washer doesn’t have a bleach dispenser, you can add the bleach directly to the drum. However, you should start the cycle first so water starts to fill the drum before pouring the bleach in. Don’t put laundry in a washer with bleach that hasn’t been diluted first.
Pay attention to the type of bleach that you’re using. Chlorine bleach is best for white items, while all-fabric bleach should be used on colored items.
 Once you’ve added the detergent and bleach, place your laundry items in the washer’s drum. Close the lid, and allow the cycle to run through as it normally would. When your items are finished washing, dry them according to their care instructions.

 Short hair is very fashionable, at the moment. Even if your hair isn’t long enough to pull up, you can still have fun with cute styles.


Try using hair gel or a texturizing spray in your hair.You can play around with it to get a slightly messy, edgy look. This looks great on both guys with shorter hair and girls with pixie cuts.
Make sure you only use a small amount of product, as you don’t want your hair to look greasy.
 Using a flat iron to straighten shorter hair is an easy way to look pretty and stylish.


It doesn’t need to be perfect. Just apply a heat protectant serum to your hair and flat iron the pieces that seem out of place or wavy.
Finish the look of with a spritz of shine enhancer. This will make sure you have pretty hair all throughout the school day.
 People with shorter hair can also look great quickly with a hair accessory or two.


Headbands look great with short hair. Try wearing a bold headband with sparkles or a wide one with bright colors.Hats are also a great option for both guys and girls with short hair. Whether it’s a baseball cap or a stylish fedora, hats are great for days when you don’t want to bother with your hair.
 Parts can make a difference in the look of short hair, too.


Try combing your hair over into a deep side part, and let your bangs sweep across your face. This will give your short haircut a softer, more romantic look.
You may have to comb a small amount of styling cream or hair gel through your hair to get your part to stay in place.

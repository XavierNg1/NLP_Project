 Asthma attacks last for about five to 10 minutes, so take a second to look at a clock and note the time. If you have not gotten your breathing back into a normal pattern within 15 minutes, then seek medical attention., Sitting upright in a chair is the best position to be in as you try to get your breathing back under control. Do not recline or lie down because this may make it harder for you to breathe., Tight fitting pants or a tight collar may restrict your breathing. Take a moment to loosen up your clothing if you feel like it is interfering with your ability to breathe., Try to relax your body and focus only on your breathing. You may find it helpful to count to five slowly as you inhale and then count back down from five as you exhale. Closing your eyes or focusing on an image or object may also help to keep you calm as you work to get your breathing back under control.As you breathe in focus on pulling air down into your stomach, then use your stomach muscles to help you push the air out. This is called diaphragmatic breathing and it will help you to take in deeper breaths.To make sure that you are taking in full deep breaths, try placing one hand on your stomach (just below your ribcage) and the other on your chest. As you breathe, you should notice that the hand on your chest is staying still while the hand below your ribcage is rising and falling.
 If after 15 minutes you are still struggling to breathe, then seek immediate medical attention. You should seek medical attention sooner if the attack is severe or if you are very uncomfortable. Some signs that you should seek emergency medical help include:Being unable to speak in full sentences
Sweating because of difficulty breathing
Breathing that is rapid
Noticing pale or blue color nail beds or skin

 As long as the weather is still warm and dry, you should let the sunflowers reach full maturity while still growing. If possible, do not cut the flower heads off before the back turns yellow-brown.

Ideally, you should wait until the sunflower loses its petals and the head droops. You might need to tie the flower head to a stake as it begins to die back, though, since the head will become heavier and the plant will begin to weaken under its own weight.
 Wrap cheesecloth around the flower heads and tie with kitchen twine. Doing so will protect the seeds from birds and squirrels.

Instead of cheesecloth, you could use a paper bag tied on with a rubber band. Either way, the material should be tied on at the base of the head and the seeds should be protected.
Wait until after the flower starts to die back before covering the flower head.
Also note that the bag can help catch seeds that dry and fall off during the drying process.
 If you need to cut the flower heads off early due to pests or climate, cut off about 1 foot (30.5 cm) of the stem along with it., Hang the sunflowers upside down in a dry, dark spot for several weeks, or until the back of the flower head turns completely brown.

Even if you bring the sunflower in early, you should still cover it with cheesecloth or a paper bag to collect the seeds and to protect those seeds against any small animals that may find their way into the shed or garage you decide to keep it in.
 Once the flowers have completely dried, you should be able to remove the seeds simply by brushing them off with your fingers or with a stiff brush.

If you have multiple sunflowers, you can also remove the seeds by rubbing two different sunflower heads together.

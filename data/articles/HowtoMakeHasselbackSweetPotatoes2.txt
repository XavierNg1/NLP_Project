 Wash 2 medium sweet potatoes and pat them dry. Use a sharp knife to carefully slice away a thin, horizontal piece off the bottom of each potato. This will give you a sturdy base to cut the potatoes. Slice down through the sweet potatoes every 1/4-inch (6.3 mm) taking care to leave 1/8-inch (3 mm) at the bottom. Turn the oven on to 425 degrees F (218 C).You can set the sweet potato between two chopsticks. This way, your knife won't be able to go all the way through the potato as you're slicing, since it will hit the chopsticks.
 Set the sweet potatoes in a baking dish and use a pastry brush to spread 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over them. Sprinkle a little salt and black pepper over them and put the pan in the oven. Bake the sweet potatoes for 30 to 40 minutes.This initial roasting time will make the sweet potatoes soft throughout the center. You may need to add cooking time, if your sweet potatoes are large.
 Take the sweet potatoes out of the oven and set them aside while you mix the maple pecan topping. Turn up the oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 C). You'll need to combine these topping ingredients in a small bowl:2 tablespoons of melted butter
1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
¼ cup (30 g) of chopped pecans
¼ cup (85 g) of maple syrup
½ teaspoon of vanilla extract
½ teaspoon of kosher salt

, Use a spoon to scoop the maple pecan topping on and inside the sweet potato slices. You may need to use the spoon to push the chopped pecans down into the sweet potatoes. Put the baking dish back in the hot oven and bake the sweet potatoes for another 8 to 10 minutes.Remove the baking dish from the oven and spoon any of the maple butter liquid back over the potatoes. Let them cool a little bit before you serve them.

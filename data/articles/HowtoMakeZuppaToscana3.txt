 While cooking times may vary, the method for cooking most vegan sausages is similar. Put your vegan sausage in a skillet.
Heat the sausage on high.
Cook through for approximately 5 minutes.
Vegan sausage doesn't take nearly as long to cook as regular meat sausage. With this product, you aren't waiting for meat to brown and cook through.
The goal is brown the sausage quickly. If you cook it too long it can become very mushy and grainy in texture.
 You can do this with a knife or food processor. If using a knife, dice the onion and garlic into fine pieces.
Using a very sharp knife will help this process go quickly and smoothly.
If you are using a food processor, pulse these ingredients until they are finely chopped.
 These will need to be in smaller pieces so they can cook quickly.


Use a sharp knife to cut the potatoes.
Chop them into 1/2 inch sized pieces.
Leave the skins on the potatoes.
 Stir these together in a large, heavy saucepan. Cook this mixture on medium heat.
You will want to cook this soup base until the potatoes are soft.
This will take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes.
 Stir the soup well. Let the soup simmer with the bacon bits and spices for about 10 minutes.
The soup should simmer on low heat.
Stir occasionally during this step.
 You will only be using the leaves of the kale in this recipe. Save the stems for juicing or smoothies rather than waste them.
Rip up the kale into bite sized pieces.
Rinse these thoroughly and dry in a salad spinner.
 The soup should still be on low heat.Stir the soup thoroughly to make sure the almond milk is mixed in.
Heat on low until the kale has wilted and become dark green in color.
Serve the soup while its hot in large bowls with a side of toast.

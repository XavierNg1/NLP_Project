 Helicopters are the second fastest way to get around the game. Helicopters can be found on GTA Online only in specific areas:


Police station roofs
Hospital roofs
Airports

, Approach a helicopter at the locations mentioned above and press the triangle (for PS4) or the Y button (for Xbox 360) on your controller to get in.
 After getting in the helicopter, press and hold the R2 (for PS4) or the Right Trigger button (for Xbox 360) on the top of the controller to take off. Keep pressing this button until you reach your desired height.
 Once you’ve reached your desired altitude, use the arrow keys to move around the sky and fly to where you need to go.
 Once you’ve reached your destination, press and hold the L2 (for PS4) or the Left Trigger button (for Xbox 360) to slowly descend. Use the left analog stick while the helicopter is descending to help you steer to your desired landing spot.

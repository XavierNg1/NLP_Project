 Signs and symptoms of the infection depend on where the infection is located and the number of cysticerci in the body.


Cysticerci in the muscles:
In most cases there are no symptoms when cysticerci are located in the muscles. However you may feel bumps under the skin.


Cysticerci in the eyes:
This infection is rare. If this does occur, cysticerci float in the eye and cause blurred or disrupted vision. Infection may also cause swelling or detachment of the retina.


Cysticerci in the brain, spinal cord (neurocysticercosis):
The most common symptoms are headaches and seizures. Disorientation, lack of awareness to the environment or other people, inadequate equilibrium, and swelling of the brain (hydrocephalus) can also occur.

;
,, Surgery may be required to treat infection in the eyes, in cases that do not respond to drug treatment, or to reduce swelling of the brain.

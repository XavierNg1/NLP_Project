 You will need one skewer for each kebab. Soak as many as you need in a bowl of water for ten minutes. This will prevent the wood from charring when you grill the kebabs.









If you prefer to use metal skewers, those will also work fine. They do not need to be soaked.
 Fruit kebabs should be grilled over even, medium-high heat. Use an electric or charcoal grill.









A stovetop grill will also work will for grilling kebabs.
If you don't have a grill, the kebabs can be cooked under the broiler in your oven. Light it to high in preparation for cooking the kebabs.
 Dragon fruit pairs well with any type of tropical fruit. For these kebabs, try mango and pineapple.









Cut a ripe dragon fruit in half. Scoop out the flesh and slice it into bite-sized chunks.
Cut a ripe mango in half. Remove the skin and slice it into bite-sized chunks.
Cut a pineapple in half. Slice off the skin and then slice the flesh into bite-sized chunks.
 Alternate fruits so you have equal amounts of each fruit on the skewers. Leave space on either end for lifting the kebabs.
 Cook them until they are lightly browned on one side, then turn them over to cook the other side.









If you're using a broiler, place them on a baking sheet and put them in the oven. Allow them to cook for 2 minutes, then remove them from the oven, turn them over, and place them back in the oven to cook for another 2 minutes.
 Place them on a serving dish and serve immediately with a bowl of sugar for sprinkling.

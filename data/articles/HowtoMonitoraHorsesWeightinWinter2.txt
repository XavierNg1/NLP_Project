 In order to get an accurate understanding of changes to the horse's weight over time, you will need to measure it on a regular basis. If you are very concerned about a horse's weight, this can be every week. If you think the horse is maintaining weight fine, then every couple of weeks should be fine.Use the same type of weight measurement every time you measure the horse. This is the only way to really assess changes in weight over time.
 When a horse is in the cold during the winter, it can grow a thick winter coat. This can interfere with weight tape measurements and condition scoring. With this coat change in mind, try to be consistent with the pressure and placement of weight tape and how you feel the horse's body when condition scoring.If you focus on consistency, any changes you document will usually signal a real trend in weight change.
Be sure to remove a horseâ€™s blanket daily to assess weight gain or loss.
 To track the horse's weight, you will need to know what its weight was before the winter. Then, you will need to keep a record of its weight throughout the winter.


Be sure that you measure the horse's weight the same way every time. For instance, if you use a horse tape to measure the weight in the Fall, then use it to make subsequent measurements.

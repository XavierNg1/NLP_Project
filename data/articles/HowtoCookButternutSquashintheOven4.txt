 Prepare a 9- by 13-inch (23- by 33-cm) glass baking dish.


Greasing the dish or covering it with aluminum foil is unnecessary.
 Use a sharp serrated knife to divide the squash in half lengthwise.

Cut the squash in half from top to bottom.






Peeling is not necessary or desired.






Scoop out the seeds and pulp with a metal spoon or melon-baller.
 The halves should be cut-side down. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) cool to lukewarm water to the dish.


The water helps to prevent the squash from sticking and also creates steam, which aids in the cooking process.
 Tightly cover the top of the dish with aluminum foil.


If using nonstick foil, make sure that the nonstick side faces down toward the squash.






Pinch the foil around the edges of the baking dish to ensure a tight seal.
 The squash should be tender enough to poke with a fork after it finishes.


You may not notice any change in color.
 If desired, scoop out the softened flesh and place it into a large bowl. Use a potato masher to mash brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon into the squash.


Wait several minutes after pulling the squash out of the oven before handling it.






You can also serve the squash without mashing it. Simply divide the squash into quarters or however many pieces you desire. Sprinkle it with brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon, or try different seasonings, like salt and pepper.

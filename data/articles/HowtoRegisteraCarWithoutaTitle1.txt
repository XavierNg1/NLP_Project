 The information you will need to get your vehicle titled varies from state to state.

Here you’ll find downloadable paperwork, as well as helpful phone numbers and addresses for offices you may need to visit.
Expect to fill out an application (to either transfer or replace a title), and have information such as the vehicle's VIN number, odometer reading, and a bill of sale.;
, If you have a car without a title, get in touch with the previous owner to determine whether they still have the title. Whenever a car changes ownership, the title should be transferred as well. If you are unable to get the title transferred, getting a new title will be more challenging., The easiest way to get your vehicle title is by finding the previous owner and going over the necessary paperwork together. The paperwork will vary from state to state. If possible, visit a state office together with the vehicle to fill out all of the paperwork and complete the transfer process.Do not make changes to an existing title. The title holder will complete paperwork indicating transfer of ownership and you will be issued a new title.
There cannot be an outstanding loan against a vehicle while transferring the title, unless the transfer is approved by the lender.
The odometer reading (at time of transfer) and VIN numbers on the vehicle must match those in the paperwork.

 Before you wash the bottle, always remove the cap. You can wash the cap separately by hand, or place it in the dishwasher with the bottle. If you place the bottle in the dishwasher with the cap on, it will not get clean all the way.
 Whether you wash the bottle by hand or in the dishwasher, always remove the filter first. Excessively hot water can damage the filter or release particles from it, which reduces its effectiveness.Set the filter somewhere clean while you wash the bottle to avoid contaminating it.
 Brita water bottles are designed to withstand washing in the dishwasher, but it’s important to only wash them on the top rack. The top rack tends to be better for plastic. Place the bottle so the opening faces down., If your dishwasher has a temperature setting, make sure it does not exceed the specified temperature. If there is no temperature setting, check the dishwasher’s manual for temperature specifications.If you cannot determine your dishwasher’s water temperature, you may want to stick with washing your water bottle by hand to avoid avoid damaging it.
 If your dishwasher does not dry the bottle enough, set it upside down on a drying rack or on a clean towel and allow it to air dry. If you need to dry the bottle in a hurry, opt for a paper towel or microfiber towel to avoid leaving cloth fibers in the bottle.

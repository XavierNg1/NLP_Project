 Gather everyone's gaming systems and all the necessary controllers, cords, etc, in one place. Depending on what systems you're using, make sure your devices are fully charged or you have outlets to plug them in, as well as any required televisions. Prepare some snacks to eat throughout the night, too.;
, For a full and fun gaming event, you'll probably want to game late into the night ,so make sure you don't have any big obligations like school or work the next day. Saturday nights are ideal.
 If you need parental permission to have your own solo gaming night, or host a gaming night with others, ask them. Make sure your friends get permission, too.
 Which games are you going to play first? How long are turns going to take? You don't need to stick to a rigid schedule, but getting some idea of whether each person can play for 20 minutes or 3 hours before switching will help things run smoothly.
 All-night gaming can be a blast, but take the opportunity to relax with your friends, eat some good snacks, and get some rest, too.
 If you're bored with video games, try another kind of game: board games, card games, and so on can be just as fun, and more interactive. Take a break from the screen and dive into another kind of game.

 Most experts agree that this is 90 percent of the solution to reducing total body fat. Exercising alone will not work.
 In other words, stay away from highly processed flours, sugar and other foods that have few nutrients and high calories.
, The fats in olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds and many other whole grains actually help you to lose belly fat. Keep serving sizes relatively low, but eat them at every meal.
 High-protein, low-fat Greek yogurt is an excellent choice to improve weight loss. Replace another snack with a low-sugar 4 to 6 oz. cup of yogurt with fruit.
 This is 8 to 12 8 oz. glasses of water, green tea, coffee or other healthy, low-calorie drinks. Soda, fruit juice, or dairy drinks should not count, so reduce your consumption of liquid calories.
 It is not necessary that you cut out all fats or carbohydrates, but you should reduce portion sizes for maximum impact.

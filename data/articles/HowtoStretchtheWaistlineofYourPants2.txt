 Pull them up as far as you can—if you can zip or button them all the way, you’ll be able to stretch them better.


If you’re struggling to get the pants all the way on, try laying down while buttoning/zipping the pants—it can make them easier to get into.
 Use warm water to fill a spray bottle and spray the waistband until it’s thoroughly damp.
 Squat down, do lunges, pull each leg up to your chest, or do any other movements that will help pull and stretch the dampened waistline of the pants. Do this until the waist has reached the desired level of stretch.


But be careful not to go so far that you tear the pants.
 Wear the pants until they’re dry so that the stretch will hold.

 Wear thick socks, or several pairs of thin socks. Pull on the shoes over the socks.;
, Turn on a hairdryer, set it to the highest setting, and hold it several inches (10+ centimeters) away from the shoes. Warm the whole shoe, but focus on the areas that feel tightest. Keep heating until the shoe feels warm and slightly flexible to the touch. This can take anywhere from 10 seconds to 3 minutes, depending on the shoe and the power of your hairdryer.


Overheating can damage your shoe or leave marks. Keep the hairdryer at the recommended distance to avoid this.
 Turn off the hairdryer. Wriggle your toes and heel. Bend and stretch the outside of the shoe with your hands. Keep doing this until the shoe cools down again.
 Walk around and see if the shoe feels comfortable. Usually, you'll need to warm and bend it at least two or three times. When it seems a little stretched, take off your thick socks and try walking around in thin socks or barefoot.

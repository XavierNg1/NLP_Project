 "Sangrita" means "little blood" in Spanish, called this way because of the color of the liquid. The Sangrita is non-alcoholic. In a separate cup, mix together and refrigerate:


1 cup fresh-squeezed orange juice
1 oz fresh-squeezed lime juice
1 tsp grenadine
12 dashes hot sauce (Cholula is best)

,, Traditionally, this is what sangrita is served with, although tequila reposado can also pair with sangrita.
 Native Mexicans tend not to shoot their tequila, preferring instead to sip it.
 This combination gets its name because the three shots each represent one color of the Mexican flag â€” red, white, and green.

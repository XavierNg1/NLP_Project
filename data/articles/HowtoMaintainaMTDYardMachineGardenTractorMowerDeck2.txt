 Prior to reassembly, perform any necessary periodic maintenance to the deck assembly such as replacement of blades, belts, or bearings. Clean any debris or entangled material from the spindles and blades. Perform any necessary lubrication to linkages, brackets, and insure that all springs used on the deck are in good operating condition.
 Reassembly of the mowing deck and re-mounting onto the tractor is opposite of the above procedures. Insure that all components designated by the OEM have been either reinstalled or replaced as necessary.

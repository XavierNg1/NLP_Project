 Include any necessary titles. You can probably skip titles for close friends and family members, but you might consider including them for government officials, military personnel, doctors, professors or elderly people. This could be a person or an organization.
 It's important that you write the number first and the street second. For example: 10 Downing St.
 For example: London.
 If, for instance, you're sending a letter to London, you probably don't need to write the county. But if you're sending a letter to a rural area, including it might be a good idea. If you know any other principal subdivisions, such as the province, state, or county, then include that as well., For example: SWIA 2AA.
 If you're posting the letter from outside of Great Britain, write "UK" or "United Kingdom" on the last line.

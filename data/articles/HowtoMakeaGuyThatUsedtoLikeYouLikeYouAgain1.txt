 It's inevitable that you will spend some time thinking about the guy who used to like you too, but you can control how you spend that time. Imagine how it will be and what it will feel like when you do win him back. Envision this as a future memory and not a distant one. Positive thinking goes much further than you often realize.;
, This is often easier said than done when you're trying to win back someone who rejected you. However, appearing sad or desperate is a guaranteed way NOT to win him back. Show him you are capable of moving on.
 Even though you can win back the guy who used to like you, it's not going to happen overnight. Constantly thinking about him will not do anything but cause undue stress. Take up a new hobby or devote more energy to your career and friends. In addition to having less time to focus on this guy, this will make you feel like you have regained some control of your life.

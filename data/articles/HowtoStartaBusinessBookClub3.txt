 There is a world of difference between books about starting your own business and books about climbing your way up the corporate ladder in an existing business. Likewise, someone interested in reading about improving sales may not be as interested in reading about how to manage subordinates. Decide what books your club will focus on before you start and let potential members know before they decide to join.
 Ask your members for book suggestions. As the leader, you can have the final say about whether or not each suggestion will be taken. Alternatively, you can put each request up for a vote or allow each member to take a turn selecting a book without taking any vote.
 The Internet is a valuable resource. Use it to find out about the business books that have grabbed the attention of professionals everywhere. If so many people are interested in a book, the information it contains may be worth adding to your own information bank.
 Instead of choosing the next book to read immediately before having to read it, determine a roster of books several months in advance. That way, members have plenty of time to research what the book is about and to grab a copy of it.
 As the leader of the group, it is your job to get the ball rolling. Mention a few key points you found interesting or a handful of ideas you feel skeptical about. Ask questions that cannot be answered with a simple “yes” or “no,” and offer opinions that are open enough to be debated.
 A business book club is not a lecture, after all. Make sure that anyone who has a question or idea has the opportunity to voice it. If your members are exceptionally quiet from meeting to meeting, you may consider twisting their arm a little by requesting that everyone bring at least one discussion question to each meeting.

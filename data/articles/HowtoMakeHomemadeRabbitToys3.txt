 Some rabbits enjoy shredding fabric, while others simply enjoy bunching and "sorting" fabrics. An old hand towel or a couple of wash cloths would allow your rabbit to bunch and tear as much as he likes. Just be sure that your rabbit doesn't eat the fabric, as it could make him sick or create a choking hazard., Once you've removed the front and back covers of a phone book, your rabbit can shred, bunch, and sort scraps of paper from the phone book. Rabbits should only play with phone books under close adult supervision, however, as you'll want to be sure your pet doesn't eat any of the adhesive along the spine of the phone book., The tube inside a roll of paper towel or toilet paper can make an excellent toy for rabbits to shred. It's soft enough that it will be easy to tear, yet thick enough that it will provide some resistance. For even better results, stuff a cardboard tube with hay or shredded paper and hide treats in the middle. Your rabbit will shred and tear, and will eventually find a reward inside!

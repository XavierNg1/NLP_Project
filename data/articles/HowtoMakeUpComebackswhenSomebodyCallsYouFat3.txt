 While sarcastic comments are okay, especially when you're being harassed, make sure not to bait someone into an argument. Stick to a brief, witty comeback over insulting the person.Yelling at the person or calling them names in return is unlikely to resolve the situation. Try to keep your cool, even if you're upset.
 It's okay to be sad after someone calls you fat. It's natural for the comment to sting a little. Seek support from people who care about you.Find a trusted friend or family member to vent to. Try making plans to do something fun, like see a movie, with friends if you're reeling from the comment.
Choose someone who's empathetic and a good listener.
 A comment about your weight can leave you feeling bad about yourself. After being on the receiving end of a negative comment about your weight, try to think about everything you like about yourself. Remember all the positive things people have said about you instead of focusing on a solitary negative comment.Try making a list. Write down every nice thing anyone has ever said to you. Refer to that instead of focusing on the negative comment about your weight.
 If someone continually makes comments about your weight, even after you've asked them to stop, it's completely appropriate to sever ties with that person. It is never okay to continually criticize someone for their weight, and it's certainly not okay to call someone fat. If someone keeps violating your boundaries, it's okay to walk away.If the offender is a family member, this can be difficult. If your dad, for example, consistently makes comments about your weight, it may be hard to stay away from him. However, you can take a short break from the negative situation. You could excuse yourself and go to your room for a few minutes if your dad makes a comment about your weight.

 This is a messy method meant for messy cupcakes, so a bowl is preferable to a plate.


This method is rarely used when eating a cupcake in good condition. Instead, this method works best for cupcakes that are otherwise inedible because they are too crumbly or because the frosting is too runny.
 Press down onto the cupcake using the tines (the pointy part) of the fork, smashing the cake down until it is completely broken apart.
 Stir the crumbled cake pieces and the frosting until clumps of sticky cupcake goodness form.


You will need a sufficient amount of frosting to make this work. If your cupcake is lacking in frosting and you cannot get it to clump up, consider adding more frosting or a dollop of jam or similarly sticky spread to the crumbled up cupcake.
 Pick up the clumps of cupcake with your fork and eat them that way. If the clumps fall apart when you stick your fork through them, switch to a spoon.

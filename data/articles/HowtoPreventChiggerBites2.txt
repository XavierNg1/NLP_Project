 Within 3 to 6 hours of a chigger biting you, the signs and symptoms will appear. The symptoms include red welts, itching, swelling, and fever. While the symptoms usually go away within 1 week, scratching the welts will prolong the length of time you will experience these symptoms. Avoid scratching the welts to ensure a quick recovery.


If you break the skin, your risk of contracting a secondary infection increases.
 Chigger bites are extremely itchy. To combat your desire to scratch, apply an over the counter anti-itch cream, such as menthol or calamine lotion. Antihistamine pills can also provide temporary itch relief.


When you apply anti-itch cream or take an antihistamine pill, always follow the product instructions., When applied directly to bites, cold compresses can provide temporary relief from itching. Wrap ice in a thin towel. Hold the compress against the affected area for 10 minutes at a time. Space out the use of the compress to prevent skin damage., Chigger bites typically do not require any medical attention.However, if your symptoms linger or worsen, call a doctor immediately. Contact a medical professional if you experience:


Shortness of breath
Fever
Dizziness, weakness, or fainting
Headache, chills, joint aches, and or vomiting

 If you don't have a cookie sheet, a baking dish will also work. If you use a baking dish, don't worry about using aluminum foil.









Aluminum foil also keeps you from worrying about clean up and lets you concentrate on the impending deliciousness in front of you. Double win.
 Use 1 to 2 tbsp. (15 to 30 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil to start. If it's not enough, add more until they each get a thin coating.









Do this in the pan! No point in dirtying another dish. When you drizzle on the olive oil, just roll them around with a fork. Try to get the olive oil evenly disbursed throughout.
 You want them to roast as evenly as possible. If they're bunched on top of each other, they'll cook at different rates.
 If you have kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, even better. The fresher your seasonings, the more the taste will come alive.









Minced garlic is also a welcome addition to any roasted asparagus plate. If you like the taste of garlic, add in a few finely chopped cloves.
 Cook the spears for 8 to 10 minutes. If you're working with thick spears or a hefty load, you may need more time. Keep an eye on it and issue a taste test at around 10 minutes.









It's best to place the pan of asparagus on the middle rack. The heat circulates most evenly at the center of the oven.
Halfway through the cooking time, turn the asparagus with a fork or by shaking the pan.
Some recipes call for as long as 25 minutes in the oven.It all depends on the width and number of your stalks.

 A black widow's web is typically irregular in shape. The threads are strong and look a bit thicker than other spider webs. The webs look like they are tangled up, though they are constructed with precision. The black widowâ€™s web generally has a diameter of approximately one foot (30 cm)., Black widows generally like to live in dry and dark hiding spots. They are often found in corners, meter boxes, cellars, wood stacks, garages, between buildings, and under rocks. They will be in almost any crevice.Black widows live in primarily warm climates and can be found on every continent except for Antarctica. However, they prefer locations within 45 degrees of the equator.
 Black widows have a very unique way that they rest in their webs. At night, they spend most of their time hanging upside down in the web, waiting to capture prey. During the day, they will probably be in hiding.

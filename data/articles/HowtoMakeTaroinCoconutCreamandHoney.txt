 Wash the taro to remove all traces of dirt.;
,, Boil the taro until the soft.
 Once the taro is ready, drain out the water and put the taro in a bowl whilst you work on making the coconut and honey cream.
 Scrape out the juicy white flesh and place it into a bowl.


Do not add water to the scrapings.
 Twist the edges in opposite directions so that the juices can be squeezed out. Extract as much coconut cream from the scrapings as you can.
 Put it on the stove at lower heat.
 At this point, add 3 to 4 tablespoons of honey.
 Remove the cream from the heat once thickened.
 Mix gently to ensure that all surfaces of the taro have been coated in the cream.
 To complete the presentation of the taro in coconut and honey cream, grate a handful of chopped shallots and sprinkle them over the surface of the taro. Serve immediately.

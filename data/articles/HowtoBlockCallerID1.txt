 Phone providers in North America offer a *67 feature for landlines and (many) cell phones that prevents your information from being shown on the receiver’s display. This only works on a per-call basis, and you have to dial *67 before every blocked call you want to make. Using a temporary blocking code may also allow you to make calls to phones that have blocked your number.


To use this feature, most providers simply require you dial *67, followed by the 10-digit number (the area code plus the number) you are calling.
Some providers, such as Xfinityand Bell,will provide a confirmation beep or tone after you dial *67, so wait for the regular dial tone to return before dialing the 10-digit number you wish to call.
For those wishing to temporarily block their phone number from being seen on an iPhone on the Verizon network, use this trigger before dialing the number to block your number from being seen on the recipient's phone's caller ID box. As you'll learn later, setting up permanent block with Verizon is done through their web interface and can become a nuisance. Other branded iPhones come with Block Caller ID settings in the settings app that can work, but Verizon's iPhones work differently and don't come with these and *67 works wonders.;
, This feature works that same as *67, but will work for different cell phones in North America. This code also works on mobile devices in many other countries, including New Zealand,Australia, and GSM (Global System for Mobile) phones in Europe., Many countries offer a service for landlines that’s similar to *67 that works on a per-call basis. Dial the particular code that's specific to the country you're in before dialing the rest of the phone number.

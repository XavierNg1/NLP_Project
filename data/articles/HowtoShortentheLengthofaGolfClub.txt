 Place a towel or clothes underneath your vice grip.;
, Put the club into the vice such that the grip end of the club is pointing at you.
 With a utility knife, carefully make a cut along the grip. Remove the grip and dispose of it in the garbage.
 Underneath the grip, you will find tape. Remove this by peeling it off.
 With the measuring tape, measure the desired length to be cut off. This distance should be taken from the top of the club. Mark the length. Use a permanent marker to mark where the cut should be made.
 Using the hack saw, carefully cut the club where you marked it. Be sure keep fingers away from blade for your safety.
 The metal you just cut will be hot so set it aside for several minutes and allow to cool down., Take the sand paper and carefully smooth the end of the shaft. It will be sharp, and you do not want to rip the new grip that you will put on later.
 Put the new grip along the shaft to see how far down it will extend. This is how far you want the tape to go on each side.
 This will lubricate the tape so you can easily slide the grip over it. This solvent will dry up and become a sticky glue.
 Hold your finger to the tee-sized hole at the end of grip and spray the solvent into the other end. Shake this around to lubricate the inside of the grip.
 With your finger still holding all the solvent liquid inside the grip, slide the big hole onto the shaft.
 In order for the tape and solvent to fully set, allow time for it to dry.

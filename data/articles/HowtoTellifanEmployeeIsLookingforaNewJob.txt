 Work assignments not being completed in a timely fashion, unreturned voicemails or emails, and lack of initiative to take on new projects could be indications an employee is no longer committed to the job.;
, While employers can not deny sick days or ask employees to report to work, they should be aware if patterns are forming. An employee could be using sick time to interview. Eric Neely, a hiring manager, has had his share of turnover in his career, “I once had an employee call in sick three days in a row with a bad case of the stomach flu. On the fourth day he resigned via phone. He had accepted a position with another company. Needless to say, the entire office felt a little sick from his actions.”

, If business casual attire becomes strictly business attire, you may be looking at a person going to an interview. When asked why he or she is dressed up, the reply is something like: “Didn’t get around to laundry this week.” A typical interview last between 45 minutes to an hour. If the suspicious employee combines the Navy suit with a long lunch or doctor’s appointment there is a 90% chance he is looking for another job.
 Media, 32.3% of men between the ages of 25 and 34 said they spend three or more hours a day on the Internet at work. If every time you walk by an employee’s cube they either quickly block the computer screen with their body or minimize the page they were viewing, there is a good chance they want to avoid you seeing the monster.com homepage.
 This is a no-brainer. If an employee constantly complains about co-workers, their job responsibilities, and having to come to work Monday-Friday, there is a good chance they do not see themselves with the company for a long time.
 This doesn't necessarily indicate they are job-searching, but could be a strong possibility.

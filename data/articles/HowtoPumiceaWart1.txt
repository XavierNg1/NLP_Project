 Most wart removal methods require you to soften the skin around the wart before applying any other treatment. This makes the calloused area easier to remove. Start by soaking the wart and surrounding areas in a hot water bath for ten to fifteen minutes prior to removal., While the calloused skin surrounding the wart is still soft from soaking, use a pumice stone or another abrasive surface like an emery board to file down the dead skin. Use a gentle scrubbing or back-and-forth motion to take off the top, whitish layer of skin.Do not pumice too hard or too much. The pumice should not hurt, and you should stop once you buff away the dead skin. Stop if you feel any pain, irritation, or discomfort.
Do not share a pumice stone with others, as this could lead to infection.
 Pumicing, alone, will not get rid of a wart. After pumicing, apply a salicylic acid treatment formulated especially for wart removal. These are available over the counter in both liquid and patch form from most pharmacies and drug stores.If you use a liquid treatment, you may opt to apply a bandage after you apply the treatment to keep the area covered and the acid contained.
 Treating a wart by pumicing and applying acid can take time. Repeat the treatment daily until the wart has disappeared. If the wart is not gone after 12 weeks, contact your doctor to see if continuing treatment is advised.

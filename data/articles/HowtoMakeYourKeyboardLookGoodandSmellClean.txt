 Be aware that the wipe or washcloth should not be dripping wet, but dampened enough to remove dirt and grime. Make sure that you get into all of the cracks and corners.;
, Gently rub it over the keyboard. If you do not have a vacuum cleaner or a small attachment, then you can use a Q-tip and rub it in and out of the cracks of your keyboard to remove dust. Another great way is to use and old toothbrush or paint brush instead of a Q-Tip because they both can clean better.
 This will make your keyboard smell great while your typing and it lasts a very long time.

 This is perhaps the most common way to cook a turkey breast.


Place the breast in a roasting pan and add liquid such as chicken broth, wine or water to the bottom of the pan.
Cover the roasting pan loosely with aluminum foil while it cooks. This will allow the skin on the turkey breast to brown and keep the meat moist.
Roast for 20 minutes per pound. For example, a 5 pound (2.26 kg) turkey breast will take one hour and 40 minutes to cook.



Place the turkey breast on the grill and lower the grill cover. This will evenly cook your turkey and prevent heat flare-ups.
Flip the turkey breast with tongs or a spatula. Do not use a knife or a fork, otherwise you will pierce the meat and allow liquid to come out. This could result in dry turkey.
Check internal temperature with a meat thermometer. Grilling turkey breast will always result in a darkened skin, so it can be hard to accurately determine when the turkey is done cooking. Make sure the thermometer reads 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73.8 Celsius).
 This will provide a unique flavor for your turkey.


Follow the directions on your smoker. Most smokers are charcoal, electric or gas, and your cooking instructions will depend on which kind you have.
Make sure you do not use a stuffed turkey breast in your smoker. It may not cook well, and smoked stuffing does not often have a pleasant taste.
 Deep fried turkey is often good at keeping the meat moist.


Use an outdoor propane fryer or an indoor electric fryer.
Heat the oil in the fryer and put the turkey breast into the oil for frying.
Cook for 4 to 5 minutes per pound. For example, a 5 pound (2.26 kg) turkey breast will cook for 20 to 25 minutes.

 Any time that you give a negative answer, you should prepare yourself for a negative response. Expecting your coworker to be disappointed or even angry that you said “no” will prevent you from being surprised by their response.It is important to maintain civil reactions to other coworkers even when they are aggressive toward you, so that there is no violence in the workplace.
 If your coworker becomes upset, remain calm. Do not react to them in the same way that they are acting toward you. Staying calm can also diffuse a situation. When someone gets upset, other people acting the same way adds fuel to the fire.


Practice things to stay calm like speaking slowly or even removing yourself from the room.
 Keep in mind that sometimes, people are not understanding when others say no, and they may be giving you an ultimatum. If you say no to a coworker, they may be so upset that they won’t ever be willing to work with you again. Decide ahead of time that you are OK with this.


If you know that saying no to a particular coworker will mean losing the relationship, decide how you will react to this. Will you let it go without discussing it further, or will you tell someone like your supervisor or boss what happened? If you find that you don't want to burn the bridge, perhaps you should work with the coworker to find a way to help them that works better for you.
 After you have finished an interaction where you had to say no to coworker and they reacted negatively, find someone to talk to about it. This will help you understand their reaction so that you can do your part to not make them angry in the future.


Sometimes you can’t help the way people react, and you have to be OK with them getting upset.
Find an objective third party, like an HR rep, a coworker in another department, or even someone at home. The goal is to find someone who will not gossip about it and spread rumors at work.

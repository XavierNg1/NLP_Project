 You can find a representative or agent to work with by visiting the eBenefits website (www.ebenefits.va.gov) and searching for a representative, attorney, or claims agent. You can search by state, city, or zip code.Working with a representative or agent is ideal if you are confused about the process. Also, agents and representatives can help you file a “fully developed claim,” which means that you gather all of the information for the VA and then submit the claim at one time.
If you file a “standard claim,” then the VA can get the records for you. This will increase the amount of time that you wait for a determination.
 You need to fill out an appointment form for any representative or agent to help you. You can download and complete the necessary forms from the VA website. Complete the form and then submit it to the representative or agent, who will send it on to the VA.If you are applying for assistance from a Veterans Service Organization (VSO), then download VA Form 21-22.
If you seek assistance from an accredited attorney or claims agent, then download VA Form 21-22a.
 Your representative or agent will help you develop your claim and get whatever remaining evidence you need but do not yet have. Your representative will then upload the application and supporting evidence onto the eBenefits system.

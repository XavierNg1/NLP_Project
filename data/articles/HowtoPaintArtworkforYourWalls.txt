 "Abstract" works pretty well since everyone can draw a few shapes and smack paint on canvas to create a nice work of abstract art. If you feel more artistic, think about one of the more common themes for art - a still life of flowers or fruit, a landscape with a cute little house and some fields, or a portrait of a pet or a person.;
, Some common canvas sizes are 8"x10", 16"x20", and 24"x36". There are also smaller or larger ones if you want to do a series of tiny paintings or a really huge one.
 If you can get the paper in the same size that your art will be in, that's great, but if not (ie, if you're using a huge canvas and just don't have that extra roll of art paper lying around), then just sketch it to scale and don't worry. Think about what colors you want before you go out to get your materials.
, If you decided on paint colors before you left the house, check to see that you get all the ones you wanted. Black and white are not always good to have for making colors lighter or darker To make shades, use the opposite of the color to darken it. For example, use green to darken red. Use a few paintbrushes or sponges to get it from the bottle to the canvas!

, Prop the canvas up on a chair, table, or easel while you work, and sit or stand as you feel comfortable.
 Have fun with it - again, don't try to be perfect.

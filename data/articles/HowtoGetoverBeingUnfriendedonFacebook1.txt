 Before you get worked up about someone unfriending you on Facebook, make sure that you are definitely no longer in each others' friend lists. Sometimes, it may seem like someone has unfriended you, when in reality they just don't post very much on Facebook.


You can tell if you are friends or not with someone if you click on their profile page and in the top right region of the page it either says "Friends" or "Add Friend."

If the box says "Friends", then you have not been unfriended, and you still appear in each others' friend lists.
If the box says "Add Friends", you are no longer friends on Facebook.

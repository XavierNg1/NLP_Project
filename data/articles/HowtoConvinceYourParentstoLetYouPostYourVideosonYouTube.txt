 Pick a time when they're together, are calm and have time to spare - perhaps when they're watching television or after dinner.;
, Chances are your parents won't let you post videos if they don't know what exactly the website is or what it's for.



You can develop your hobby.
Viewers can give constructive criticism which will help you improve.
It's a good platform from which to make your name a little better known or for potential local employers to find someone for a local gig/summer job/work experience.
If you're really good and decide it's a good idea, you can make money from your videos.
 If you're not comfortable with letting them see it, consider whether making it available to the whole world is really a good idea.
 Examples include singers like Justin Bieber and Conor Maynard or the now professional vlogger and BBC presenter, Daniel Howell (danisnotonfire) or Phil Lester (AmazingPhil).


Cut out any references in magazines or the newspaper, especially any celebrity advising you to use YouTube as a platform! Show these to your parents to back up your argument.
 What solution can you think of?


Are they worried about the video being decent or potentially damaging to a future career or relationship? Let them view it.
Are they worried about negative comments? Show you can turn them off if it's getting too much to handle.
Are they worried about bullying? Use the example of other websites you've used and show you can block users or report them.
Are they worried about safety? Bring some articles to show you've done your research.
Are they worried about not giving enough time to schoolwork? Agree on times you will use YouTube and times you will study.
 Arrange for them to phone each other or to call around for a cup of tea and a chat, perhaps when collecting or dropping the friend to your house.

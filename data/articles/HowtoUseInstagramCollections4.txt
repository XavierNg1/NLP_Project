This will make finding the post much easier., If you are trying to track the success of a marketing or advertising plan, or the popularity of your posts, you can use collections to help track the success of content. Save different posts so that you can go back later and look at what was popular and what was not. Use these insights to help adjust future posting plans., If there are posts that you want to read but don't have time to, you can use collections to organize these posts so that you can go over them in the future. You can also use it to save posts that you want to comment on later. To do this, create a collection called "Look at later" and save photos or posts that you want to view later. As you look through the posts you can delete them so that only the newest posts show up in the collection.

 If you buy frozen ones from the get-go, skip this step.
 They need to be able to fit in your blender and blend easily.
 Combine them with the fruit in your blender. If necessary, add more sugar or milk to get your preferred taste/consistency.
 The longer you blend, the more liquid it becomes. Try pausing for a little in between blending bursts, to mix up the smoothie and check its consistency.
 If the mixture gets too liquid for you, you can try putting it back in the freezer for a few minutes, or blending in more frozen fruits to thicken it up.

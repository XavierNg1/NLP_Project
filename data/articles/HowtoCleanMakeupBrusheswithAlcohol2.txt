 Fill a small spray bottle, which can be purchased at your local drug store, with rubbing alcohol., Lay your makeup brushes on a towel and spray the bristles with alcohol. You want to make sure that the bristles are completely saturated. In order to do this, you will need to flip the brushes over so that you can spray both sides of the brush., Once the brushes are saturated, wipe the bristles back and forth on a towel. You will notice makeup coming off of the brushes and onto the towel., Spray the brushes again with alcohol and then wipe them off on the towel. Continue to repeat the process until makeup no longer comes off of the brushes. This means that you have adequately removed all of the makeup and oils from your brushes., Once your makeup brushes are clean, squeeze out any remaining alcohol from the brushes using a towel. This will help to speed up the drying process., After squeezing the bristles, reshape them and then lay them on a countertop to dry. Do not use your makeup brushes until they are completely dry. Makeup could stick onto the brushes or it could cause your makeup to clump.

 You'll want to fold from the bottom (it makes the pillowcase less wrinkled), across the shorter side., You'll now have a long rectangular shape, which you'll need to smooth down.
 Smooth each time after you fold so that the pillowcase is not wrinkled. You should end with a small, rectangular stack.

 The way that you handle a crush on your best friend’s boyfriend really depends on the situation, so it is a good idea to think about what has been happening. Has he expressed feelings for you as well? Have you told anyone how you feel? Has anything happened? Think about what is going on before you decide what to do next., If your best friend’s boyfriend does not seem interested in you, then do not pursue him. Chances are that he will reject you and that he will then tell your best friend that you came on to him. This may not only anger her, but it could be the end of your friendship., If he has told you that he likes you as well, then you have the option of pursuing a relationship with him. However, keep in mind that by pursuing a relationship with him, you will likely lose your best friend. Consider whether he is worth that.Keep in mind that you will probably have many crushes over the years, but you may only have one best friend. Think long and hard before you make a decision.
 Another option is to wait and see if he and your friend break up. This is not ideal, but if you really like him and care about your friend as well, then you should let their relationship run its course.If the relationship ends, then you can consider dating him after your friend seems to be over him.


If you want to date him after your friend has broken up with him, then make sure that you talk to her about it as well. She may be fine with the two of you dating, but she may get upset if you try to date him without discussing it with her first.

 If you want a quick and simple way to change your look, you can simply change the way you part your hair.


If you normally part your hair to the side, change the side that you part it on, or try a middle part.
If you have a middle part, try moving it over to one side of your head.
To change your part, dampen your hair. Use a fine-tooth comb to find your new part, and then comb your hair over to create the part you want.
If you have a really prominent natural part or a stubborn cow lick, this might not work for you.
 If you’re rushed before school, adding different accessories can be a great way to make your hair look cute quickly.


Wearing headbands or head scarfs is a quick way to add some color to your hair and keep it out of your face at the same time.Try wearing headbands with your hair down or in a ponytail.
Adding bows to your hair is another way to add some pizzazz. Try tying a bow around a simple high ponytail.
 Even if you don’t have time to style your hair, you can use small clips to pull sections of your hair back away from your face.


They look pretty and are easy to put in and take out.
You can find clips that are black or brown for a neutral look or get colored or sparkly clips for a more stand-out look.

 Find one that is less than 1 foot (0.3Â m) tall, at a garden store or find one in the wild.;
, Is the tree damaged (many wounds, missing needles, exposed roots, and/or only a few branches)? Is it healthy (has lots of needles, lots of new growth, and intact bark)? It's always good to know how your tree is doing.
 Major pruning should be done in late winter. Be sure to cover wounds with sealant.


You should also prune the tree in mid to late spring. When growth is too prolific, prune back some of the new growth. New growth is easy to spot, as it is bright green.
 Once every two years, before major growth for the year starts, hemlocks should be repotted.
 Once most growth has ceased, small gauge wire (1/3 of the width of each branch to be wired) should be carefully wrapped around each branch that you want to move into a different position. Don't worry about knocking off a few needles in the process.
 Depending on the climate where you keep the bonsai, you may need to put it in a greenhouse to prevent hard freezing, but make sure that the tree stays cold enough that it reaches dormancy for the winter.
 Remove all of the wires from summer and rewire the tree.
 Keep a calendar with all the important dates to remember from this page.

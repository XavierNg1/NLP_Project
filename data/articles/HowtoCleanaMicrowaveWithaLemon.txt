 Citric acid is a natural, and powerful, cleaner. When mixed with water, you dilute it enough to make it easily applied and to your microwave.









Squeeze the juice into a microwaveable dish or container and mix with roughly 300ml (1 1/4 cups) of water.
In a pinch, white vinegar can be easily substituted, though it doesn't smell quite as appealing.;
, Place the container in the microwave and put the power on max for 5-10 minutes. This allows the steam to condense on the walls and roof of the oven.









If the dish starts running out of liquid, you can stop the microwave and move on. This may only take 2-3 minutes depending on the strength of your microwave.
If you have a microwave with automatic venting, it may take a long time to get noticeable condensation ,or the vapor may not condense at all. Some microwaves are designed to vent the air inside to prevent vapor buildup. If this trick hasn't worked after 10 minutes of microwaving water, it probably isn't going to work at all.
 Once the time is up, carefully remove the bowl. Grab a soft dishcloth and wipe that microwave out with unparalleled ease. Dip the cloth in some clean water and ring it out, then wipe everything down with one last clean sweep.
 Your kitchen will also smell fresh and clean.For best results, repeat this every few months, or whenever your microwave gets nasty. This works because the steam from the water moistens and loosens the cooked, dry food-splatter particles. The lemon imparts a delicious, fresh aroma.

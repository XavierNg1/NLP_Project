 Want to have animals in your animal center, but don't know where they are or how to attract them? Well, it depends what you want and where you live. If you live in a forest area, look for animals in a nearby bush or on a tree. If you live in a grassland area or field area, look for animals in holes and big grassy patches. If you live in a snowy area, dig up some snow and a small layer of dirt to find creatures.
 For a basic home animal center, some known attractions are:


Bunnies-carrots
Deer-fruit and roses
Squirrels-nuts
Garter snakes-worms and plenty of grass
Bugs- plants and compost
Birds-bird seed and trees

, If the answer is no, then put it in a box and add some water, food, and grass, then put a lid on it. If the answer is yes, then wipe it with a safe wipe and put something like a towel around the animal, and then leave it to relax. You may also want to wash the animal if it is bleeding.
 If you are looking after an animal and another comes along and you have no hired help, what should you do? Here are some answers:


If the current animal is healthy and the new animal is healthy, then put down the current animal in a box and get the new one. Do the same if the current animal is healthy and the new one isn't.
If the current animal is sick and the new one isn't, then you must decide if it is common. If the new animal is common in your area, leave it. If not, you must decide if the current animal is fine alone for a minute or not.
If both animals are sick, then you have to decide which is more important to you and which is more sick or unhealthy. If you experience this, try looking in your area for a friend nearby that is good with animals and ask them if they would like to help with your animal center.

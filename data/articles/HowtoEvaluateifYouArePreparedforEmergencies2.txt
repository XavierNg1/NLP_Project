 It is possible that you could lose your cell phone, the battery could die, you many not have Wifi access, or you may forget a significant telephone number or email address. So, it’s a great idea to make a contact card that has the telephone numbers, email addresses and addresses of family members, as well as local authorities such as police, hospitals and fire departments. Family members should carry their contact cards with them at all times., If your family includes children or seniors who don’t usually use mobile phones, you should make sure they know how to use one, including how to send and receive text messages. In the event of an emergency, it will be good to know that your grandmother, for instance, can read your text message., Put a chart with emergency phone numbers in the kitchen or living room. Program these numbers into your home phone and cell phone. Try to memorize these numbers, in case you lose your phone. It’s a good idea to include the hospital, police station and fire department numbers on this list.If you have an iPhone, use the Medical ID feature so you have easy access to these important phone numbers.
If you have another brand of smartphone, consider adding “In Case of Emergency” (ICE) contacts to your phone’s “favorites” list, or use a lock screen wallpaper image to display your important medical information., If you have parents, siblings or other close family members outside of your city, it is a good idea to give them a packet with copies of your key documents.

Give the copies to your family member who lives outside the city. In the event of a disaster, you will at least have a backup copy of this important information.

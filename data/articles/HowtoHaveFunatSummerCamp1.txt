 This will help you figure out what to pack and give you an idea of what to expect. Of course, your activities will vary from day to day, but knowing what the theme of your camp session is, if any, will help you get a general idea of what you will be doing every day.;
, If you're going to be doing a horseback riding camp, you don't want to find out five days in that you brought only one pair of pants and your guitar. If you're doing a music or band camp, you don't want to have five pairs of riding boots and a riding helmet with you. Make sure that the things you'll be doing and the things you bring match up.
 Talk to your parents or someone who has experience with the camp about any worries you may have. Chances are, they will have some helpful advice for you and maybe some stories to tell!

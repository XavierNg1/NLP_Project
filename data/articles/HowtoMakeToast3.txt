 The best way to evenly toast bread is in a convection oven or toaster oven. You can place the slices of bread on a baking sheet or pan, or you can place them directly on the rack.









Move the oven rack to the highest possible position in the oven to make toast. It's most efficient to use a high heat setting for a quick amount of time, preferably the broiler, which will use less energy by moving the toast closer to the heat source.
 The broiler, which heats the top of the oven only, is the quickest way to make toast. The only problem is that it can also burn quickly, so once you've set your desired temperature, you need to watch the bread closely so it doesn't burn.


If you have a gas stove, you'll likely have a separate broiler, which you can use to make toast. The only difference is that it'll be in a different location, probably below the main oven compartment, or on top of the range.
In most toaster ovens, you can set a timer that will turn off the oven at the appropriate time. It's still a good idea to watch it closely if you don't know your oven well.
 If you've got your bread on a rack, or you're using a broiler, the side facing up is going to toast, but the side facing down will still be soft. When you see the top start to brown, flip the bread over to toast the other side.
 Again, the broiler can quickly burn the toast, so remove it as soon as it looks nicely crisp and brown. It'll be black in another minute.

 Gophers and moles are attracted to certain environments. While you may not be able to change aspects of your garden, understanding what attracts rodents can help you get rid of them.


Gophers are attracted to most plants. They are herbivores, and eat any type of plant including garden weeds. They will quickly take advantage of old tunnels, so check your garden for gophers that have moved out.
Moles prefer moist and fertile soil where they can feed off insects, worms, and snails. Don’t attract moles by over watering. Moles especially like grub worms. Manage wet climates by removing grub worms in your soil. , Both moles and gophers tend to stay away from daffodils, marigolds, and castor bean plants. Be careful with castor bean around pets and children. It is considered a poisonous plant. , Both moles and gophers dislike castor oil. Create a rodent repellant using six ounces of castor oil, two tablespoons of dish oil, and a gallon of water. Spray the concentrate throughout the garden, especially after rain.


Gophers are particularly sensitive to smells and sounds. Try putting coffee grounds, fish, or pet waste in the gopher holes. These are all smells that drive gophers away. Additionally, consider using a noise-maker like wind chimes or radios to scare off gophers., Build a fence around the affected area. The fence should stretch two to three feet below the ground and about six to 12 inches above ground.


Use malleable wire fencing. The fence needs to extend beyond the vertical depth of the trench to create a curved “L” shape under ground. This will discourage rodents from digging deeper into your space! The fencing above ground will keep gophers from feasting on your plants.

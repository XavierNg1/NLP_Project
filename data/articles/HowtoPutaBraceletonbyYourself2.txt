 Use your fingers to gently pry it apart. You can either completely unbend it so only one “hook” remains, or bend it into an “S” shape. The “S” shape is often easier to hold because you can hook one end over your finger, so it stays in place.It’s important to choose a paper clip that’s large enough. When you unbend it, it should be long enough that you can create at least one hook that reaches your wrist while you’re holding it between your fingers or hooking it over your thumb.
If you don’t have a paper clip of the right size at home, you can use 16-gauge wire, such as picture hanging wire, that you can bend into a hook or “S” shape.
 You want to slip the clip through the ring loop at the end of the bracelet without the clasp. That will allow you to hold that end in place as you grasp the clasp with the other hand.Take care when you’re hooking the paper clip through your bracelet so you don’t scratch the jewelry.
 With the bracelet hooked on the clip, your reach is extended so it’s easier to wrap the jewelry around your wrist with your other hand and secure the clasp. Remember to unhook the paperclip from the bracelet’s ring loop before you head out to the door, though.Don’t toss out the paperclip when you’re done -- keep it in your jewelry box for the next time you need to put on a bracelet without assistance.

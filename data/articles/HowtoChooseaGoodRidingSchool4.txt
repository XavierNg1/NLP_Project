 An instructor can make or break a riding experience. Before you sign up for lessons, make sure that the instructor(s) is certified and can make your horseback riding experience a safe and enjoyable one. Here are some questions to ask:


Where did your instructor get their credentials?
How long have they been riding and teaching.
What style of riding do they teach? Is this the style you want to learn?
The most important question is one you should ask yourself: Can I see myself learning from this person?

 Firstly, draw one small half-circle for the ear. Next a bigger circle for the dog's head. Then an even bigger one for the body. Then a half-circle inside the dogs body to represent the dogs hind leg.;
, The paws are simply just ellipses and the tail is only a small triangle.
 The dog's face is just two lines, since his eyes are closed, and a small circle to complete the nose.
 Use an appropriate color for the fur. The nose will just be black.
 You can add a bubble over the dog's head, to show what he is dreaming. Just draw what he is dreaming inside the bubble. You can also add Z's to show his snore. Or make him a dog-bed! And don't forget to write your signature in the bottom right corner!

 In general, you should play down your other makeup if you're wearing yellow. However, bold lips and bold eye shadow pair well together. Try a bold color like orange, red, or pink.Opt for a glossy or shiny lipstick that really stands out.
 Besides your lips and eye shadow, keep your other other makeup minimal. Opt for a light layer of foundation with only a hint of things like bronzer or concealer. This will keep the focus on your bold eyes., Blush can really bring out the color in your cheeks. However, rosy cheeks and yellow eyeshadow may be a bit much. Instead of applying blush to your cheeks, dab on some highlighter. This will add sheen to your cheeks without adding too much color to your face. Apply your highlighter the same place you would normally apply blush., Avoid dramatic lashes with dramatic eye shadow. A single light layer of mascara should be enough when wearing yellow eye shadow. Opt for a neutral shade of mascara. Black or brown mascaras generally pair well with yellow eye shadow.Avoid fake eyelashes, as these will look too dramatic.

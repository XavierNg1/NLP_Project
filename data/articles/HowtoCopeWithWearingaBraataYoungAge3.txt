 Your best friend isnâ€™t called that for nothing. Your best friend wants to help you feel good about yourself. If something is bothering you, talk with your best friend about your concerns. They can come to your rescue if someone is teasing you.
 Even though you might feel self-conscious about wearing a bra when none of your friends wears one, they might be curious about what will happen to their bodies. You can be a source of information for your friends by telling them how to get a bra, what kinds of bras there are, and what it feels like to reach puberty., If there are any other girls who are also wearing bras at a young age, support them. Defend them if anyone is teasing them. Help them figure out how to talk with their mom or aunt. This can even start a new friendship for you.

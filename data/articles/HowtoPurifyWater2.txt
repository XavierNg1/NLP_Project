 Water purification tablets are made of either chlorine dioxide or iodine, and kill bacteria and viruses in water. To use these tablets, fill a pitcher or jar with water and add enough tablets to treat the water. One tablet typically treats 1 quart (1 L) of water. These tablets generally need anywhere from 30 minutes to four hours to work.Purification tablets do not treat water contaminated with protozoa or chemicals.
Iodine tablets are generally not suitable for pregnant women or people with shellfish allergies.
 Bleach can also be used to kill viruses and bacteria in water, but itâ€™s important to use only small amounts to avoid poisoning. Bleach must not be expired in order to work effectively. To purify water with this chemical:Fill a pitcher or jug with water
Add four drops (1/16 teaspoon) of bleach per quart (liter) of water
Shake or stir the mixture
Let the mixture sit for 30 minutes

, Plain liquid iodine can also be used to kill pathogens in water, but many people are turned off by the taste. To clean water with iodine, simply collect the water and add a 2 percent iodine solution. Stir in four drops of bleach per quart (liter) of water and let it sit for 30 minutes.

 It's always easier to write things down while planning a Girl Guide meeting, so that you don't forget important details. If you want, you could get together with another leader of your group (assuming that there is one) and share your ideas.;
, In your handbook, there's a list of program work and badges that the girls should cover during their 3 years as Girl Guides. Pick a part of the program work or the badge and do that in your meeting. Your meeting is going to center around this.
 Girl Guides have a special opening song that follows into a horseshoe formation. While the girls are in the horseshoe, explain to them what badge/program work you're going to do tonight.
 It's pretty easy to do once you've chosen what program work/badge you want to do. There are specific things that you need to do in order to earn the badge, and those things can be pretty time-consuming.
 At the beginning or at the end of your meeting, play some games such as "The Blanket Game", "Streets and Alleys", and/or "Statues".
 Plan a craft for the girls to do. If possible, have this craft relate to the badge you just earned. If you earned the reading badge, for example, make cool bookmarks!

, Girl Guides have a special closing song that they sing at the end of each meeting.

 If you're dancing or doing yoga or even running, there might be music in the background. Find the beats in your song and try to breathe along with them. If it's a fast song, breathe maybe every 2-4 beats. If you're running breathe along with your pace. Breathe in and out every 4-8 counts. Count to keep time, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.;
, Decide how you're going to breathe. Most people like to inhale through their nose, hold it for however long they need, then exhale through their mouths. Exhale slowly so you can keep up with your counts and don't breathe super loudly like Darth Vader. This will waste energy and get annoying.
 While you can change your breathing pace, it's better not to. If you are going to, make sure you have the counts in your head.
 No matter how tired you are, try to keep breathing. If you feel lightheaded or anything, though. STOP. Take a break. Remember that the breathing is there to help you not to hurt you.

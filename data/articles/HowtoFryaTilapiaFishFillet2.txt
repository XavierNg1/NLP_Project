 Just a couple of drops of water flipped off your hand will really crackle when the oil has reached this heat level.
 Shake off the excess flour and let the fillets sit on a rack or on wax paper for 5-10 minutes.


Roll the fillets in the flour a second time. As before, shake off the excess flour. Now they're ready for the pan!

, No more than 2 at a time, however. Frying more than 2 fillets at once drives down the oil temperature which will make the fish and coating soggy. Turn once in the pan after a minute or so and remove when golden brown.


They should be done in under 4 minutes; white and flaky inside at the thickest section of the fillet. Do not overcook!

, Garnish with sauces and sides for taste and presentation.

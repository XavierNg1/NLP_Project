 Naturally, people want to get their money's worth, and therefore practice is the key to generating revenue.;
, Get a Myspace, or even a domain name, and advertise what you do- you won't get any gigs if no-one's heard of you!

, In other words, join as many bands as possible, and push for gigs with them-the more mud you throw, the more will stick.
 Even though you're not getting any money, it's still marketing, and doing a good job that is exposed to an audience can never be a bad thing.
 You are the client, and they are the boss, and therefore don't try to demand food, drink etc; stick to whatever terms you have previously agreed upon.
 If they say, "can you turn down a bit?" or "can you play for a bit longer, please", do so.
 This is basic salesmanship, if a person likes you, they will prefer to have you than someone arrogant and unhelpful.
 Often, punters will find it hard to remember the names of bands they have seen, so give them a memory aid.
 You never know where they might lead. Always be gracious, and should a band disband, for example, keep in touch. If a previous band member goes on to do bigger and better things, you'll want to be a part of it.
 Often, you can never be overdressed, and a suit or tie will make you seem much more professional and intelligent than your peers. If it is a rock gig, however, you probably can stray from the "smart" look.
 Don't play overcomplicated songs that might alienate them, or songs that would not appeal to your target audience. Play whatever you want for fun, but when money is involved, what the audience wants is what the audience gets.

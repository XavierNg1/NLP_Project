 If you have an adult, especially an elderly adult, who seems to be startled easily when someone approaches them, they may have a hearing loss. For example, if you knock and enter a room, and they act startled when they finally see you, they may be having trouble hearing what's happening in their environment.


The adult may also not realize someone has entered their home or the room until after the fact.
The adult may not realize someone is speaking to them until they are physically touched or they have turned towards the person speaking.
This can difficult and frustrating, especially for elderly people. Take extra steps to ensure you don't startle them to prevent any traumatic reactions., Hearing loss in someone else can be difficult to recognize since you are not experiencing the symptoms. Look for signs like turning the TV volume up excessively, constantly asking you to repeat yourself, or a general lack of awareness of sounds around them.Any of the problems commonly mentioned above in recognizing hearing loss in yourself can also apply.
 If you know someone who has experienced hearing loss, you can try to help them cope and adapt to the change. This can include getting them devices that amplify the radio or television, hearing aids, or even louder alerts for basic necessities like alarm clocks and phones. You can also help by speaking clearly in front of them and avoiding loud environments that can drown out people around them and cause frustration.


You may want to take them to an audiologist or a doctor that can evaluate them and recommend treatments.

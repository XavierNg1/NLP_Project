Wait at least 15 minutes before washing it off., Take a half of the strawberry and rub the inside part of the strawberry on your face. Form small circles and cover your entire face. This will both exfoliate and cleanse your skin.Do not reuse a strawberry that you’ve already applied to your face. Use a fresh half or slice each time for best results.
Apply to any other exposed skin that you wish to exfoliate, such as your arms, neck, chest, or back.
 After going over your face with the strawberry, wait a few minutes so that your skin can absorb the nutrients and antioxidants. This will allow your skin to hydrate and moisturize in addition to the exfoliation that you just applied.


While waiting, eat the other half of your strawberry! You can receive all the benefits of vitamins and antioxidants in strawberries by eating them too.

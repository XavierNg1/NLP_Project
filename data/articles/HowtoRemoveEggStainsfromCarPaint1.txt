 If the stain is relatively fresh, it may be okay to use a mixture of soap and water to clean it. This method will likely be most useful within the first hour after the stain forms; after that, the egg white will dry and begin to etch into your topcoat of paint. Wet the stain with warm water to soften it before you begin manually cleaning., This is the solution you will be using to treat the stain. The gentler the soap, the better: ordinary car wash soap should be sufficient, or a regular-strength dish soap designed to cut grease. Hand soap won't do it. Harsher soaps contain astringent chemicals that can eat away at the paint and make the spot more noticeable. The warm water will help soften the stain and prepare it to be buffed out.


You can soak the soap and water mixture into a towel as you go, or prepare it in a spray bottle beforehand for ease of application.
Watch out for industrial cleaners. They can be extremely harsh on paint, and if you're not careful you could make the problem worse.
 Abrasive surfaces can damage your paint, especially if the job requires a lot of vigorous scrubbing. Find a microfiber towel or use the soft side of a kitchen sponge to go over the stain while leaving the paint unharmed.


While softer surfaces are less likely to damage your paint, it will take longer for them to work on the stain, increasing the total time of the process.
 Once the stain is gone, dry the area with a microfiber towel. Make sure all traces of egg are gone before drying--if not, the streaks that soften and run off will dry again, and you're back to square one. If possible, put the car up for the night somewhere enclosed to give it time to dry completely.


A chamois or microfiber towel works best for drying as it absorbs and holds moisture.

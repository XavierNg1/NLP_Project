 You may wonder where all of your time goes each day. Carry a notebook around and write down everything you do and for how long. You may be surprised about how you spend your time. Be honest when you do this.


Try keeping a diary for at least a few days to get a good picture of how you typically spend your day. For example, going to a birthday dinner or a doctorâ€™s appointment is not an everyday task for you and could throw your schedule off.;
, There are many ways that you can waste time. Do you spend a lot of time on social media? Do you hang out with your friends when you should be doing other things? Do you spend hours in front of the television?


It is important that you know yourself and your habits so you can make changes.
Look through your time inventory and see areas that you can cut back on.
 Instead of becoming upset that you are putting a task off, try to figure out the reasons for your procrastination. Think of procrastinating as a symptom of a larger problem and try to get to the root cause. Are you scared to do the task? Are you tired? Is the task boring? Is the task too easy or too hard?If the task is too easy, offer yourself little rewards for completing each step.
If the task is too hard, deadlines and small steps are the best way to tackle it.
Take into consideration the amount of time you spend procrastinating as well when you do your time diary.

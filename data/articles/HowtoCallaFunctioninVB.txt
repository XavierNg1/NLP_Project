Use a Function procedure when you need to return a value to the calling code.
A function itself has a type, and the function will return a value to the calling subroutine based on the code that it contains.;
,


You can define a Function procedure only at module level. This means the declaration context for a function must be a class, structure, module, or interface, and cannot be a source file, namespace, procedure, or block.
A function is declared the exact same way as a subroutine, except using the "Function" keyword instead of "Sub".
Function procedures default to public access. You can adjust their access levels with the access modifiers.



You call a Function procedure by using the procedure name, followed by the argument list in parentheses, in an expression.
You can omit the parentheses only if you are not supplying any arguments. However, your code is more readable if you always include the parentheses.
A function can also be called using the Call statement, in which case the return value is ignored.
To return a value, assign a value of the proper type to the function's name, as if it were a variable.

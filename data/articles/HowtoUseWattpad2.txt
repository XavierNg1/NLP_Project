 Go into discover, which is the eye-looking icon. Then go into search (the magnifying glass icon). Write in the name of a story, or any keywords, example 'romance', 'action', 'fanfiction', etc. Discovering stories on Wattpad relies on tags and keywords., Once you find a title or book cover that looks interesting to you, read a blurb. Never judge a book by the cover. Find out for yourself. Read the blurb to see if it's completed or ongoing, and how many chapters/parts there are.
 If you've decided you want to read it, then click on the orange button that says 'READ', or click on the other orange button next to it with a plus sign on it ( + ). Once you've clicked read, it'll give you options to either add the title to your library or a reading list. Click on one, and the story will be added.
 If you've added it to library, then you go to your library, which is the one with the icon of a stack of three books. You'll see the story cover when you go into it. Click on the cover, and it'll take you straight to the first part.


The benefit of adding titles to your library is that you can access the work without WIFI.

 Find out key information, like what you will be doing when you return to school. Ask for summer reading lists or practice math problems. Speak to your teachers and school librarian about good websites for learning about science, history, and other subjects over the summer., Ask your teacher or school counselor for the next year’s syllabi. Also ask for lists of textbooks or other materials that will be used. You don’t need to start reading the textbooks over the summer, but you can look through them to see topics that you might like to learn about in advance.
 Don’t look at your notes right away. Give yourself a few weeks to clear your head and rest from the stress of the school year. When you’re ready, take a day or two to sort your notes and put them in order. Skim them while you organize as a way to review from last year. Type up anything that you think will be helpful for future courses and as a way to review them more intensively., Focus on other ways to keep learning over the summer, like reading a lot of books. The best thing you can do in the summer is to dedicate some time to academic-type activities. For example, you can work on your creative writing.If you do want to review, borrow notes from your friends.
You can also go online if your teacher posted material on your school or class websites.
 Make a list of the things that gave you trouble in the past year, like quadratic equations or history. Plan how you’ll review those things, like using math websites for homeschooled students or reading books about history. Add information that you learned from consulting your teachers or the syllabi to your list.


If you were in a class that didn’t finish the curriculum and you need that information for next year, like subjunctive verb tenses in a language class, add those to your review list.

 The "Options" dialog box is a multi-tabbed box that governs how Publisher does certain things, including the measurement unit displayed on the rulers. To access this dialog in Publisher 2003 or 2007, select "Options" from the "Tools" menu.
 Normally, the "Options" dialog box will open with the "General" tab, the leftmost tab, already selected.
 You can choose from 5 units.


Choose "Inches" to display the rulers in inches. This is the default option.
Choose "Centimeters" to display the rulers in centimeters. One inch equals 2.54 cm.
Choose "Picas" to display the rulers in Picas. Picas are a measurement unit used in printing; 1 inch equals 6 picas.
Choose "Pixels" to display the rulers in pixels. Pixels are a screen measurement; in Publisher, 1 inch equals 96 pixels.
The fifth option, "Points," changes the unit of measure to points, but displays the rulers in inches. Points are another measurement unit used in printing, commonly used to measure font sizes. One inch equals 72 points. You may want to use this option if you plan to have a number of objects on any of the pages in your publication to give you better precision in placing the guides to lay them out or to improve the layout of large blocks of body text.

 If your brunch recipes include packed foods or pre-made sauces, it is very important that you carefully read the label. Some items will be specifically marked as gluten-free, but you should still read the entire list of ingredients to be safe. Pay particular attention to the fine print. Some labels will now mention if a product was processed in a wheat-free environment.For a complete list of foods to avoid, read the Unsafe Gluten-Free Food List at www.celiac.com.
 When you are preparing brunch, be very careful to ensure that gluten contamination does not occur. For example, make sure that all pots and pans are thoroughly washed between each use. If you are cooking regular pancakes as well as a gluten-free option, it is extremely important that you do not use the same cooking utensils or serve them on the same platter., Wood can trap gluten, making it difficult to clean. As a result, when you are cooking for someone with a gluten intolerance, you should use plastic cutting boards, spatulas, and utensils. These are less likely to have any residual gluten on them from the last time they were used.

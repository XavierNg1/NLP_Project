 Looking to get a little more variety in your crisp, or fine-tune it to your particular taste buds? This recipe is more of a template than anything, and adjusting it is easy. You can:


Omit the oats from the topping, instead adding an extra 1/2 cup of flour.Adding more cold butter for a richer topping, or 2 tablespoons (29.6Â ml) melted butter with the apples for a richer base.Change the brown sugar to white sugar mixture, adding more brown sugar for a more molasses-like taste.
 You can add them to either the topping, the apples, or both -- there are recipes that support all three. In general, the most commonly used nuts are pecans or walnuts, though toasted or sliced almonds, especially in the crumb topping, can be divine as well., You can add different fruits easily without changing your workflow much, simply tossing it in with the apples before the lemon, flour, and sugar. Some great compliments for the apples include:Dried fruits, like raisins, currants, and cranberries.
Fresh cranberries
Pears
Plums, This autumnal crisp goes great with tea, or a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. Note, however that these spices go a long way, and you shouldn't need much more than a 1/2 teaspoon of each, though you could double the cinnamon if desired.


Spices go well if you add dried fruits, as well.
A touch of maple syrup here will help balance the spices with a dash of sweetness.
 Simply use a rubber spatula to mix the flour, sugar, and oats in with the honey until it forms small, sticky balls. This mixture will be decidedly less rich, but it will be much, much lower in calories., You want to use two apples that cover each other's "weaknesses." Otherwise said, you want to find a mostly sweet apple to combine with a more tart apple, like a sweet Fuji with a pucker-inducing Granny Smith. In general, this green-red combination will do you well.

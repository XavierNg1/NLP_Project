Be aware that significantly resizing a graphic will change its resolution. Making a graphic twice as large will reduce its resolution by half, while making it half its size will double its resolution. Graphics for printed publications should have a resolution of 200 to 300 dpi, while graphics for the Internet should have a resolution of 72 to 96 dpi. For this reason, it is helpful to choose graphic images as close to the size you need in the beginning so that you have to resize them only slightly, if at all.

 Like stemware, the ideal wine decanter should be made of smooth, thin, and clear glass. This allows you to observe the wine clearly in the vessel, which is a facet of learning to appreciate a wine's quality. Avoid using colored or overly decorative decanters that obscure the wine's appearance.;
, Your wine decanter should always be stored in an enclosed cupboard to keep it from accumulating dust. Before use, giving the decanter a quick rinse will help remove any musty odors acquired in storage. Rising with mineral water instead of tap water will help avoid any chlorine odor or taste.
 After each use, you will of course want to clean the decanter. Instead of using detergent, which can leave a residue along the inside of the decanter, clean the wine decanter by swirling a mixture of ice and coarse salt inside the vessel. Allow the decanter to air dry before the next use.

 Unlike the reports for Dun & Bradstreet and Equifax, an Experian business credit report assigns one general risk level—and that’s it. Experian doesn’t index payment histories or attempt to score a business’ viability, and it doesn’t provide a suggested lending amount.The possible scores range from 100-1, with 100 being the best and 1 being the worst.
Even though Experian doesn’t provide scores for payment history or financial stress, it does provide information describing payment history and financial health. This includes payment history, delinquent accounts, bankruptcies, judgements, and liens., There are several factors that go into the creation of the score. Most of these factors show up in the more narrow metrics that the other credit rating companies provide in their reports. The factors include:Age and size of the company.
Number of financial and commercial accounts which are late.
Available credit vs. the percentage of credit which is utilized.
New lines of credit and new credit applications.
 Experian weights age and size of the company more heavily than do the other ratings agencies. Therefore, smaller companies are assigned higher risk factors, even with histories of good payment, than are larger companies.

 If you cooked the corn with the husk on, you will need to remove it. There are two ways to do it, depending on how you cooked it. This is important, especially if you seasoned the corn beforehand. Removing the husks incorrectly could result in you removing the seasoning!


If you boiled, steamed, or microwaved the corn: cut the bottom inch (2.54 centimeters) off, grip the corn by the exposed end and the point, then pull.If you baked or grilled the corn: untie the strings holding it together (or peel away the aluminum foil), then peel the husks away.;
, You can eat your corn plain, or you can add some butter or salt on top. For a fancier meal, try butter seasoned with herbs and/or spices. If you already seasoned your corn beforehand, you could add any leftover seasoning on top.


Don't butter your corn all at once. Instead, butter it only one or two rows at a time. This will prevent messy drips., This is a great idea if you aren't feeling very hungry. Some people also find it easier to chomp into smaller pieces of corn rather than larger ones.
 It will also keep them from getting burnt if the corn is still hot. If you can't find any, you can wrap folded paper towels around each end of the corn instead.
 Hold the corn by each end, then bite off the kernels.Start at one end and work your way to the other, like a typewriter.


You can also the corn working your way in vertical rows rather than horizontal.
 Stand the cob up on one end, then use a sharp knife to slice off the kernels. You can then eat the kernels with a fork or spoon.

 If you are trying to get food smells out of the plastic container, make sure that you have removed all food scraps. If you are having trouble getting food remains off the inside, try to use an object like a spatula and scrape the food off, or run warm water onto the container and scrub off dried food.


Wipe away grease or oil. Even if you have gotten rid of food scraps, you still may have a greasy residue on your container. Wipe the container thoroughly with a paper towel to absorb oil or grease.;
, Soaking your container can ease out stubborn bad odors. Fill the sink or a large bowl with warm water, then pour in a generous amount of dish detergent. Let the container soak for at least thirty minutes.If just soaking the container didnâ€™t remove the smell, scrub the container with a scrub brush while it is still submerged in the water. This should work the soap into the container, so that it can pick up the offending odor.
 Take the container out of the soapy water. Give it a quick rinse to wash away soapy residue. Dry the container with a cloth or paper towel. Then sniff it to see if the odor has gone.
 Make sure that your plastic container is dishwasher safe, then stick it in the dishwasher and put it through a cycle. The high heat of the dishwasher may work to remove the odor if you have not been able to get it out through hand washing.Put the container on the top rack to prevent warping.

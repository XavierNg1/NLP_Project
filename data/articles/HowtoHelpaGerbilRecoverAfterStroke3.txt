 The most common sign of stroke is paralysis in your gerbil. This generally occurs along one side. The gerbil may not be able to use their paws, or their eyes or parts of their face may droop.The gerbil may have trouble feeding themselves or moving like they used to.
 Most strokes occur in gerbils when they are elderly, usually two years or older. Sometimes, younger gerbils who have other related conditions or health problems can have strokes, but this is uncommon., Elderly gerbils can recover from strokes with some minor nursing care. While they may have some paralysis, many times the gerbil will make a full recovery. Making sure the gerbil gets enough rest, along with food and water, can help ensure a full recovery.Gerbils who have experienced a stroke may be at a higher risk for strokes in the future. Sometimes, gerbils will have multiple strokes that eventually leads to death. However, with proper care and love for your gerbil, you can increase the chances of recovery after multiple strokes. A gerbil with a minor disability or paralysis from multiple strokes can still live a happy life.

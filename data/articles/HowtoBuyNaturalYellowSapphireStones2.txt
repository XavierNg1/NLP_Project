 Below one carat an original yellow sapphire can be cut into almost any shape, but beyond one carat jewelers prefer to cut it into either oval or cushion mixed cut. On the other hand jewelers often cut synthetic stone into oval and emerald shape.
 Fortunately, manufacturers of synthetic stone usually place an X cut, also called a scissors cut, on the facets of a stone.
 A synthetic stone, no matter how original it may look, will definitely possess some flaws which can be easily identified under 10x to 30x magnification. A magnifying glass will help you identify the curved and groove banding found in synthetic sapphires, especially when you place a translucent glass in between the stone and the light.

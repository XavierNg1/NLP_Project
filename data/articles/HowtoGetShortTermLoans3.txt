 Depending on where you live, there is likely a short-term loan office in your area. Look for businesses with things like “Payday Loan” or “Currency Exchange” in their names. Search the internet or a local phone book to locate the office in your area, and visit them during business hours.
 Once you meet with a short-term loan representative, you will be asked to verify your identity. Depending on the establishment, you may be asked to provide either one or two forms of I.D. A state I.D., driver’s license, birth certificate, or passport are great options., Rather than checking your credit rating, most short-term loans are awarded based on your ability to repay. This means that you must verify your employment status and income. You may use either current paystubs or bank statements to verify your employment and income., This particular practice will vary from establishment to establishment, but in general, you will also be asked to write a post-dated check to the short-term loan office. This check acts as a form a insurance that you will repay your loan., Once you have verified your identity, verified your employment, and written the post-dated check, you will be ready to receive your loan. Many lenders offer to wire the money directly into your bank account. Other establishments will write you a money order, that you will need to cash., As mentioned above, short-term loans tend to have strict repayment plans. Typically, the borrower is expected to repay the loan in person on their next payday. If the borrower does not repay the loan on time, the lender may roll over the loan, adding more fees, or redeem the post-dated check.

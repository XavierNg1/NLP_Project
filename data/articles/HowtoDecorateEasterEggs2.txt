 Real eggs are difficult to use with this method because they break easily. A plastic or paper mache egg is best to use. You can use any color egg you’d like., You don’t have to paint the egg if it’s already the same color as the glitter you will be using. If it isn’t, choose a color of acrylic paint that is the same color as your glitter. Use a paint or sponge brush to coat the egg in two or three layers of paint. Wait until the egg completely dries to move on., Use a separate sponge brush to apply a thick coat of mod podge to the egg. Make sure all of the egg gets covered with the Mod Podge. This part will be messy, and your fingers will likely get covered with glue.You can use baby wipes to get the glue off of your fingers.
 Put the egg into a plastic cup. The narrowest part of the egg should be facing upward. Pour glitter over the egg. Gently shake the cup so that the glitter covers the egg. You can add more glitter if necessary., Once the egg is coated in glitter, give it thirty to sixty minutes to dry. You can leave the egg in the cup as it dries, or place it in an egg carton.

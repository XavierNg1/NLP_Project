 Rub peppermint oil or vapor onto your chest to help loosen the phlegm in your lungs.

 Rehydrate yourself to liquefy sputum or secretions.Water can also help to reduce the stickiness of the secretions in your lungs, making them easier to cough up.


Try to take sips of water frequently throughout the day. The amount of water each person needs to stay hydrated differs from person to person. However, an average adult male generally needs 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water, while the average adult female generally needs 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water.
Drink very cold water if you are experiencing an unproductive cough (where no phlegm is coughed up). The cold water can help to calm your cough. When you have an unproductive cough, the cough can irritate your throat, rather than helping to clear your lungs.

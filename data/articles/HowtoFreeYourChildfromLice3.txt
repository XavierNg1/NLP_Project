 When your child comes home with lice, it is critical not to allow the lice to spread to your other children or the adult members of your family. Remember, you are equally exposed when treating your child, so cover your head and check yourself rigorously for exposure after treating your child. Scientific findings suggest that animals are not at risk for contracting head lice from humans, so don’t worry about your dogs, cats, or other animals. , Lice can live on bed linens, towels, stuffed animals and in thick carpeting. They can also survive on hair care devices, like combs or brushes, for a short period of time. Identify all surfaces which could have potentially come into contact with the infected individual. , Any items like sheets, towels and stuffed animals can be cleaned in a washer and dryer. However, be sure that wash these items with the “hot water” setting on your washer. It typically requires a temperature of 130 °F (54.4 °C) to eliminate lice and their nits. Also, be sure to dry these items on the hottest setting your dryer provides. , Be sure to vacuum all of your rugs, carpets, cloth blinds, tablecloths, or any other soft fabric items with the highest setting your vacuum will allow. Once you have done this, immediately throw away the vacuum cleaner bag to prevent lice from escaping. , Place hair-care items like combs, barrettes, hair ties, headbands, and brushes in rubbing alcohol or medicated shampoo for at least one hour. , Lice infestations are often difficult to eliminate entirely, so be sure to monitor your house and the people in it to ensure the lice have not survived on a surface you forgot to clean or in the hair of another person in your household. Being vigilant can help you avoid re-infestation.

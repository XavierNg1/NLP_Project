 Draw a face on the inside of the wooden spoon using felt tip pens. Draw whatever expression suits the puppet you're making - happy, sad, angry, poking a tongue out etc. You might like to make either a person or an animal. Consider other possible ideas, including an alien, a fairytale character or a mythical beast.;
, Use masking tape to stick pieces of tissue paper and scrap material to your wooden spoon for clothing (or scales, armour etc.). This is a lot less messy than glue and you can change the features any time you feel like it. Stick the craft items to the handle to create a costume for your puppet.
 Add pipe cleaners for arms and legs by twisting them around the handle.
 Add feathers to the head of your wooden spoon puppet. You might also like to try some of the other items suggested in "Tips".
 Then you can put on a puppet show!

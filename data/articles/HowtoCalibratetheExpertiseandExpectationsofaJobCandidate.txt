 More often than not, candidates are called for an interview and their caliber is judged in an hour only. Is it the right way? Or should a business re-look and review the entire approach?;
, Too many businesses, despite knowing their strength and market size, are proud to recruit candidates from much bigger organizations, thinking that such employees will add great value. However, this is an attempt to engage an elephant to pull a cart. Elephants can indeed do more work than a bull but the nature of the job and the job brief won't fit the elephant. After some time, the business will realize that the employee recruited is not contributing and hence should be shown the door.
 For skills-based work, a thinker or a creator would be a wrong choice. Every job brief should have a clear growth map as to what extent the function can possibly grow and contribute to the organization in future. If the growth potential is limited, however talented the employee may be, the opportunity is going to be very limited for the selected candidate.
 Before hiring an employee, the HR and the organization must question the fact whether the candidate is hired for his/her leadership and vision or for his/her administrative capabilities and contribution to the ongoing work.
 When the ‘present’ is in great need, the future is always a mirage. When an employee is hired based on his future contributions, demanding performance from such candidate in the current activities will certainly create a mismatch. This should be understood by both the organizations as well as the candidates looking for a career.
 The assessment of the candidates during interview should be done through the ‘compound eyes’ by using ‘mosaic vision’. This is applicable to the candidate as well in selecting the organization to work with. They should not jump to a job without knowing the brief, as it may jeopardize their career or may delay or deny the growth prospects.

 Distribute each plant one per "pizza slice". Follow the standard planting instructions for each herb or vegetable:


Basil

Peppers/capsicum

Tomatoes, oval-shaped or "egg" tomatoes (also known as Roma tomatoes)
Oregano
Onions

Parsley.
 Keep it well watered and appropriately fertilised. The beauty of the quarters is that you can attend to each plant's needs separately.


This is a garden that you can keep growing for quite a while so that you can continue enjoying fresh pizza toppings. Encourage children to collect the fresh pizza toppings every time you make a pizza.
 Not all plants will be ready at the same time, so use what is available at any particular time. As the growing season goes on, there will be a time when everything is ready at once.

 Begin with the last name of the artist, followed by a comma and the first name. For example:


“Lukas, Joe.”;
, Use a period, and then add the name of the painting in italics. Next, add the date. If the date is not known, use the abbreviation “n.d.” instead. After the date, write the medium. The medium could include anything from oil or watercolor on canvas to mixed media on wood. Usually, it includes what was used to make the art and what the art was made on.


“Lukas, Joe. Lovely Flowers. 2011. Acrylic on canvas.” Only use the year.
 After writing the medium down, write the museum where the painting is displayed. You should also include where the museum is located. Use a comma, followed by the city and state with a comma in between. End with a period to complete your reference-page citation:


“Lukas, Joe. Lovely Flowers. 2011. Acrylic on canvas. The Museum of Flowers and Fauna, Topeka, Kansas.”

, Alphabetize your sources by the artist’s last name. If the painting is not in a museum, list its location if it has a formal name. You can also list something like “private collection.”

, For an in-text citation, just use the artist’s name. At the end of the sentence where you are citing the painting, place the author’s name in parenthesis before the period:


“Reds are especially bright in floral paintings like Lovely Flowers (Lukas).”

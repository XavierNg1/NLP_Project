 Often, you can get away with some loose fitting clothing for several months before having to switch over to maternity wear.
 Pants with an adjustable waist will come in handy for awhile before they are no longer suitable for your belly. Pair those skinny leggings with a long shirt.
 These types of clothing offer enough room to accommodate your growing belly for several months. You can even wear your more stretchy dresses as tops as your belly expands.
 Purchase a belly band to hold up your jeans so that you can leave them unzipped. By wearing a long shirt to cover the band, no one will even notice that you are wearing a belly band.
 Roll up the sleeves and wear them over a pair of leggings.
 Perhaps a too-short dress can become a long shirt or a pair of stretchy pants can be turned into shorts.
 You can hunt for clothing that you may use from the items that they no longer want.

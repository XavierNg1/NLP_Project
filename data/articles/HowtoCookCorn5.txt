 Remove the husks and silks from each ear of corn as the oven preheats.


To remove the husk from an ear of corn, snap off the stem using your hands. Pull the broken stem down over the ear, stripping away any husk attached to it. Peel the rest of the exposed husk away with your fingers.
Rinse each corn cob under running water, scrubbing gently with your hands to remove any visible silks. Pat dry with paper towels.
 You can also add a little salt and pepper, if desired.


Use plenty of butter. Spread at least 1 to 2 Tbsp of melted butter over each ear.
 Each ear must be completely wrapped inside its own sheet of aluminum foil.


If you are worried about butter leaking out from the aluminum foil, place a flat baking sheet or jelly-roll pan beneath the wrapped ears of corn to catch any dripping butter.
 Most ears of corn will only take 20 minutes to cook, but larger ears may need as many as 30 minutes.


Place the corn on the middle rack of your oven to ensure the most even cooking.
 Let the cooked ears of corn rest for 2 to 5 minutes before carefully removing the aluminum foil. Serve once they are cool enough to touch.

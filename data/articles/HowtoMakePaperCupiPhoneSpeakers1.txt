 If you can't find an empty toilet paper roll, you can use an empty paper towel roll instead. Consider cutting the paper towel roll in half to make your speakers more compact and sturdy.;
, Set the roll down horizontally in front of you. Place the base of your iPhone on top of the roll, right in the center. Make sure that your phone is facing you. Use a pen or pencil to trace around the base of your phone. When you are done, set your phone aside.


This method will also work on other phones and music players, such as iPods.
 Using the knife, cut out the front and sides of the rectangle. Leave the back edge uncut.
, If you make the circles too high up, the speakers won't amplify very well.
 Try to cut just inside the lines you drew. This will allow the paper roll to fit snugly inside the holes.
 Don't push the cups all the way onto the per roll. 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) on each side should be plenty. If the cups wobble too much on the paper tube, draw a line of hot glue around the joint/seam. This will close the gap a little, and make your speakers more stable.
 Paint the speakers a solid color using spray paint or acrylic paint. Wait until the paint dries, then add more designs, if desired.You can also wrap the paper tube with colored or patterned duct tape instead., If you are using another type of phone, ensure that the speaker part is inside the slot. Hit the play and speaker buttons, and enjoy the music.

 You can also check the Google search history on your mobile device. The same basic principles apply, but the techniques are a little different. As with all the browser-based methods, you will only be able to view your history on Google on that browser accessed on that device, unless you are going through your Google account.


Though mobile devices use browsers with names like those of common PC and Mac browsers, the mobile versions differ pretty substantially.
 The first step is to open the browserâ€™s history, just like you would on a laptop or PC. This is, however, somewhat more complicated with mobile devices. The method you need to use differs slightly from device to device, as different operating systems are set out in different formats.


On iOS (Apple) devices, touch the bookmarks symbol near the top of the window to display the browser history.On Android devices with Chrome, tap the Menu button on the top of the browser window. Then tap "History."On Android devices using Firefox, tap on the URL bar. Then tap on the "History" tab that appears., On mobile devices, you cannot use search terms to quickly scan a portion of you history, like you can on a laptop or a Mac. It is much more time consuming, but you simply must scroll through the whole of your history and visually search for entries you are looking for.

 Whether you have a small or large club, it is very helpful to get to know everybody in there. The job of an editor is to be in charge of communications. If you get to know everybody, then your job will be a lot easier and you will be more likely to get responses when you need it.;
, There are so many different ways to communicate these days and people prefer using different types of communication. You need to develop all of the different forms in order to have optimal communication. The main ones include Facebook, Email, and your Website. If you don't already have a group page on Facebook, a weekly email going out, and a website to post everything going on, then get started!

, As events come up, you need to know everything about it so that members can come to you with any questions they have. If you don't have the information, then it will take a lot longer to answer their questions

, As a KEY club officer, you are part of a team. This isn't a one many show, so you need to be able to work well with a team. You all need to be meeting once a week to plan the upcoming meeting and volunteer events. This needs to be separate from the regular member meetings.
 Now that you have your methods of communications up, you need to be using them. As soon as information becomes available, you need to update everyone else on it quickly and clearly.
 Even though this position is just over communications, you may be needed with more than just that. This is especially true with younger, growing clubs. Be willing to step up and help out anytime the rest of the club needs you.

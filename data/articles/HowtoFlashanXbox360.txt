 Before you start disassembling and flashing, you'll want to ensure that your Xbox 360 has been updated recently. This is because the flashing software has been designed to work with the most recent updates, and you may run into some errors if you don't have your Xbox 360 current.

See this guide for more details on updating your Xbox 360.;
, In order to flash the DVD drive, you will need to pull it out of the Xbox 360. To do this, you will need to remove the outer panel of the Xbox.

See this guide for detailed instructions on opening your Xbox 360 case.
 Gently pull the DVD drive straight out of the Xbox. Make sure that you do not tug the cables that connect the drive to the Xboxâ€™s circuitry., After pulling the drive out, disconnect the two cables that attach the drive to the Xbox. You should now be able to remove the drive completely from the console., There are four different possible DVD drive manufacturers that your Xbox 360 could be using. Some drives will require more tools than others. You can identify the drive by examining the sticker on it. You only need to know the manufacturer in order to determine what tools and process you will be using.

The four manufacturers are Lite-On, Samsung, BenQ, and Hitachi.
 In order to flash your drive, you will need to download the software designed for the process. There is a program called JungleFlasher which is designed specifically to flash Xbox 360 drives. You can download JungleFlasher for free from the developer's website.

You will also need the firmware files for your drive. Download the iXtreme LT+ 3.0 firmware files from the iXtreme website. JungleFlasher does not come packaged with these files for legal reasons. These firmware files change the way the Xbox 360 DVD drive functions, allowing you to install custom software.
If you are flashing a Hitachi drive, you will need to download the extra iXtreme LT+ 3.0 Hitachi files as well.
 After downloading JungleFlasher, extract the folder to an easy to access location on your computer. You do not need to install JungleFlasher in order to use it. Placing the JungleFlasher folder on your desktop or on the root of your hard drive will make it easy to access during the flashing process., Once you've extracted JungleFlasher, extract the archive containing the iXtreme LT+ 3.0 firmware files. Open the extracted folder, and then open the Firmware folder. Copy all of the files into the Firmware folder in the JungleFlasher directory., Open the JungleFlasher directory, and then open the libusb folder. Copy the libusb0.dll file from this folder and place it into the JungleFlasher root directory, the same location that the JungleFlasher.exe program is located.

Open the PortIO folder and copy both of the files to the JungleFlasher root directory as well.
 You will need several tools in order to connect your DVD drive to your computer so that it can be flashed:

USB Connector tool (Xecuter X360USB, X360USBPro)
DVD Power-to-Molex adapter (Xecuter CK3 Lite). This isn't required if you are using the Xecuter X360USB tool, as it is already built in. If you are using the X360USBPro tool, you will need this adapter.
Probe (TX CK3 PROBE 3, TX SPUTNIK360 UNLOCK PROBE, MAXIMUS 360 SCORPION TOOL V2). This is only required for the Lite-On drive. No other DVD drive requires this tool.
Molex-to-outlet power connector (Molex to USB works as well)

, If you are flashing a Lite-On DVD drive, you will need to remove the protective panel on the DVD drive in order to access the circuitry. Flip the drive over and remove the four screws holding the panel in place. Remove the panel to expose the circuitry.

You only need to do this for Lite-On drives. If you are using any other drive, you can skip this step.
 If you are using the Xecuter X360USB tool, connect the Molex cable to the Molex adapter on the USB tool, and then connect the other end to the Molex-to-outlet adapter. Connect the USB tool to the DVD drive using the standard power cable (unless you are flashing a Lite-On, in which case refer to the next step). If you are using the X360USBPro, connect the CK3 Lite to the DVD drive using the power cable, and then connect the CK3 Lite to the outlet using the Molex-to-outlet adapter., Connect the probe cable to both the USB connector and the drive. Plug the end of the cable with the push button to the power connector on the DVD drive. Plug the other end of the cable into the USB connector.

Attach the probe piece to the small wire coming out of the probe cable. The probe should light up.
 This will allow data to be passed from your computer to the DVD drive., Plug the connector into an open USB port on your computer. Avoid using a USB hub, as it will not provide enough power. You can use an extension cable if you can't reach a port. More lights should appear on the USB connector when plugged into the computer., Once the drive is connected to the USB tool and your computer, you can start JungleFlasher to begin the flashing process., Click the DVDKey 32 tab.

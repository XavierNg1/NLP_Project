Do some research online to see what colleges and universities offer online courses. There are a lot of schools to choose from, so do your homework. Before you decide to choose a college, make sure it is accredited. Some online colleges offer the courses you are looking for, but they aren't recognized by professional nursing associations. So before you make that choice, see if the school you are looking at is accredited.;

Once you have decided what college you want to attend, see what courses they have to offer. You want to make sure the courses you take are inline with what most nursing programs offer their students--just in case you want to go for your RN degree later. Some of the main classes you will need would be Anatomy, Physiology, and Biology; these are just a few of the courses you will need to become an LPN. You'd rather be safe than sorry in terms of what courses you take, especially if you are thinking about transferring your transcript from one college to another.



Filling out your application should be an obvious thing to do, but when you begin filling it out, be sure to have all your information in front of you, like transcripts, financial aid information, etc. You don't want to start filling out your information then miss a step and have to do it all over again.



If you are going to take online classes, have your own personal computer. You don't want to spend several nights during the week at a library or a friend's or relative's house trying to take your classes. You should also make sure that it's an updated computer in good working condition. So ensure that your computer gets a good checkup from someone with knowledge about computers. You don't want to have any technical issues while you are trying to start your class work.

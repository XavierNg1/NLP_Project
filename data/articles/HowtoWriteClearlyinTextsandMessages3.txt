 Short sentences are easier to follow. Long sentences, even if grammatical, can lead to confusion. Further simplify your sentence structure by using a Person – Action – Subject structure. If you’re giving instructions, you can often leave out the person and use an Action – Subject structure. For example


”Tom won the game.” (P – A – S)
”Alex is watching TV.” (P – A – S)
”Refresh the webpage.” (A – S), Active voice puts the doer of an action close to the action being done. Passive voice, the opposite of active voice, separates doer from that which is done. This can make writing difficult to follow. Always use active voice where possible to improve the clarity of your writing.Passive: The game was played at the party by my friends.
Active: My friends played the game at the party.
Passive: The boy was attacked by the vicious kitten.
Active: The vicious kitten attacked the boy.
 One of the most frequently used weak verbs is “to be” and its conjugations (am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been). In many cases, you can choose an active verb that is more descriptive and clearer. Examples follow:Weak verb: One way to write clearer is to use strong verbs.
Strong verb: Use strong verbs to clarify your writing.
"The writer makes an oversimplification on how hard it is to use strong verbs" would be stronger as "The writer oversimplifies the difficulty of using strong verbs."

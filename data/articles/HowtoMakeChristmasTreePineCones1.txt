 You can buy them at your local craft store if you're not near any pine trees. Alternatively, you can pick up pine cones from your backyard, the local woods or at a park. Just check that it's okay to take them from wherever you find them––always ask permission before going onto private land.


Gather up however many pine cones you want to turn into ornaments.






Choose good quality pine cones for your craft projects.

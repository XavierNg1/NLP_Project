 Death is always close at hand in Minecraft. Read about how to die in the section below. But if you don't want to lose all your items, read this section first.;
, Make a chest out of eight wooden planks. Place the chest on the ground, then move all valuable items from your inventory into the chest.


In single player, place the chest somewhere obvious, such as on the top of a hill.
In multiplayer, hide the chest underground to hide it from other players. Mark the land above it with a torch so you know where to dig later.
 These coordinates will tell you exactly where you are in the world. Check them while standing next to your chest:


In Minecraft for Windows or Mac, press F3. (If that doesn't work, press Fn+F3.)
In Minecraft for Xbox or Playstation, make a map, equip it, and use it.
Unfortunately, there is no way to find coordinates in Minecraft Pocket Edition. Try making a compass and following it back to your spawn point instead.
 Write down the X, Y, and Z values that appear as text at the top of the screen, or on the map. Use a real piece of paper, not just the chat box.
 Kill yourself any way you like. There are many methods listed in the next section below.
 When you respawn, you'll be back at the last bed you slept in, or your original spawn point. Use the method described above to display your coordinates. Write down these as well, so you don't get lost again.
 With the coordinates open, walk around and watch the X, Y, and Z values change. Find the direction that causes these values to approach the coordinates you wrote down earlier. When you reach them, look around for your chest. Pick up your items, and walk back to your spawn point using the same method.


X and Y are the North/South and East/West coordinates. Get these right first.
The Z value tells you how far you are above or below sea level. You can usually ignore this unless you died underground or on a steep mountain slope.
 This makes it so that your items are with you, even after you die.

 The basic method for breaking into a car with automatic locks without damaging anything is to wedge a space in the door and use a long poker to hit the lock button. It may be crude, but it's more or less exactly what a locksmith will do if you call one, except doing this won't waste you $80 bucks for five minutes of work. To do this, you'll need one wedge and one poker.Possibilities include:



The best wedges can include putty knives and door stops, the thinner the better. Ideally, you want to open up only as much space as is necessary to insert your poker. Locksmiths use an inflating balloon to pump air and create space.

The best pokers include the antenna from the car, unscrewed, and a straightened wire hanger. You might need a pair of pliers to straighten out the hanger, and consider doubling it up to have better control and pushing power when you get to the lock button. Pretty much any tool that is narrow enough to fit through the window crack and long enough to reach the lock button will work.;
, Jam a doorstop or equivalent wedge-like tool into the space between the upper part of the door and the car. Firmly tap the wedge into the door/car space using the heel of your hand.


If you are concerned about damaging your car's paint, cover the wedge with cloth or some kind of felted surface to protect the paint before beginning.
 The jammed wedge will create a gap between the door and the car body. Insert your rod into the space between the door and the car body. Guide the rod towards the lock button.
 Firmly press the button with your rod. It may take a few tries to get at it, but once you do, you'll have successfully broken into your car. Open the door and retrieve your keys.

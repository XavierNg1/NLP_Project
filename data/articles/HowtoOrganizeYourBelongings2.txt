 Any good organization system starts with a clean-up. Go through everything in your desk. If it's trash, throw it out. If you don't need it anymore and it can be donated or given away, do that. If you need it, great! Give it a wipe down if it's dusty or dirty, and then it'll be time to organize what's left.
 Putting distracting items there won't help you buckle down and focus on work, and keeping a ton of outdated files and papers in your workspace just adds to your clutter. Put everything away in its place, and only keep out what you need for your current work.
 You may need a pen or pencil and scrap paper at a moment's notice, to take down some notes or a memo. That way, if an idea comes to you, you can jot it down right away, before you lose it.
 Keep the things you frequently where you can find them quickly and easily (top drawers, shelves within arm's reach, etc), and move away the things you don't use regularly. It will help you to be more efficient.
 Whether it's part of your desk or in a filing cabinet nearby, if you have a lot of papers, start a filing cabinet. Organize school papers by subject/grade, or organize important documents like bills, legal/financial papers, contracts and so on by topic area or company.
 You might have a drawer for writing utensils and other office supplies, a draw for blank paper and notebooks, a draw for important papers (in addition to a full filing system, if you need one), etc. Only you can devise what system works for you, but once you have it, stick to it. Keep everything in its place, putting it back after you've used it.

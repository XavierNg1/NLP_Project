 If the lock in question is not attached to your own home, secure the property-owner's permission before proceeding. Breaking and entering is a serious crime in most places that can result in mandatory jail time.
 The ideal card will be a plastic card that is both stiff and somewhat flexible. Avoid using your actual credit or debit card, as it may get damaged in the process. A grocery store loyalty card makes an ideal choice, as does a laminated library card. Even a stiff business card will work on some locks. , Take the card, and slide it into the gap between the door and the doorjamb. Begin just above the door handle, and slide the card downwards and in. You may have to wiggle it a bit, but if you are lucky, the card will press against the latch assembly and allow you to open the door.








This technique only works on regular key-locks. It will not work to open a deadbolt.
Some doors open almost instantly using this technique, whereas others require more effort. Experiment with different cards, and different angles.
Remember that this technique only circumvents the lock, it doesn't actually unlock the door. If you let the door close, you could end up locked out all over again!

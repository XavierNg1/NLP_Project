 An older person can seem full of life and enthusiasm. Likewise, a younger person can be mature and have a lot of meaningful life experiences. Instead of focusing on the number, always focus on the person and how they make you feel.


If the difference in age does present an issue, make a list to remind yourself of why you fell for this person in the first place.;
, Being on the same wavelength means that you’re on the same page or that you are both thinking in the same manner. Determine what you both have in common: sense of humor, hobbies, values, goals, etc. and know that none of that can be limited by age.


This is also another chance to connect to your mate through sharing interests or learning new things about one another.
 Making prejudices and judgments before getting to know a person can be dangerous because it tends to lead to negative thoughts that can change behaviors towards others.The first step is to acknowledge that you have prejudices. For example, maybe you think that older men only seek younger women to make them “trophy wives.”After you recognize your preconceived notions, challenge the irrationality of them by examining how untrue they are. Seek out examples that disprove your prejudices.
 If age is nothing but a number then you should have no problem treating your mate with the same love and respect as previous (younger) boyfriends. Don’t put him on a pedestal and don’t think that he should be “more than” any of your other boyfriends: more mature, more established, more financially stable. Get to know him before passing judgment on whether or not he deserves your love and affection.If you find yourself expecting more from him, remind yourself that those are your prejudices creeping in. Challenge them by telling yourself that he is just like any other man.

 Lay your rope and crown knot on your table and, using your fingers or a tool, like a screwdriver or fid, loosen the weave of your rope below the end strand fastener. You'll need your end strands to pass through the main body of your rope to complete your splice.After you loosen the strands, divide them into one near (closest to you), one middle (in between the other two strands), and one far (farthest from you) strand. This will make weaving your splice easier.
 Take any one of your end strands and pass it above the near and far freshly loosened strands, but below the middle one. After that, pull the end strand through the loosened strands until no slack remains.
 Your next end strand will tuck under the near strand and come through the opening between the near and middle strands. Then pull the end strand so no slack remains.
 Your final end strand will pass under and around the far strand to come through the gap between the far and middle strands. After this, you can pull the strand until there is no remaining slack, much as you did the first three strands., Loosen the next twisting in your rope. Take the end strand you threaded around the far strand and pass it under the far and middle strands, but over the near strand. The strand that went around the middle strand should pass under the far strand. The strand that went under the near strand will pass under the near strand, but over the middle and far strands.








All end strands should be pulled firmly after passing through the loosened strands until no slack remains.
Depending on the length of your end strands, you may have to continue this pattern for several twists in the rope until the full length of your end strands is spliced.
 Pull on the ends of your rope firmly until the knot is solid. You can further tighten your spliced rope by rolling it in your hands. You should feel the rope tighten as you do so. Your spliced rope is now ready to use.

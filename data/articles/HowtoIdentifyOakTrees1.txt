 There are approximately 600 individual species listed in the Quercus (Oak) genus--most are trees, though a few are shrubs. Some are deciduous, some evergreen, some semi-evergreen.Oaks are mostly native to woodlands in the Northern Hemisphere, but they vary widely, from cold and temperate forests across North America and Europe to the tropical jungles of Asia and Central America.
Some evergreen oak trees (particularly certain American Species) are commonly called "Live Oak". This grouping name describes several species with an evergreen growth pattern, and it does not reflect any taxonomic classification group--in some cases, these species are only distantly related. Thus, evergreen oaks (Live Oaks) can be considered as a type of oak tree, but only insofar as they're an evergreen oak variety.;

In North America, oak trees are split into two main groups: "red oak" and "white oak". Red oaks tend to have darker bark, and lobed leaves that come to a point; white oaks tend to have lighter bark, and leaves with rounded lobes.Common "white oak" species include chinkapin oak (found in limestone-rich soils), live oak, blackjack oak (found on dry ridges), shingle oak (found on moist slopes), swamp chestnut oak (found in wetlands), white oak (found in various ecosystems), swamp white oak (found in wetlands), and overcup oak (found on stream-banks, in marshy bottomlands).Common "red oak" species include water oak (found near stream-banks and lowlands), northern red oak (found in various habitats), southern red oak (found on moist and dry slopes), scarlet oak (found on dry slopes), willow oak (found on moist slopes), pin oak (found in wetlands), and cherrybark oak (found near moist slopes and bottomlands).

 Inhaling mold spores is very unhealthy for your respiratory system. For this reason, it's important that you get a respirator or a facemask that can filter out the spores. You can purchase an N-95 respirator at most hardware stores or online., Wearing a pair of thick goggles will prevent mold spores from getting into your eyes. Wear them when cleaning the mold on your grout and don't touch your eyes, mouth, or nose while you clean. Afterward, make sure to shower and wash your hands., Do not touch mold with your bare hands. Instead, purchase a pair of natural rubber, neoprene, nitrile, polyurethane, or PVC gloves that go up to your elbow. This will keep your hands safe from the mold and chemicals while you clean., Seal off vents by placing a sheet of polyurethane plastic over them and sealing up the sides with duct tape. When you clean mold, the spores will often go into the air and can get stuck in your heating ducts or vents. Sealing them off while you clean will prevent the mold from spreading to other parts of your house., To further prevent mold from being spread to other parts of your house, make sure that the room your cleaning is well-ventilated. A fan can push the mold spores outside, instead of spreading them around your house.

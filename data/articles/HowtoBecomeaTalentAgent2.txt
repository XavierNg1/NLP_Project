 You are essentially a salesman, and your product is the talent you manage. Salesmen do not sit and wait for people to come buy from them, so you shouldn’t either. Call casting agencies and directors and pitch your talent to them. Besides calling, you should create business cards, flyers, and postcards for your agency and your talent.


You want as many people as possible to know about you and your talent, so never think that you’ve made too many contact attempts.
Make postcards with your talent’s photo and skill set listed, as well as your name and contact info. Send these postcards out to any casting agency or company that you think might be interested in hiring your talent. Call the places you sent postcards after a week or so and check in with them.
Flyers could be placed around town promoting your agency and calling for new talent to contact you to see about a representation contract.
 You may not book a gig on your first contact attempt, so continue to pursue it and don’t give up. Don’t sit and wait for clients to call you. Contact the same people consistently at intervals of a week or two. Eventually they are likely to offer you something. The most persistent agents are the ones that succeed.You have to constantly put your name and your talent out there if you want to secure gigs. Talent agents who put a few attempts out there and then rest won’t succeed.
You will face rejection often as a talent agent, but you have to learn to shrug it off and move on to the next opportunity. Don’t let setbacks stall you.
 As a talent agent, you will have to balance many conflicting schedules from clients and talent. Make use of an online calendar and input everything into your schedule. iCal and Google Calendar are good options. Keep track of contact information like phone numbers and names, as well.Make sure your talent is available for potential gigs and make sure they get to the gig on time. Missing opportunities makes you look bad.
Start using a calendar immediately and learn to schedule your life. If you don’t always know what you’ll be doing, at least write it down after it happens so you get used to recording events.
Keep a detailed contact list or catalogue with any clients that you meet or hear about so that you have what you need to contact them as soon as you have the chance.
 Talent agents are middlemen between the talent and the clients who need to hire talent. Develop exceptional people skills and make the most of every interaction. Be friendly with potential clients and talent as well as anyone you already have a contract with. If you are easy to work with, more people will want to work with you.Go the extra mile to help someone out to show that you are a team player who wants everyone to succeed. Your success only comes from the success of your talent and your clients.
 When you are lining up a job for your talent, you are responsible for working with the client to decide on payment. The client needs to make money to pay the talent so you can also earn money. Continually work to master the art of negotiating for the best possible contract for everyone involved.Clients want to get your talent for as little possible, so you may need to push them to offer you more money. Find a balance between pushing too far and not getting enough for your talent.
You also have to work out an appropriate commission with your talent. You may decide on a standard rate or you may have a flexible rate depending on how much work each person gets.
Make sure to get a contract between you, the client, and the talent in writing for every job or gig you set up. You always want proof of the agreement that is reached.

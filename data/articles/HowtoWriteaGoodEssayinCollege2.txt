 Get a pen, some paper, and paper printouts of your sources. The reason to write it in paper form with paper sources is that you can spread the material out on a table, and will allow you to see if one source conflicts with another, or if one article states a fact better than another.
 Your map should let you, at a glance, see the flow from idea to idea, placing the first idea you want presented in the beginning, and the following ideas placed in the order you'd like them to appear in the essay. This will allow you to see what the progression of the essay will be as you write it. Make it pretty neat because you'll use it throughout the rest of the essay process.
 Do not put a lot of emphasis on the spelling of complicated words, or picky punctuation. Just get the basic ideas stated in a manner that you can both understand later and expand on. The first draft is the place to get a very general layout going that will allow you to see what the final product will look like.
 Once you have a first draft that puts all the ideas you wish to incorporate into the essay on paper, and feel that you are prepared to make a second draft, take a 15 minute break away from the work. Try not to think about the essay during the break. If you want to have a snack, go for it.
 Use it to acclimate yourself with what you are going to write, and in what order you intend to write it.
 Try to form sentences that, while they may not be correct from a grammatical standpoint, they allow you to get the ideas on paper in more detail than those in the first draft. Keep the first draft close at hand and refer to it often. At the end of this writing session you should have an essay that clearly states at the top what the essay is about, and elaborates from there. Include source references when they are relevant, and that back up the text you put it with.

 This is absolutely essential. You can't just pick up a violin and play it straight away, it takes a substantial amount of time to learn and you will likely need several years experience before you can tackle complicated songs.;
, You can learn songs by ear but it's better if you can read the actual notes.Note: Only treble clef is used in violin music.
 Buy books of sheet music in music shops (make sure it's for violin though), or try the internet. Also try learning by ear.


If you're a beginner, try nursery rhymes. (You'll probably do this if you have proper lessons anyway.)






Although they aren't really songs as such, you can learn a lot from playing classical music. (Again, the kind of things you'll likely do in lessons, if you have them.)






Country music would be a good idea to play as violins are often used.






Same goes for pop; you will often hear some violins in amongst the guitar, bass and synthesizers.






You could try rock and metal, but usually these kind of genres' music focuses much more on guitars. However, if you really want to play rock/metal songs on violin and have had a good few years experience, consider learning a bit about guitars and guitar tabs; this will open the door to a world of online tabs which you should be able to adapt for violin with some knowledge and skill.

Review letters of complaint addressed to the teacher from students, other teachers, administrators or parents.

Create concise yet detailed notes. For example, if the teacher is having difficulty disciplining his or her students, write "Classroom behavior management" as an area that needs improvement.



Collaborate with the teacher to work out how gains will be made. For example, if a teacher is having difficulties with classroom behavior management, a set of action steps could look like this: "1) Shadow another educator within the same grade who displays excellent classroom behavior management, 2) Participate in an informative workshop, 3) Create an individual discipline plan for your classroom, 4) Implement your plan."

Come to an agreement with the teacher about the evidence necessary to prove progress. With the behavior example, a fair measurement might be a decrease in students sent to the principal's office or a decrease in unruliness during classroom observations.



Discuss with the teacher a reasonable time frame in which he or she can implement the changes.
Notify the teacher of the consequences if he or she does not improve within the agreed upon timeline.



Include in-school mentors, teacher improvement centers and handbooks that might be helpful.

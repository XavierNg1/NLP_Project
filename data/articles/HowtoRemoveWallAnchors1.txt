 Some anchors have threaded screws that need to be removed before you can reach the collar. In these cases, use a screwdriver to turn the screw counterclockwise until it is loose, and then remove it., Use needle-nosed pliers to get underneath the anchor and grip it. Grab the edge of the collar, then pull out and snap it off.The collar is a small circular piece of metal that holds the anchor in place, so that it cannot be pushed backward, out the other end of the wall.
Be gentle when you attach the pliers. You don’t want to gouge the drywall. Try to avoid touching the drywall with the pliers.
 Once the anchor has been removed, you can use a screwdriver to push the anchor out through the other end of the wall. The screwdriver shouldn’t be larger than the diameter of the wall anchor because you will want to be able to push it through the wall without making the hole bigger. , The wall anchor should fall into the frame, behind the drywall. You will be left with a small hole to patch.

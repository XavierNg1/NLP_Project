 Pet food made especially for hedgehogs does exist; however, it is not very common in pet stores. Hedgehogs can also eat (and seem to prefer) high quality cat food. They need a diet high in protein and low in fat. When it comes to kibble, avoid:


by products, animal digest
"animal fat"
Blood Meal
beet pulp, pea hulls, brewer's rice, wheat gluten
corn (this includes any kind of cornmeal)
BHA, BHT, Ethoxyquin -- these all cause cancer
sweeteners (corn syrup, sucrose, propylene glycol...)
coloring additives
nuts and seeds

, Hedgehogs also enjoy crickets and meal worms as treats or sprinkled on top of their food.

When it comes to treats, avoid:

grapes/raisins
avocados
oranges/lemons/lime/citrus anything
nuts or seeds
chocolate
milk/dairy products (exception is cottage cheese and that should be only a little)
alcohol
bread
celery
onion and onion powder
raw carrots
tomatoes
human junk food (chips, candy, anything really sugary, etc.)
honey
raw meat (ANY meat you feed a hedgie should be cooked!)
Wild caught bugs
Make sure the crickets and meal worms have been fed nutritious foods, such as vegetables and fruits.

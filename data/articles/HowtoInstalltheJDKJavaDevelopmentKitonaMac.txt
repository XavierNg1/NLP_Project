, Once you're on the Downloads page, you'll need to navigate to the installer files:


Click the "Java" option.
Click "Java SE."
Click the "Download" button next to "JDK 8 with NetBeans."
Select "Accept License Agreement" and then click the download link for "Mac OS X" in the top section. This is the most recent release of the Java SDK with the NetBeans development environment.
 The installer is in .dmg format. Double-clicking it will open the installation interface.
 You'll be asked to enter your administrator password before installation can proceed.
 This will help you save on disk space, since you don't need it after the JDK has been installed., This is the development environment for Java, and will allow you to easily write and compile code.
 This will start a new project in NetBeans.
 This will set NetBeans to create Java files for this project.
 For this example, call it "HelloWorld." This will open the code editor after the project is created.
 Your program code will go underneath this line.
 Press ‚èé Return after the "// TODO code application goes here" line to create a new line with the same indentation. Type the following code:





System.out.println("Hello World!");




, This looks like a green Play button, and can be found in the toolbar.
 This frame will appear at the bottom of your screen after running the project.
 If the project doesn't have any errors, you'll see "Hello World!" and "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" in the Output tab. If there are errors, you'll see which lines they occur on so that you can go back and fix them., Now that you have the JDK installed and working, you can continue learning to program in Java.

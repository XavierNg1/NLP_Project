 To convert Kelvin to Fahrenheit instead, you simply use the same formula, but in reverse. The formula for converting Kelvin to Fahrenheit is F = y K x 9/5 – 459.67.For example, to convert 320 K, you'd use the equation F = 320 K x 9/5 – 459.67

, Remember that 9/5 can also be written as 1.8.


In the example of 320 K, the answer to step one is 320 K x 9/5 = 576.
 Once you’ve multiplied the temperature in Kelvin by 9/5, simply subtract the Fahrenheit temperature of absolute zero (-459.67) from the product.


In the example of 320 K, the answer to step two is 576 – 459.67 = 116.33
The answer to 320 K x 9/5 – 459.67 = 116.33
Therefore, 320 K = 116.33 °F

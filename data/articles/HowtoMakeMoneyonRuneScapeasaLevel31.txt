 Now you can mine rune essence, and craft runes. Each time you take a load to the Air Altar, you will gain a level until about 15, which means fire rune time! You can also craft minds, but watch out--the altar is 4 squares away from the Wilderness.;
,, If you are not just in it for the money, craft what runes you need and train with them to get up your magic level. Runecrafting makes magic a lot cheaper. If you care to get more money without training your stats, go to world 16 and request assistance from a person that says 8x 9x or 10x then craft your runes. This only works on world 16 and you have to be at the air temple.

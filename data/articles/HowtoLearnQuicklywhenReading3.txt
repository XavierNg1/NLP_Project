 Marking the text serves as a way of anchoring what you've learned––you can find the ideas again quickly and it will also remind you of the initial thoughts you had when reading these marked portions. Methods of highlighting will depend on what you're reading, for example, if it's your own book or the library's or if it's printed on paper or read on a screen.
 If you read this way, you will always have questions and comments on the reading for class discussion and your teacher will think you are a conscientious, engaged student. The method works as follows:


Find 2 highlighters and a pen.
The first highlighter is for key points and things you want to remember. (Be judicious—only highlight a few items per page.)
The second highlighter is for things you don’t understand, questions, and places you disagree.
The pen is to write comments in the text. (Writing comments keeps your learning active and helps you remember the content you read.)

, Instead, make notes on cards, slips of paper, or in a separate notebook.
 Some formats also allow on-screen highlighting, comments, and other ways to mark up the text.

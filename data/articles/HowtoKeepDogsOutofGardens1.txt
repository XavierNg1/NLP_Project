 Perhaps the most obvious way to keep dogs out of your garden is to put up a fence. You can pay to have a fence installed professionally (which can be expensive), or consider erecting one yourself. You may choose a fence made from wood, wire, or mesh, which can all be found at your local home repair store.For small dogs, a 16” fence should be adequate.
For large dogs, you may need a taller fence or a fence with a top-enclosure.;
, If you don’t find a traditional fence aesthetically pleasing, you can use plants to form a barrier around your garden. Tall, sturdy plants or shrubs are your best bet for this purpose. Although thorny or prickly plants can deter dogs, they may also cause some injury.You might consider:


Tall sturdy plants, such as peony, cone flower, verbena, Russian sage, Mexican primrose, and black eyed Susans.
Shrubs, like evergreen, laurel, escallonia, and huckleberry.
 Dogs dislike the texture of gravel and mulch against their paws. So, another option is to create a mote-like barrier around your garden using these substances.Mulch is available at most hardware stores. Mulches made from pinecones or needles are good options. You do not want “dog-friendly” mulch for this purpose!
Gravel is available at many hardware stores and greenhouses. Select rocks with rough edges to best deter dogs.

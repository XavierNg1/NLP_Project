 The key to being confident is to not focus on the negative or things that you cannot control.You cannot control if you have freckles, instead focus on what you can! Be confident in the clothing you own.


Practice outfits you think you want to wear and stand in front of a mirror. Determine if they show off your freckles (or downplay them) in a way that you want.
 You can minimize or dramatize your freckles depending on what type of shirt or blouse you wear.


For example, if you want to show off your freckles you can wear a simple t-shirt, boat neck, or square neck shirt to show more skin and more freckles.
If you want to hide your freckles, you can wear longer-sleeve blouses or high-necked shirts (like a turtle neck).
 Or, get a haircut that flatters your face. A haircut is a great way to change your look. If you want to draw attention to, or away, from your freckles, doing your hair in a specific style might be a great way to do so.


To draw attention to your face, try a short cut like a bob or a pixie cut.To draw attention away from your face, try a sweeping updo or keep your hair loose and long.

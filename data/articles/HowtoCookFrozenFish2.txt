 The colder the thawing temperature, the less likely that harmful bacteria populations will grow on your fish. Thawing overnight is the recommended method whenever you have the time.Keep your fridge below 46ºF (8ºC) to keep your fish safe, and cook with 48 hours.


Frozen foods will produce water as the ice melts, so keep your fish in a container that can catch water. To avoid waterlogging your fish, you could punch holes in the base of that container, and place it above a second container that will catch the draining water.
While most fish will thaw within 8 hours, massive amounts of fish could take up to 24 hours.
 If you don't want to wait for hours to thaw your fish, seal it inside a zip locked bag and submerge it in cold water.This method usually takes 1–2 hours per pound (0.45 kg) of fish, and is the fastest method that still retains quality.


Never use water at room temperature or warmer, as this encourages the growth of bacteria.
 This method is not recommended for most circumstances, since the uneven cooking will usually make part of the fish rubbery before the rest of it is defrosted. It is typically much faster than the other methods, however, taking about 3–6 minutes per pound (0.45 kg) with most microwaves. Check on the fish halfway through, and flip each piece over.
 Once the fish is pliable, meaning it is no longer stiff, it is fully thawed. Cook it as you would a fresh fish, or take a look at the recipes section for ideas.


Note that the fish will still be cold once thawed.

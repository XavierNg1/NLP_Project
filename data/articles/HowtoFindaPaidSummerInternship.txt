 Use your interests, experience, education and goals to find an internship suited for you. In addition to knowing the type of internship you are looking for, you should also have some clear ideas about what you hope to get out of the internship. For example, you may want to find an internship in marketing, and your goals may be to gain experience, establish industry contacts and put yourself in line for future employment within the company you intern for.;
, Whether you are in high school or college, your school's guidance counselor should be able to point you in the right direction when it comes to finding paid internships over the summer. Employers often list their internship opportunities with schools; as well, many schools offer their own internship programs.
 The people you know can be a great source for internship opportunities. Tell your friends, family, coworkers, teachers and acquaintances about the type of internship you are looking for, and ask if they know of any such openings.
 For example, if you are interested in serving a summer internship training under an architectural engineer, you may search the phone book and the Internet for architects and architectural firms in your area and ask if they offer paid internships to qualified students.

You may be able to find a summer internship in the free classifieds listings of sites like Craigslist.
Consider interning abroad. There are a multitude of summer internship opportunities available to those who are interested in going overseas, and websites like GoAbroad.com help you find them.

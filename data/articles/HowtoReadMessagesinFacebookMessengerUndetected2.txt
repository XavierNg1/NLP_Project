Unread is an app that lets you read your Facebook messages without getting them marked as seen.
 Locate the app on your mobile device and tap on it.
 In order to use Unread with your Facebook account, you have to authorize it to link with Facebook. Tap the “Tap to Sign In” button to authorize the connection.


If you’re already logged into the Facebook app on your mobile device, you won’t be asked to log into Facebook anymore.
 Upon logging in, Unread will show you your current inbox or list of message threads or conversations from Facebook Messenger. Swipe up and down to scroll through them.
 New messages on your Facebook Messenger will also come in on Unread. Tap on the message to read it. The person who sent you the message won’t be able to tell if and when you have read his message.


As long as you use Unread as your Facebook messenger, you can read your messages in peace and in secret. Once you go back to using the main Facebook Messenger, your messages will go back to sending read receipts.

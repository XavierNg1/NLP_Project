 Buy a moisturizing agent that can act as the “cream” ingredient to your foundation.


Facial moisturizer that is made specifically for sensitive face skin works best, but plain, mild body lotion can be used too.
Body lotion is a cheaper choice of moisturizer, but it may also irritate or dry out your skin., Use a small makeup brush to carefully mix your eye shadow and moisturizer in a bowl.


If it is your first time making homemade foundation, you may choose to make a smaller amount until your recipe is perfected. Try halving the amounts.
This is the amount recommended for powdered eye shadow. Cream shadow foundation suggests other amounts.
 Blend 3/4 teaspoon of cream eye shadow with only 3/4 teaspoon of moisturizer.


A moisturizer reduction is necessary with cream eye shadow to prevent the foundation from being runny. This is because the eye shadow itself is already creamy.
 Mix the foundation in a bowl with a makeup brush until thoroughly blended.
 See how quickly the foundation runs off of a spoon. This will determine if it is too thick, too thin, or just right.


Scoop a small amount of foundation with a spoon. Tilt the spoon so it is mostly upright. If the foundation runs off the end quickly, it is too thin and needs more eye shadow added to the mixture. If the foundation sits on the spoon and barely moves, add more moisturizer. If the foundation slides from the spoon at an easy, slow-to-medium pace, it is a perfect consistency.

 Black is a strong neutral that can hold its ground against a red dress without stealing the show. Tie a black belt around your waist to break up the monotony of a solid red smock dress and finish the look with black fashion boots.
 Black can look strong and classy, but the right black accessories can really turn up the heat. Wrap a black lace shawl around your shoulders for evening or carry a clutch with a layer of black lace. Complete the look with your highest pair of black stilettos.
 If you want to make your red summer sundress look classy, adorn yourself in white accessories like while bangle bracelets and white sandals. Avoid black, which may look too heavy for warm summer months.
 A black cardigan in a luxurious material coordinates nicely with an evening dress, but a white cardigan works best for day dresses.
 Patterns create added visual interest, but a simple black and white pattern keeps it subtle. Try a black and white polka dot handbag for timeless appeal, or get a little edgy with a large zebra print shoulder bag.
 A simple pearl necklace, matched with small pearl post earrings, can create a classy, elegant look, especially when paired with a white or cream shoe.
 A simple necklace or tennis bracelet adorned with black stones is a good way to add a small trace of black to your outfit.

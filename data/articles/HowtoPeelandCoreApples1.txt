 For best results, start at the top of the apple and circle down the circumference of the apple. When done correctly, the peel should come off all in one piece.

To remove the apple core using an apple corer, insert the apple corer tool in the center of the apple while pushing and twisting. Remove the core by pulling the apple core out. You may need to scrape any remaining apple seeds with a paring knife. Insert the paring knife into the apple and scrape gently until the seeds are removed.
Alternatively you can elect to remove the apple pulp from the core by slicing the pulp away from the apple. To do this take a sharp knife and cut vertically along the side of the apple. Turn the apple and repeat this three times until all four sides of the apple are sliced away from the core.
 Usually, a recipe will either call for apple wedges or apple cubes.









To cut wedges, set each quarter so that the round side is facing up. Then, cut each wedge in half to make 1/8 inch (3.4mm) slices.
To cut cubes, set each quarter on the cutting board so that the round side is facing up. Then, cut the quarter lengthwise into strips approximately 1/3" (3.4mm) wide. Finish by cutting it width-wise into strips approximately 1/3" (3.4mm) wide. The result will be many 1/3" x 1/3" (3.4mm x 3.4mm) chunks.

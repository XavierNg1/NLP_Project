 Real estate agents, or realtors, come into contact with hopeful home buyers and generate mortgage leads on a regular basis. Solicit referrals from real estate professionals in the following way:


Look through local real estate magazines and search online real estate office sites to identify realtors who have a lot of listings.
Either stop in to the real estate offices or make telephone calls and leave messages in order to establish initial contact. Follow up your office visit or phone call with another phone call, asking to speak specifically with the realtor you're targeting.
Once you have the realtor on the line, explain who you are and what your mortgage office has to offer to the realtor and any mortgage lead they refer to you. Ask to make an appointment to meet face to face with the realtor so you can present yourself and your company's loan products to the realtor. It may take a few tries to convince the realtor of the need for an appointment and you may have to repeat this step several times. Be persistent.
 Approach homeowners who are selling their homes without the help of a realtor. They are able to make their own choices regarding the advertising and financing of their property for sale, and may allow you to place signs advertising your mortgage loan services alongside their FSBO signs.
 Realtors often have open houses during the weekends, where they hold a house they have listed for sale as open to the public in order to allow potential home buyers to walk through and explore the home. Open houses are generally listed in the classifieds, and are also advertised by way of street signage.


Ask to leave business cards and your company's brochures in a conspicuous place for potential home buyers.
If you develop a relationship with a realtor, you may be able to sit for an entire open house in order to greet potential home buyers as they tour the house for sale.

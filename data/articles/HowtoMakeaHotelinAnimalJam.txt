 Try to add hotel like interior and arrangements, such as tables for workers to stand by, TV's, tables, chairs, pillows, and the couches for beds, of course fencing or shoji screens for separating the rooms. If you'd, like, you can even add a second den for a cafe next door and change/clean it in between meals, or include it in your current den if you have enough rooms.

If you are a non-member, you can still make a small den work. Just use the shoji screens to separate rooms, and add a second small den if you want a cafe next door.

 Check in now!" Until you get enough people. Try not to be away too long or drama may happen.

 If that doesn't work, tell them one of them will have to find a different bed.
 You could make a little restaurant for them to eat at in a lobby area, or as stated above, you could build a restaurant/cafe right next door. You could use tables from the dinner party, a cake bake kitchen from epic wonders, and anything else that looks like a restaurant and hire cooks. Also stated above, make sure that you change/clean it in between meals.

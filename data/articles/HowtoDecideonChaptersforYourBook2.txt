 Try keeping one main idea for each chapter. However, be flexible. Some chapters may use more than one idea, if each one doesn’t cover much ground.


Some ideas may need to be expanded over two chapters or even three, especially if it is a major plot point. Is the hero trying to figure out his love life? Maybe that will take more than a single chapter.
 No set standard exists for the number of words per chapter. They can range anywhere from 2,000 words to 5,000 words, depending on what needs to be said. Some novels don’t even have chapters, per se, but are just divided into two or three major sections.


On the other hand, major sections without chapter dividers would not work for an academic book. Remember chapters are signposts. They give your reader an idea of what’s coming and a chance to stop and take a breath. Chapters help break up your material in manageable chunks for the reader.
 Chapters can easily be broken up into smaller sections. In academic works or nonfiction books, you can use major headings in chapters to help make information manageable.


In a fiction book, you can break the chapter up into major scenes, though you don’t use headings. The standard practice is to use an extra line space between scenes or three centered asterisks to divide up scenes in a novel.
 The order you decide on in your outline may not work when you actually begin writing. Rearrange ideas and chapter as needed, though always check to make sure you change any references to other chapters when you need to do so.
 When moving from chapter to chapter, provide some introduction or transition to the next chapter. It’s even possible to do so in novels, by providing a bit of foreshadowing about what’s ahead.
 A long chapter can be divided up into two smaller chapters, but don’t do it if it makes it awkward.

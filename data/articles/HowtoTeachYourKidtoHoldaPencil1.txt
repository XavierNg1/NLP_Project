 Using short pencils, like golf pencils or normal pencils broken in half, can help children find the right grip on their own. Short pencils have less room for unnecessary fingers, so your child has little choice but to use the correct three-finger grip.


You can purchase short pencils at most craft and office supply stores.;
, Pencil grips are simple devices placed on a pencil to encourage children to hold the pencil correctly. In most cases, the grip slips easily over a pencil and rests around the area where a pencil is held. The grip is shaped in a way that helps to guide your child’s hand, while the sticky material keeps his hand in place once he’s gripped the pencil in the correct way.


Pencil grips are available at most learning and office supply stores, or online. They are relevantly inexpensive, so consider experimenting with a few different types until you find the one that fits best and is most comfortable for your child’s hand.
 A simple homemade alternative to a pencil grip is to slide a pencil through a clothespin and have the child hold onto the clothespin between his thumb and pointer finger.


With the pencil through the round cutout near the end, the child can hold onto the long, flat ends and the pencil will stay in a position that allows your child to pinch and hold it with three fingers.
 Soon, your child’s hand will automatically hold the pencil correctly thanks to muscle memory. Once they can hold the pencil correctly on their own, you can remove the pencil grips and have your child use normal pencils.

 The tailoring and structure of a suede jacket determines how formal the rest of your clothes should be. Feel free to wear slacks, a tucked dress-shirt and a belt with a structured shape and a slim silhouette., Most suede jackets will look great with deconstructed jeans. The contrasting textures make a perfectly stylish outfit that looks effortless. Wear ripped jeans with bombers, motos, boxy and slouchy suede jackets.
 Wear a classic neutral suede color, like tan or gray, and give yourself the perfect canvas for statement slacks. Wear bright white slacks with a nude suede jacket, black leather pants with a gray jacket, or leopard pants with black suede.
 Springtime has its fair share of chilly days. On the ones that start and end colder, throw on a light-colored suede jacket with shorts. Look for suede in light grey-blue or blushed pink and pair it with twill or jean shorts.

 Check for signs of gingivitis or other gum disease, which can both cause drooling. These include swollen, red, or bleeding gums. Also check if your cat’s gums are receding or pulling away from its teeth. Treat the gingivitis or gum disease to stop drooling.Brush your cat’s teeth regularly.
Take your cat to the vet for a more thorough cleaning.
Consult with your vet about possible tooth extraction.
Get antibiotics for any infections in the gums.
Look for signs of teething in your kitten. Teething also causes drooling.
 Look for any foreign objects that might be lodged in your cat’s teeth or mouth and cause drooling. Also smell your cat’s breath because a foreign object lodged in the mouth for a long time can cause bad breath. You might also see that your cat is pawing at its mouth as though it’s trying to dislodge something stuck in there.


Try to remove any objects stuck in the teeth or mouth.
Bring your cat to the vet if you cannot remove foreign objects from the mouth.
 Drooling and pawing at the mouth can indicate that your cat has an abscessed tooth. Look for other signs of an abscessed tooth, like loss of appetite, nosebleeds, sneezing, fever, less interest in playing and grooming, loose or discolored teeth. An abscessed tooth can also cause bad breath.Have an abscessed tooth lanced and treated with antibiotics. Sometimes the tooth will need to be removed.

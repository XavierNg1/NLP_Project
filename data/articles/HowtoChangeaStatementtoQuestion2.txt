 If the statement has a singular subject and a verb in the simple present tense, add "does" to the beginning of the sentence. Change the verb to its base form, dropping all special verb endings.Here are a few examples:


He cleans the bedroom. → Does he clean the bedroom?
A year consists of four seasons. → Does a year consist of four seasons?
My cat listens when I talk. → Does my cat listen when I talk?

, If the subject is a plural noun and the verb is in the simple present tense, add the word "do" to the beginning of the sentence. Use "do" when the subject is "you" as well.


They greet their teacher. → Do they greet their teacher?
The protesters call for change. → Do the protesters call for change?
You throw stones at my window. → Do you throw stones at my window?

, "Did" is also used when the verb is in the simple past. It does not matter whether the subject is singular or plural. Even though the question is still in the past tense, change the verb back to its base, present tense form.


He saved the cat. → Did he save the cat?
The sheep jumped over the fence. → Did the sheep jump over the fence?
He broke my oven. → Did he break my oven?
Remember, a simple past tense verb has no helping verb. If you see the word "was" or "has" in front of a verb, you'll need to use the helping verb method instead.
 Statements with the verb "to be" do not need any extra words to turn into questions. Just move the verb in front of the subject.


I am happy to see you. → Am I happy to see you?
You are going home. → Are you going home?
He is thirsty. → Is he thirsty?
I was tired. → Was I tired?
You were happy. → Were you happy?
My father will leave tomorrow. → Will my father leave tomorrow?

For other forms of "to be", use the same rules as helping verbs: move the first word only. For example: The horse has been angry. → Has the horse been angry?

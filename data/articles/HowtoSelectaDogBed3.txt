 Perhaps the most important consideration when choosing a bed for your dog is to pick one that can be easily cleaned. Dog beds need to be cleaned often to control odors, fleas, and dirt. The outer cover should be washed every week or two., While you definitely want your dog to be comfortable in its new bed, you also don’t want this feature to dominate the room it is in. Dogs tend to prefer that their beds be situated in a quiet area of the house that doesn’t get a lot of foot traffic. That way, your pet will be able to escape for some alone time when necessary.Many beds come in different fabrics or designs, so you can look for one that coordinates with your other furnishings.
If space is a concern, you may be able to find a corner bed that you can tuck away in previously unused space.
 If you tend toward an earth-conscious lifestyle, you can purchase beds made of used materials like recycled plastic bottles. Similarly, many dog beds and covers are now offered in 100 percent organic materials, so you can keep your eyes out for those as well.


These types of beds and covers can be more expensive than other choices, but they are often highly durable so they last longer.
Natural rubber is a common option for filling earth-friendly beds.
 It is easy to go overboard when buying a bed for your dog, since you want your pup to have the best of everything. If you don’t have a price in mind before you start to shop, you could very well end up regretting your shopping spree at a later time. Prices can range from $15–$30 for elevated pet beds to $115–$190 for nest-type beds.


Look at big box retailers, small pet shops, and online stores to compare prices and features.
Don’t forget you may need to periodically replace your covers or even your mattresses if they become excessively soiled or worn. Keeping this in mind while shopping can help you make a sensible financial decision.

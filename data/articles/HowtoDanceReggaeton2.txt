 A classic Reggaeton dance move is often referred to as "perreo," which means "doggie" and refers to the move's explicit sexual overtones. The man stands behind the woman and both grind their hips and shoulders in time to the music, imitating a dog's sex act.


When you dance perreo, it's important to keep in constant body and skin contact with your dance partner. Rubbing and rubbing up against each other conveys strength, warmth, energy and desire.
 When it comes to men, much of reggaeton is about posturing and machismo. For women, it's about desire and turning on and being turned on by your dance partner.


If you're a man, seek out a rival and join him in dancing with a woman. One of you should dance in front of her, the other behind. Do your best to out dance your rival and use your sexuality to woo the woman.
If you're a woman, take turns dancing with both of your dance-floor suitors. When the dance is over, choose the one who did the best job of making you sweat.
 It doesn't matter what your body type is when you dance reggaeton; that really counts is a fashionable outfit.


If you're a woman, it's all about showing off your best assets. Tight pants and tops that display rather than conceal the body are the norm. Dress in a way that makes you feel sexy and is likely to attract a guy's attention. Don't worry if you have a little extra weight around your hips; "love handles" are considered desirable.
If you're a guy, go for well-known brands. You can even pull off an imitation of knock-off brand if it has a big, flashy logo. Also popular are loose, baggy shirts with the names of North American football and basketball teams. A pair of huge sneakers, caps, sunglasses and backpacks are all accessories that add a flair of authenticity to your look.

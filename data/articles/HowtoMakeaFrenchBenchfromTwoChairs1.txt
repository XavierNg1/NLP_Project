 Actually you want the chair frame to still be in decent condition, but if you don’t like the style or if the seat isn’t working for you, you should have a good base to use.;
, Visit the home improvement store to find plywood to create the bench seat and possibly a small shelf underneath. 1″x 2-1/4″ pieces may work well.

You’ll need enough plywood to make two long rectangle boxes inside the bench (sizes will vary from the back of the two chairs to the desired bench length). If you plan to add a shelf, you will also need pieces of wood to make the slats.
Purchase a flat piece of plywood that will become the actual bench. Measure the width and length to arrive at the right size.






Pick up several 3” screws (at least seven) that will be used to pull the bench together.
Don’t forget to purchase or find your electric drill to make the process go quickly.
 Go for something that is made for furniture or try a stain if all the wood is the same color.

Consider picking up nail hole fill. To make the job look professional, you’ll want to cover the screws and nails before you paint.
 Cover the plywood seat with the batting and then create the seat by covering and adhering to the bottom using a staple gun or Super Glue.

 Getting your mouth ready for a huge change is really important because its going to feel awkward anyway so preparing is always a benefit.;
, Many of you know you should clean your teeth twice a day - make sure you definitely do this, clean your teeth as soon as you get up, have breakfast clean then again if you must, and before bed. If you can use an electric toothbrush it is a lot more effective. If you can't, don't worry just don't forget the two minutes.
 If you're not used to flossing don't rush because you could cut your gums, and honestly you really don't want to cut your gums just because of your braces. Ouch!

, Make the most of the time without braces this may be difficult because you probably cannot wait to get your braces on but as soon as you do, you'll be missing your fudge!

, It's good because liquids (with no sugar) can keep your teeth healthy as they wash out bits of food.

 Be sure to include coffee mugs or any other dirty cup that needs a good washing.;
, Fill your kitchen sink with very hot water, enough water, that is more than half, but less than to the very top. Add a squirt of dish soap in the water, and on a sponge, and make sure your sponge is wet, with dish soap on it. Put in all the cups into the hot water in sink and start cleaning. Once you are done with the cups, you can wash your plates, cutlery and cooking utensils.
, Coffee stains, and other stains, need some work to get clean, so scrub a little harder, but also let all the cups soak in the hot water longer, for that gets the stains looser, and easier to get clean.
 Rinse off the soap and water, and make sure you rinse well in very hot water.
 Some people like to buy a rack to hang your cups, so the water drips off the cups. But, if you want your dishes to be done quickly, hang your cups on a rack. When you're done washing all the dishes, wipe the dishes with a cloth towel. You might want to wash your towel after drying the washer.
 Put away your clean cups, and other dishes in a cupboard, or somewhere safe from getting dirty, and where you can grab one with out breaking a cup or other dish.
 Purchase and place a kitchen rug near the sink. If you drop a cup during the washing, it's less likely to be broken and one under where you will gather cups from time to time.

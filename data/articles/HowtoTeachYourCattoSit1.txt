 Using a clicker involves reinforcing positive behavior with a sound. When the cat does something you approve of, like squatting towards a sitting position, reward the cat and hit the clicker. Try to avoid rewarding the cat without the clicker noise so there is no confusion about why a reward is happening.Initially you may have to use the clicker with a treat without any action by the cat, just to get the ball rolling.As a substitute for a clicker you can use a ball point pen. ;
, Begin the process by making a specific, repeatable sound before feeding the cat. Preferably, this sound can be before opening a can of cat food. Once the cat associates that sound with food, the sound can be used for specific training without food. When you see your cat start to move towards a sit, make the vocal cue. If the cat sits, make the same sound.


A great way to use this vocal training is to simply get your cat to come to you. After the cat has made a solid association, initiate the training in small steps.Don’t allow your cat to jump for the treat. The same vocal cue strategies used to reinforce positive actions can be used to tell your cat that the treat isn’t permitted without sitting down.
 Try putting a bell at your cat’s eye level and showing it a treat. When the cat wants something and starts to meow, ignore it. When the bell is rung, however, look for the cat to sit and reward it immediately. Ignore destructive behavior. Wait for the desired reaction (e.g. squatting towards a sit or actually sitting).

 You won't have a video if you don't know how! If you know someone who can animate, you might be able to get them to help.;
, This is the basic concept of your video, and you'll use it when making the video. It is also around this time that you should put up a casting call to put together a crew, or you can ask people you know to join.


Characters: You could use the characters from the canon, or write your own characters. Make sure any characters you write aren't overly perfect, or "Mary Sue" characters.
Setting: This can be just about anywhere in Equestria. For example, Ponyville, the Everfree Forest, or anywhere else. You can even make up your own towns if you want.
Plot: This is the story of your video. Think of it as writing a fan fiction.
 Be sure to make it sound natural.
 Make sure that the movement doesn't look robotic. Study how characters talk and get the facial movements just right.
 Don't end up sounding like you're just reading off of a script. Express the emotions of the characters by changing your tone as the situation varies. If you can't voice-act for any particular reason, search for some voice-actors/actresses.
 This is also a good time to add music and sound effects (such as hoof beats, etc.).

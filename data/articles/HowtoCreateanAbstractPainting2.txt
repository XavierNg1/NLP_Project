 Quite simply, a color wheel is a circular tool that features a variety of colors. It's useful for showing the relationship between colors - what looks good together, what clashes, and so on.Find a color wheel at a local artist supply store, craft store, or paint department.
 At their most basic, a color wheel is divided into three parts: the primary colors (red, blue, yellow). Secondary colors are created by mixing these primary colors together (green, orange, purple). Tertiary colors can me made by mixing the primary and secondary colors (yellow-orange, red-orange, red-purple, blue-purple, blue-green & yellow-green).To become familiar with color creation, try making your own color wheel.
 Warm colors, such as reds, yellows, oranges, tend to create a sense of movement and advance in space. Cool colors, like blues, greens, purples, recede or show little movement. They are calming colors.White, black, and gray are seen as neutral colors.
 Several formulas exist for choosing colors that work well together. Try:

Analogous colors: Choose two or three colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. One of the colors will probably stand out, but all three will look great together.






Complementary colors: Choose two colors that are directly opposite of each other on the color wheel. These colors can really pop out.






Triadic colors: Choose three colors that are evenly spaced on the color wheel. If you drew a line to connect the colors you chose, you would have a triangle. These colors will really stand out.

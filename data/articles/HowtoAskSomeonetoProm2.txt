 You don't have to ask someone to prom in an elaborate and creative way. If you know your potential date is a no-frills sort of person, he/she will probably appreciate a kind and sincere direct invitation more than an elaborate one.
 When you two are alone, start out with a normal conversation and try not to be too nervous or act differently than you normally would.


This way you don't make the other person feel pressured by yours or their friends.
 Remind your prospective date of fun times you have had together in the past. After a bit of build up, ask if he or she would like to go to the dance with you.


Say something as simple as, “You and I have so much fun together. Would you like to go to prom with me?” or “I don’t know if this prom is going to be fun or not, but I know I would have a good time with you. Would you go to prom with me?”

 This pretty lip gloss requires ingredients you can find at most health food stores. Gather up the following supplies:


1 tablespoon Shea butter
2 tablespoons sweet almond oil
1 tablespoon chopped beeswax
5 drops vitamin E oil
An old tube of lipstick in the color of your choice

, Set out your lip gloss pots or tubes to ready them for pouring.
 Place it in the top part of a double boiler and simmer the wax until it melts entirely. Stir it until it's nice and smooth.
 Stir the ingredients with the wax until your mixture is smooth and glossy.
 Stirring in a small chunk of lipstick in any color you like will tint the gloss a lighter version of the same hue. Stir the lipstick well until it's completely combined with the gloss ingredients.









For darker lip gloss, add the entire stick of lipstick and stir well.
Add 5 few drops of rose extract or another scent if you'd like.
 Wash the pot right away so it doesn't end up permanently caked in gloss.
 It's ready to use after 2 hours or overnight, once it has completely cooled.

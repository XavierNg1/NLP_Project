 This assumes you're running version 5.3 or later of Skype., You can find this in the upper left hand corner of your profile. Clicking on it will open up a new page that allows you to change your picture.
 This will bring up the picture editor.
 There are three different ways that you can do this:


Click on the recent-pictures drop down menu to choose a picture you've used before.
Click the camera button to take a picture of yourself with your webcam. Wait for the countdown from 3 to 1 and smile for your picture.
Select "Choose..." to browse your photos to find another photo on your computer.
 This will save the picture. If you're not happy with how it looks, you can resize it by moving the slider back and forth. You should be all done after this.

 If you want to get good, practice, and I'm not telling you to go out and do level against computer normal, or to go FFA of 6 against 6 computer easy. Buy an original Warcraft CD and play on BNET. And practice with your race. If you're good as human, play as human, if you like undead but really can't play it, and you're good as Orc, then either you get good with UD or play Orc. Don't just play a little with one race and then try another one, and then go back to the race you were playing before. Maybe play a few games with each race and then you choose the one that's best for you and... PRACTICE.;
, Find out who is one of the best in your race (I'm not talking about your friends, I'm talking about the pros) and watch his or their replays, and try to take something out of it. For example, if you're Orc, watch Grubby's replays and find out what he does against what and how he does it, and do it yourself. After that, practice what you have learned. PS: for a website of replays, go to www.wcreplays.com.
,, If you are not a good rusher, don't rush, unless you really have the advantage, and if you have the advantage but can't rush because he has towers, creep, move around your opponent's base, and ALWAYS attack his units if you find him, because you normally have the advantage against someone who has towers. Another option is tower rushing him, but that takes some skill to be done successfully.
,, This helps especially so you don't accidentally block out just enough room to fit in your altar, etc. This also helps prevent from wasting the precious seconds in the beginning of the game from stalling and decision making.

 You can purchase adjustable collars for under $5 a piece. You’ll need three different sizes:A collar that fits your rabbit’s neck.
One that fits around his chest just behind his front legs.
A long collar that will be used as the connecting piece.
 Be sure to leave the leash attachment ring intact so that you will have a place for the lease to attach.
 Put the collars around your bunny’s neck and chest. Lay the third collar along his back between his shoulder blades, with the ring for the leash in the middle, and mark the points where the third collar overlaps the far side of the other two collars.
 Fold each end of the connecting piece over just past the point where you marked it. Sew the folded over ends so that you create loops at each end., Once you have passed the collars through the loops on the connecting piece, your figure-H harness is ready to use.

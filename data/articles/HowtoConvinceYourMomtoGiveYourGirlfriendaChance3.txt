 If your mom sees her coming to watch you play football, helping you study, or gushing over your artwork, that will help your mom realize that your girl appreciates you for you (not just your boyfriend status).


You could say to your girlfriend, “Hey, my mom is still a little weird about us dating. Would it be okay if we make sure you come to the same games of mine that my mom does so she sees you there each time?”
If your girlfriend has an innocent gift for you, why not plan to have her give it to you in front of your mom?
Parents have invested much into your life, and they love you an awful lot. It is natural for them to want you to date someone who is willing to invest in you too.
Of course, this goes both ways: let your parents see you taking an interest in your girlfriend’s larger life as well.
 Your girlfriend doesn’t have to pretend to like everything your mother does to win over her affection. If your girlfriend is friendly and respectful while still being her genuine self, your mom is more likely to warm up to her.


Everyone can benefit from learning to be courteous while disagreeing with someone.
 Your mother’s hesitations will lose steam when your girlfriend acts like a respectful and integrated member of the family already. For instance:


If your mom doesn't like you using your cell phone during dinner, remind your girlfriend not to text during those times.
If your mom dislikes profanity, let your girlfriend know!
If family members remove their shoes when they walk in the door, don’t shirk the rule for your girlfriend.

 This position should be used only for toddlers. If your baby is over a year old and mobile, start by placing your sling on a bed or other flat surface.
 Place your baby on the sling. Make sure that the width of the sling is spread from his or her knees to his or her armpits.
 Sit in front of your baby’s feet, facing away. Reach for both ends of the fabric, and pull them toward you, bring your baby against your back like a backpack.
 Pull both ends of the fabric up and over your shoulders, then across your chest and around your midsection.
 Bring the ends of the fabric to your back. Secure it with a knot under your baby’s bottom.

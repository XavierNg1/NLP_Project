 Building and destroying oak larders are the best way to level up your construction. Build an observatory in your house, and then a mahogany demon or Eagle Lectern.
 Buy at least 1,000 soft clay and law runes. You can either have an air battlestaff or an earth battlestaff, however buy the rune that you do not have the staff in with the same quantity as your law runes.
 Go to Ardougne just north of the market. Talk to the Butler Master about buying a butler. The demon butler gives you the most money, however costs the most to hire and the most to keep using. When doing this method, keep a few hundred thousand in your money pouch to pay your butler.
 As you run out of money, call your butler and ask him to fetch 25 soft clay from the bank, the maximum he can carry. After 5-7 tasks he will require a 10k payment, and toggling this as auto helps speed up the process. The tabs stack, so banking is not needed.

 Set a large skillet on the stove over medium-high heat. Do not add any oil to the skillet.Since pork belly contains so much fat, adding extra oil isn't necessary. You can do so to speed up the browning process, but be aware of the fact that the addition of extra oil increases the likelihood of oil splatters.
 Using a sharp knife, cut the pork belly into 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6 to 12 mm) thick slices.


You do not need to score the skin when pan frying pork belly. Cutting the meat into slices exposes enough of the fat, so it should render well enough even in spite of the thick skin layer.
 Place the slices of pork belly in the hot pan and cooking, turning often, until both sides of each slice are golden-brown and crispy.


The exact amount of time can vary depending on how crowded the pan is, but 4 to 5 minutes per side will usually be enough time.
Use tongs to carefully turn and rotate the slices. If the oil begins to splatter, use a splatter screen to minimize the mess.
 Once the pork belly is well-browned, drain the excess fat and add the honey, soy sauce, and oyster sauce, and garlic.If puddles of fat remain on the slices of pork belly even after you drain the pan, you may need to dab off the excess fat using clean paper towels.
Consider mixing the seasoning ingredients together in a separate bowl before adding them to the pan. Doing so can ensure an even distribution of flavors.
 Reduce the heat to medium, then continue cooking until the sauce thickens and coats the pork belly like a glaze.


You'll need to continue flipping and rotating the slices so that all sides are coated in the sauce.
The exact amount of time may vary, but expect this part of the process to take roughly 2 to 3 minutes.
 Remove the pan from the heat and serve the pork belly slices with their glaze.


You can store leftovers in an airtight container kept in the refrigerator. Reheat them on the stove to maintain the crispy texture of the meat.

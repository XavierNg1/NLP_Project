 The more stuff you have, the more of these you'll need.


Label some boxes as Keep, Donate/Sell (whichever you want to do), and Belongs Elsewhere. Don't label all of them.;
, This means your floor has to be clean! Put the things from your floor into a box/boxes.
, Ask yourself the following questions:


How often do I use this?
Can I throw this away?
Does it belong in here?
If you don't use it often, get rid of it! If it's trash, put it in the trash bag! If it doesn't belong in your room, put it in a box for later (if you labeled the boxes, it will go in the Belongs Elsewhere box)
If you are keeping it put it in a different box than the other things (if labeled, it's the Keep box)

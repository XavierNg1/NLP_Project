 For example, commit to using 20% less water per month.;
, Print the energy and water consumption chart and post it in a visible spot in your home. Chart the number of gallons of water used in the last 12 months (for comparison to each month this year).
 For example, buy water saving products where needed, such as a low-flush toilet and a water-saving showerhead.
 For example, place signs near water outlets reminding family members to reduce consumption (e.g., shorter showers, turning the faucet off when not needed, only watering outdoor plants in the morning or evening).
 Once a month, add the new usage information to the charts and make adjustments as needed to reach your goals.
 If you have children, increase their allowances by the amount saved to encourage them to get involved in finding new ways to conserve.

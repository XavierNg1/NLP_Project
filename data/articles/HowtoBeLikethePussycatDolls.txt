 The Pussycat Dolls love to mix styles with a variety of colours and designs. They also know that being hot isn't all about the clothing -- it's about how you present the clothes. Try wearing clothes that accentuate your natural features. Don't try to be like other people because that's a no-no. Also, forget about wearing clothes that don't fit you. If you're a size six, you're not going to fit in a size two!;
,,, Make sure you take voice lessons to keep your singing on tempo and consistent (if you can't afford - don't bother!). Make sure you join a choir at school and if your school has a swing choir, join it!

, The Pussycat Dolls are never scared to flirt. They love spending the afternoon getting cozy with their crushes. So, at school, don't be afraid to sweet talk/compliment him on that new shirt or ask him for a pencil during class to get his attention. This works! Eventually, you will have a ton of guys to flirt with and will be singing "Loosen up my buttons baby" before you know it.

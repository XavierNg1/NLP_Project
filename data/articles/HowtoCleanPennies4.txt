 This cleaning solution works on all copper quickly, like pennies and copper bottom cookware. If you don't have this brand, another metal cleaner (like Brasso) should work as well.
 The oxalic acid takes away the gunk. Let it sit for a few minutes.
 Your pennies should now be so shiny you could signal planes, call Batman, or invoke temporary blindness. Doesn't get much easier than that!

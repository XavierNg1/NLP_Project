 Your child will probably not like a food the first time they eat it. Your child may be resistant to new, unfamiliar foods. Sometimes, toddlers get into a pattern in which they want the same thing every day for every meal. This doesn’t mean you give up teaching your child to eat new foods. Keep giving your child new foods and eventually your child will become accustomed to the new foods.Research states that it may take a child 10 to 20 times of trying a new food before they accept it and start eating it.;
, Toddlers don’t eat as much as adults. Especially if you have a picky eater, you don’t want to put too much food on the plate. Presenting your toddler with portions that are too big can overwhelm them.Set out small amounts of each food. Try starting with a tablespoon for each food you serve.
If your child likes the food, add more food.
 You control what your toddler eats. This means you can teach your child healthy eating habits from the start. Focus on well-balanced, nutritious meals and eliminate unhealthy foods and junk.Fix meals with lean meats, vegetables, whole-grains, fruits, and low-fat dairy.
Reduce the amount of foods you serve with high levels of fat, sugar, cholesterol, and sodium.
 To help ease your toddler into eating new foods, serve something familiar that they like with each meal. This helps give your toddler something to eat combined with new foods to try.If your child loves pasta, make pasta along with a green vegetable and chicken. If you kid loves macaroni and cheese, make that with fish and carrots.

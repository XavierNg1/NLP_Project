 That's your two types of flours, baking soda and powder, salt, sugar, and pumpkin pie spice or nutmeg. Mix together with a whisk.









Of course, pancakes from a box are also an option, but making it yourself is just so much more fulfilling (and tastier).;
, Combine with the dry ingredients the milk, vegetable oil, and eggs. Mix well until you have a definite batter -- if it's too thick or thin, add more milk or flour, respectively.
 A good way to do this is to slice the banana in half the long way and dice it up from there. Try to keep all the pieces uniform in size.









Some may choose to mash up the bananas and stir it in aggressively with the batter. That's also delicious!

, After the bananas are delicately combined, walk away for a bit. Letting the bananas rest in the batter helps incorporate their flavor throughout.









Towards the end of this time, turn on your stove and let your pan or griddle heat for about 3 minutes on medium. Spray on some cooking spray.
 About 1/2 cup of batter makes for a good-sized pancake. Spread it out a bit (sometimes when it's thick it doesn't move easily) with the bottom of your spoon, ladle, or cup to desired size.









Leave it on this side for about 90 seconds, depending on your stove, pan, and heat level.
 The fun part, right? If it doesn't lift up easily, it's not ready. And don't worry -- the bananas, if anything, make flipping it easier. Lift up a bit of the edge and check to see if it's the right shade of brown.









A good tool to use are the bubbles that crop up. Once you get a fair amount, start checking.
 Ta da! Serve alone or in a stack with whipped cream, syrup, strawberries, walnuts, chocolate chips, or with nothing at all -- any way they're delicious!

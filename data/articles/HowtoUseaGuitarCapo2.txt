Search for chord maps online or at a music store if you are having trouble playing a specific chord.
 If you are playing in a group, you'll all want to play in the same key so that your music sounds cohesive. There are seven chords for each key, and they correspond with the seven chords in each key scale. The capo position will change the chords you are playing, thus altering the key that you're playing in. Move your capo up and down the neck to change the key that you're comfortable playing in.


The progression of chords within a scale takes the pattern of major, minor, minor, major, major, and diminished.

Using this pattern, you can see that the chords in the key of C are, C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, and A diminished.
 Using a capo further down on your neck will brighten the tone of your guitar and make it easier to write happy or upbeat music. Other than helping match your vocal registry, use the capo to make your open chords sound happier. Experiment with different positions further down the neck and see what kind of sounds you can create.
 Look online for a transposition chart for guitars with capos. These charts will tell you exactly which chord you're playing depending on where your capo is positioned.Take some existing music you already know how to play and place the capo on a fret. Once you're done with that, correspond which chord shapes you need to use to match the chords you'd normally play without a capo.

, When you use a capo, you can use the same open chord shapes or forms, but the chord notes will be different depending on where you placed the capo. Much like a barre chord, the capo holds down all the strings on a particular fret. This means that the same chord shapes that you're used to playing in the open chord position will now emit different tones with the same finger positioning on the guitar's neck.

Moving your capo up one fret will move your chord up a half step or half-tone, while moving the capo up on the guitar's neck for two frets will move it up a full step or tone.
For example, a C form played with a capo on the first fret has now become a C#. The G chord form played with a capo on the first fret turns into a G#, moving the chord up one half-step.
When moving the capo up to the second fret, your C form has now become a D and your G becomes an A, moving your chord up a full step.

 Use a measuring spoon to measure out two tablespoons of baking soda and dump them into the boiling water. Use a wooden spatula or spoon to mix the powder with the water. Once you're done, empty out the kitchenware and dry it off with a rag., Pour a tablespoon of baking soda into a bowl and slowly add cold water and mix them together until it forms a paste that's a similar consistency to toothpaste., Spread an even layer of the paste that you created over the inside surfaces of your Le Creuset. You can do this with your hands or a paper towel. You can also use the paste to clean the outside of your Le Creuset pan or pot.
 The paste will start to absorb some of the stains created from burning your Le Creuset., The next day, fill a spray bottle with distilled white vinegar. This will help clean the pot or pan, and will break up the hardened baking soda paste.
 Grab an old toothbrush and dip it into the paste that you just created. Go in a circular motion across the burnt parts of your kitchenware until there is no more baking soda paste.Avoid using abrasive scrubbers like steel wool because they can scratch your Le Creuset.
 Rinse your Le Creuset under cold water and dry it off with a cotton rag. If the burned stains remain, you can repeat the steps until they start to lighten.

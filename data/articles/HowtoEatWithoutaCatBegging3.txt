 If you do not dine in front of your cat, you can eat without it begging. Place your cat in another room and close the door. Alternately, place it in its crate. Then, sit at your dining table and enjoy your meal. When finished, end your cat’s confinement., If your cat sits on the dining table – whether you’re dining or not – it will begin to think that it is acceptable to be there. During mealtimes, a cat on the table might be emboldened and start begging for food or even snatch food right off your plate. Prevent this situation by shooing your cat off the table, or physically picking it up and removing it.If you have other people living in your home, you can ask them to help you ensure your cat does not sit on the table.
 Place your cat in a location away from your dining table. Give your cat a treat with one hand and click a clicker (a pet training device) with the other. Repeat four or five times in several different sessions throughout the day. After a week or so, continue to situate your cat in the same place away from your dining area and continue to click the clicker each time you do so, but reduce the frequency with which you administer treats.Never give your cat treats less than half the time you use the clicker.
Eventually, you will be able to click the clicker just before you dine, causing your cat to leave the dining area.

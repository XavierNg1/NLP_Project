 The kind of Frisbee you want to use is one that is the 175 grams (6.2Â oz), which is the official weight for the game of Ultimate Frisbee. There are plenty of companies that make official ultimate discs, but a few include Discraft, which seems to be the most popular, and Wham-O, who were the inventors of the original Frisbee Flying Disc. All official Ultimate Frisbee discs are flat on the top, with the outside sloping down to a vertical lip around the entire circumference of the disc. The bottom looks like a flat bowl, or a plate with a vertical lip. This shape allows the most control and distance for the thrower.;
, When wind is a non-factor, the flying disc will go exactly where your muscles send it since there will be no outside force to blow it off course, slow it down, or even speed it up. As well as no wind, warmer temperatures (above 70 degrees Fahrenheit or so) are preferred, as warmer air will keep the Frisbee flying for a greater distance, and warmer temperatures are generally just more enjoyable. However, for health and safety reasons DO NOT practice these throws outside if the temperature is severely low or high, you are not comfortable with the current conditions, or the weather is too dangerous to be in for an extended period. Additionally, you may want someone to throw back and forth with, as retrieving your own throws can get quite tedious and boring! Now that we have gone over what we need to know before, we can move on to the mechanics.

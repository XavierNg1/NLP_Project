 If you only have a few crabs, using a nit comb to remove pubic lice and nits is one of the simplest and most cost effective treatments for the parasite. The treatment is also time consuming as it can take up to 14 days to manually get rid of all lice and nits. It is very common to combine this technique with another natural treatment., Petroleum jelly suffocates the lice on your pubic hair. Apply petroleum jelly generously to the pubic area. Make sure that the jelly covers the base of the pubic hair to make it easier to remove nits with a nit comb. You may apply petroleum jelly as many times as needed to get rid of the lice and nits.


Be aware that regular petroleum jelly should not be used to treat pubic lice and nits in the eyebrows or eyelashes because it can be very irritating to the eye. However, your doctor can prescribe an ophthalmic grade petroleum jelly that can be applied to the eyebrows and eyelashes., Trimming pubic hair as short as possible will increase the effectiveness of other treatments for pubic lice, whether natural, over-the-counter, or prescription. It is important to note that just shaving pubic hair is not an effective treatment for pubic lice, as they may simply relocate to other hairy areas of the body.

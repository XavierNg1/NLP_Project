 Egg Incubators can be used to help your Pokémon Eggs hatch faster. After purchasing an Egg Incubator, tap on an Egg in your pack and tap "Start Incubating" to catalyze this process. Egg Incubators cost 150 PokéCoins in the PokéShop.


Egg Incubators break after three uses.
 Bag Upgrades, as you might've guessed, allow you to hold more items at once. They can be especially useful if you intend to spend extended periods catching or battling Pokémon, so that you don't have to interrupt yourself to stock up on items. Bag Upgrades cost 200 Pokécoins and increase your storage space by 50 items.
 In a similar vein to Bag Upgrades, Pokémon Storage Upgrades allow you to carry more Pokémon at the same time, which can allow you to level up and evolve your Pokémon more quickly by giving you more space to carry around duplicates. Pokémon Storage Upgrades cost 200 PokéCoins and allow you to carry 50 more Pokémon at one time.

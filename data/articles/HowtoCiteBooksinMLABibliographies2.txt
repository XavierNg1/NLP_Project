 For books with two or more authors, add their names after the first author in alphabetical order, placing the first names first.


For example: “Jones, Bob, Jess Jopp, and Jon Kowlaski. Leaves and Trees. Odessa, Texas: Cowboy Books, 1999. Print.”
If the book has more than three authors, you can add the authors in the same way or use “et al” after the first author’s name: “Jones, Bob et al. Leaves and Trees. Odessa, Texas: Cowboy Books, 1999. Print.”

, If the book doesn’t have an author, you should use the title first to prevent any confusion.


For example: “Leaves and Trees. Odessa, Texas: Cowboy Books, 1999. Print.”

, If the book is a particular edition, add the edition after the title.


For example: “Jones, Bob. Leaves and Trees. 2nd ed. Odessa, Texas: Cowboy Books, 1999. Print.”

, For an essay or story contained in an anthology, use both the author’s name and the editor’s name, as well as the story or essay title.


For example: “Knopp, Carly. “Why Leaves Change.” Leaves and Trees. Ed. Bob Jones. Odessa, Texas: Cowboy Books, 1999. Print.”
In this case, Knopp is the author of the essay “Why Leaves Change,” which is in the anthology Leaves and Trees that is edited by Bob Jones.

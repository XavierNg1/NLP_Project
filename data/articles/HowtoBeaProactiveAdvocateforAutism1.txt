 Many autistic people are active in the community, running support and social groups. Others maintain blogs, Youtube channels, podcasts, and other online presences. By finding those who are spreading autism awareness, you will be able to discover the best group for you to join and connect with. A group can not only support you emotionally and physically but also help you make quicker progress in projects for autism.


Do your research. Before joining a group or participating in a project, gather as much information as possible. It is best for you to be aware of what you're joining in order to protect yourself.;
, Being an advocate means doing what is best for the people you support. Autistic people are aware of the objectives they wish to complete, so find out what they need and support them in reaching their goals. Each person has different desires, but here are some common goals:


Fighting stigma
In-home care for autistic people who don't want to live in group homes or institutions
Normalizing sign language and electronic communication devices in public
Spreading autism acceptance, not just autism awareness (which promotes rather than combats stigma)
Calling for an end to controlling and abusive therapy practices

, Once you know what the autistic people around you want, help them communicate that to others. There are many ways to do this, such as helping with fundraising, organizing events, reading speeches at events for people who fear public speaking, etc. In order to reach goals, you must take action and help autistic people step forward by supporting them rather than being passive.

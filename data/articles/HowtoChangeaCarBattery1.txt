 You don't want to spend time and money installing a new battery if the problem is not with the battery itself. Take the following three things into consideration:

Look for sulfate build-up in the form of a whitish or blue residue around the terminal — removing this can sometimes solve issues with a faulty battery. This residue may indicate a bad seal around the battery terminals and is leaking the acid out onto the terminals. Note: do not touch this powder with your bare hands, as it can often contain dried out sulfuric acid which will begin to burn your skin.



 


Verify that the battery has been given the chance to recharge properly by driving constantly for 30 minutes (with minimal electrical usage, including the air conditioner).
Finally, you should check the alternator. Some cars also have a battery meter, with the engine running, the alternator usually maintains a charge close to 13.8 – 14.2 volts in a properly functioning charging system. The battery should have 12.4 – 12.8 volts with the engine off, and with no accessory load.

, Find out what kind of battery you're replacing (or the dimensions of your battery) and bring this, your car's make, model and engine size information to a local auto parts store. This is important because automotive batteries vary in size and electrical capacity and you will want to purchase a battery which matches the size of the battery tray/support in your vehicle.

In some areas of the US, you will be charged a "core" fee when you purchase a new battery, if you bring in your old battery after or when purchasing your new battery you will not get charged this fee.

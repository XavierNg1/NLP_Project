 Not only does milk get rid of a feeling of spice, it also gets rid of a feeling of sourness.
 If you want to completely get rid of that annoying flavor, eat something spicy, despite the fact that it may leave your mouth burning while you hope for relief.Please note: If you don't like spicy foods and are afraid that you will burn your mouth, eat little spicy food, or don't eat any at all.

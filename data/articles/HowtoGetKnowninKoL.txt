 You can't play KoL without an account. Fill in the information, get your activation code, and log in.;
, The rules on KoL are unlike most online roleplaying. They are short,basic, and easy to follow rules so don't break them.
 Go to town, click on the right side of the tracks, and you'll see it. Pay attention to the test and it will be fairly easy to pass. Once you have done it, you will gain access to chat.
 And say hello a good example is "Hey, I'm new to KoL.". If you capitalize and spell correctly you'll get a warm welcome from the players in the newbie chat.
 Read a couple of the sentences the players put in, until you find something to reply to. If the conversation is something you don't want to talk about or you can't add to play the game until a new conversation comes up. Or change channels. Put in /channels and a list of channels that you're allowed in will come up (you'll unlock new channels as you progress the game) if you want to go to a certain channel put in /c ( insert channel name).
 If you get stuck on something in the game, feel free to ask for help. Once again, correct grammar and spelling will help. Most veterans would love to help you.
 You will start to be disliked and you will be banned from the chat for a period of time (depending on your number of bans) if you get 10 bans, you will be banned forever.

 The swing beat is a common jazz rhythm that is easy to imitate with a pencil. If you’ve ever listened to jazz or swing music, you’ll be able to recall this beat. Try counting out 1-2-3/4, and for the 3/4, don’t pause like you do between 1 and 2. Once you start to get a feeling for the swing beat, you can add your own varieties., Snare rolls are a type of drum fill purely performed on a snare drum. Play a snare roll by holding a pencil in each hand. Count out 1-2-3-4 1-2-3-4, but alternate your hands after every hit. You can keep time by tapping your foot in half time. Start slow and work your way towards a fast snare roll, or in this case, a pencil roll.
 Paradiddles are drum exercises you can practice to improve your rhythm and coordination. Most paradiddles consist of a 4/4 tempo where you alternate between your left hand and right hand in a specific way. A paradiddle played in 4/4 means that each hit falls on a number when you repeat counting 1-2-3-4. This is an example of a 4/4 paradiddles explained in right hand (R) and left hand (L) :


R-L-R-R-L-R-L-L, Carry around two pencils and play when you feel the urge. The beauty of playing on the go is that you can play on any given surface. This is a great way to sample various sounds. For example, a pencil hit against a chain link fence will sound different than one hitting a metal pole.


Finding different sounds can benefit you if you like to record sounds outside of a recording studio.
Bring a field recorder with you and document any sounds that stand out to you.

 Can you become so interested in something that you're willing to do it for the next 50 years? Are you doing it because you're interested or are you doing it for the "glory"? People who go into physics because they want to be the next Feynman or Einstein are soon disappointed. You have a successful career in physics because you enjoy it and find it compelling.;
, It's a tough road, but very rewarding. You get to use your mind for a living, which is a rare privilege. You'll work with people from around the world. The time flies when you're really into a subject. And you get to grow old with other physicists - for the most part you'll find that they have wonderful senses of humor: quirky and creative.

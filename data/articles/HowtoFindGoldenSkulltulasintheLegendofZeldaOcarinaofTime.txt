 Most Gold Skulltulas hate light, so they are hiding during the day. You can play the Sun's Song to change the time quickly.;
, Bugs can be bought from either the Castle Town Market (past) or from the Medicine Shop in Kakariko Village for 50 Rupees per bug. They can be found under rocks in most places too.
 For example, inside the first dungeon (Inside the Deku Tree), there is a Gold Skulltula that requires the bombs and the boomerang.
 When you kill all the Gold Skulltulas in an area, an icon will appear by the name of the area.

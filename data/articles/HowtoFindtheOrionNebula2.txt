 In other words, hold your star chart in such a way that the compass directions are aligned in the same way your body is. If, for instance, youâ€™re facing south (as you should to see M42), hold the star chart in such a way that the southern edge of the chart is at the bottom and the northern edge is at the top. Ensure your star chart is for the current season.
 Unless you have an exquisitely detailed star chart, the Orion Nebula will not be explicitly labeled, though it should appear as a point on the chart. However, using the star chart to locate nearby objects in the night sky will help you find it.


The Orion Nebula is located just to one side of the line between Alnilam (the middle star in the Belt of Orion) and Rigel in the constellation Orion. These and other major features of the night sky will provide relative guide you to where you can locate it.
There are several major stars and constellations around M42 which can help you locate it. The Belt of Orion is one such constellation. Locating it with your star chart should be easy.
The constellation Orion is a major constellation and lends the Orion Nebula its name. Orion is located at the intersection of Taurus, Lepus, and Gemini.
 Your star chart will mirror the appearance of the night sky. Think of it as an astronomical map. With the chart in an overhead position, you can easily identify the various stellar objects in your quadrant of the sky. Find the stellar objects you identified as near to M42, then use their relative positioning to find it.


If your star chart does have a label for M42, your job is much easier. Use it to locate the nebula.

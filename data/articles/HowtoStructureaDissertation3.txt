 It is not necessary to include all results discovered through the research. Only the most relevant to the dissertation’s scope and research are necessary. Do not interpret the research. If there are significant findings or data, that should be left for the later portion of the dissertation where everything is explained.Cross-reference text with pertinent visual aids (i.e. figures, graphs, tables).
 The dissertation should be organized so that chapters are focused on a specific question. The questions could be wide-ranging, based on a thought-process, an aspect of your methodology, or other issue related to the research. Be sure the chapters not only address t he questions, but answers them., Once the research is done, the chapters should support a central idea you’re attempting to make. They should support what you are attempting to prove through your detailed research and methodology.Help support your argument by avoiding debatable statements related to the chapter’s questions.A few examples follow:


Debatable – Approximately 60% of the voters supported the referendum.

Non-debatable – Microprocessors are smaller today than they were 10 years ago.

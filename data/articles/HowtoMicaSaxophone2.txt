 In practice, this process is very much dependent on the mics your sound engineers have access to.


In general, you will want to use to use a large diaphragm condenser. Some high-end microphones include the Neumann U87, AKG C414, Mojave MA 200 and the Blue Bottle Rocket. Audio-Technical 4047, Shure KSM27 or a Rode NT1A are quality, affordable microphones that will produce good results, as well.
Some engineers like using ribbon microphones. But these are not only expensive, they are also at risk of being damaged due to the high SPLs that a saxophone produces.



Make sure the microphone is not too close to the bell. A general rule is that the mic should be about 3 feet (0.9 m) away from the bell, pointing down at a 45 degree angle between the player's bottom hand and the bell.
Don't center the mic over the bell. It's best if it is off-center by about 12 inches (30.5 cm), pointing inwards towards the instrument. This technique will produce a very rich, full sound even, if there is little room ambiance.
To achieve a larger, more open sound, move the microphone back and experiment until you achieve the desired sound.
 The standard cardioid pickup pattern is ideal for the studio. Some microphones allow you to switch the pickup pattern to a "figure 8" or an "omni" directional pattern. These patterns will capture the sound from the source and pick up room sound at the same time.

 Making major cuts in your shirt is far from the only way to distress it. For instance, with nothing more than a simple disposable razor, its' simple to make small nicks and worn patches in your shirt. Simply drag the razor across the portions you'd like to wear as you would while shaving.
 Another way to make your shirt appear naturally worn is to replicate the patterns of wear and tear that are common on actual worn-out shirts. The seams in any piece of clothing are natural points of wear, so tears and cuts in these areas will look especially natural. Fold your shirt along the seam, then use a sharp pair of scissors to make small cuts parallel to the seam. For an authentic look, try making multiple cuts of varying sizes. Below are a few ideas for locations for your cuts:


Along the seam around the neck hole
Along the seam at the bottom of the shirt
Along the seams at the ends of the sleeves

, To give your shirt a pattern of small rips and holes, use an everyday cheese grater. Stretch the fabric of the shirt as you grate it to ensure the sharp "teeth" of the grater can dig into the fabric of the shirt. You may find this easiest to do if you secure the grater to a sturdy post or pole first, then rub the shirt against it vigorously.
 One of the biggest difficulties when it comes to distressing shirts is that it's tricky to make a shirt's screen printed design look as worn as the rest of the shirt. The ink used for screen printing is relatively thick, tough, and resistant to most distressing methods. To replicate the effects of years of wear and tear on your screen printed shirt, use a square of sandpaper to abrade your screen printed design. For a natural look, wear the design unevenly.

 You'll need a full set of sheets, both fitted and flat, in at least full size. Queen and even King size sheets may be needed for larger couches.;
, Remove all of the movable cushions off of the couch.
 Lay the flat sheet over the sofa so that it creates a skirt in the front and drapes all the way around to the back.


You may need to orient the short sides at the arms of the couch, or they might need to be at the back and front. It depends on the size and shape of your couch.
 Replace the cushions on the couch, keeping the sheet looking nice and straight where it shows through at the front.
 Now place the fitted sheet over both the seat cushions and the back cushions (if there are back cushions). Tuck the sheet as you go until it looks nice and uniform over the cushions.
 Now you'll want to cover the arms of the couch. Take the pillow cases and drape them over the arms of the couch, lengthwise so that the front of the arms are covered. Tuck and pin the fabric until it looks nice.


This method leaves the sides of the couch exposed. If you have tables or other items on the sides of the couch, this won't matter. However, if the sides of your couch will be visible, use folded blankets draped over the side, to keep the sides disguised.
 Now all you have to do is cover and place some pillows to make the couch look more normal. You can use pillow cases on normal pillows or you can cover or reuse loose pillows that came with the couch.

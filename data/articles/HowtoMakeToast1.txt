 Whether white, wheat, or rye, traditional soft sandwich bread makes excellent toast. It's always pre-sliced and results in a uniform toast that's perfect for making crunchy sandwiches or as a side to breakfast dishes.


Soft white breads and other sandwich loaves tend to toast much more quickly than more hearty breads. Watch these kinds of bread closely to make sure they won't burn.;
, If basic old white toast doesn't do it for you, try working with a denser crusty bread that'll yield a chewier toast with a crispy edge. Head to your local bakery and look for round loaves you can slice yourself and toast up to see what's good. Consider:


French loaves or baguettes
raisin loaves
challah
nine-grain or multi-grain breads
brown bread

, Because it's difficult to slice bread uniformly, toast is most easily made with pre-sliced bread you can get at the store. Even if you're buying bread at the bakery, you can usually have them machine-slice your loaf before wrapping it up for you.


If you can't get bread that's machine-sliced, slice your own bread using a 'bread' knife. Aim for about 3/4 of an inch thick, slices that will be nice and thick but will also fit in the toast slots.
 If bread becomes too stale to use for sandwiches, don't throw it out. Toast it up! Throwing old bread in the toaster revitalizes it, and might have even been the catalyst for toast in the first place.


Toast was likely invented in ancient Egypt, where pyramid-builders were often paid in bread that would remain left outdoors for long periods of time, becoming stale. To make the bread more palatable, it was livened up a bit over open fires, making the first toasted bread.

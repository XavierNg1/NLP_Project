 Gently wash your herbs using water. Remove any dirt, debris, and/or insects clinging to the plants.If you want less manual labor, you can encourage insects to leave the plants of their own volition by putting the freshly harvested plants in a shady place for a couple hours before cleaning them.
 Use a sharp knife to slice your herbs without bruising them. You’ll want to cut away and separate the parts (such as the roots or stems) that you don’t want to use for your infusion.Cutting herbs into small pieces will increase their surface area, which enhances their absorption in infusions. However, if you plan on storing them for a long time, you may want to keep them in the largest units possible since that will help maintain their potency.
 To optimize their nutrition, dry herbs slowly and out of direct sunlight. Spread them in a single layer on a tray, and let them dry for two days in a dark, dry space, ideally with a temperature around 75 degrees F (24 C).You can also make infusions using fresh herbs, but they generally will not be as potent in taste or nutrition.
 Dried herbs should be kept in airtight containers (like a glass jar with a screw-top lid) in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight. Be sure to clearly label each container with the common and botanical name of the herb as well as the date of purchase or harvest.Storing them correctly will help preserve the potency of your herbs for longer. Well-stored herbs will never “go bad,” but they will greatly diminish in nutrition and flavor, so it’s best not keep them for longer than a year.

 Go through every room in your home and sort items by what you will do with them: keep, donate, or throw away. Keep items should be things you need and cannot part with, throw away items should be those which are completely useless to everyone, and donate items are those which you can’t use but someone else would benefit from.;
, Sometimes we feel like we need something but we really don’t. These are the types of items which usually make homes cluttered and leave little space for the things we do need. Once you’re done with the initial keep-donate-trash sweep, make a second sweep through your keep items and think about the last time you used them and if you actually need them.
 For the items that you will trash or donate, consider the best uses for those items. Certain types of donated items will do the most good if donated to particular organizations (old furniture to Goodwill, toys to the Salvation Army, clothes to refugee organizations, etc). Make sure that items you designate trash really are trash. Tattered clothing should not be donated but low-quality though functional and intact kitchen equipment could really help someone out.

 Just as with any other wart treatment, you will want to soak the thick, hardened skin around the wart in hot water for up to fifteen minutes. Allow the tissue to soften so that it is more readily removed with the pumice stone. Towel dry the wart before using the stone., Use a pumice stone immediately after soaking to gently remove the softened layers of dead skin near the wart. Do not press too hard, as this could cause cracking and infection. Instead, use a gentle back-and-forth motion over the area around the wart, and stop when you notice healthy, live skin., After pumicing, use petroleum jelly or another moisturizing cream to cover the wart overnight and allow it to soften. In the morning, wash off any residual jelly or cream and towel dry the site., There is no medical proof that duct tape is an effective treatment for warts, but many claim to have great success with this home remedy. After pumicing the wart, cover it with a small piece of duct tape. Change out the tape every six or so days to peel away the wart a few layers at a time.Repeat the soaking and pumicing process every time you change out the duct tape.
Continue this process for no more than two months. If the treatment is not working, try another over the counter treatment, or contact your doctor for further care instructions.

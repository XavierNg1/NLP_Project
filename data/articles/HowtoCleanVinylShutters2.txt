 You can purchase a commercial cleaner online or at a local hardware store. Use a professional grade cleaner designed to renew oxidized shutters. Shutter cleaners vary in terms of preparation, but most should be diluted with water prior to use. Read your shutter cleaner's directions carefully before applying it to your shutters and dilute it accordingly., Place your cleaner in a spray bottle or pump garden cleaner. Focusing on two shutters at a time, spritz a layer of cleaner over each shutter. Let the cleaner sit on for five minutes before proceeding.Do not let the solution dry on your shutters. Be very careful to set a timer for five minutes and watch the solution carefully to make sure it is not drying.
 Take a non-scratch scouring pad. Working with one shutter at a time, wipe down each side of the shutters to remove the oxidation. Use scrubbing motions to remove mold, dirt, debris, and other stuck-on residue. If you see mild dirt, like mildew, leave this for now. You can target this later during a routine cleaning., After cleaning your shutters, scratch your shutters gently with your nail. If oxidation has been removed successfully, your nails should leave no visible marks., If your nail left a mark in the shutter, once again wet each shutter with your cleaning solution. Then, scrub down the shutters with a non-scratch scouring pad. From there, apply the nail test again. A second cleaning is usually enough to remove lingering oxidation.If the oxidation remains after two cleanings, consider hiring professionals.
 Never let cleaning solution sit on your shutters. Use a hose or damp towel to wipe or spray down your shutters. Keep wiping or spraying your shutters until no traces of cleaning solution remain and water runs clear.

 One side of the equation should be the exponent, the other should be the whole number. If not, modify the equation so the exponent is alone on one side.

For example, you need to isolate the expression 43+x{\displaystyle 4^{3+x}} in the equation 43+x−8=17{\displaystyle 4^{3+x}-8=17} by adding 8 to both sides:43+x−8=17{\displaystyle 4^{3+x}-8=17}43+x−8+8=17+8{\displaystyle 4^{3+x}-8+8=17+8}43+x=25{\displaystyle 4^{3+x}=25}


, Set up the equation so that you are taking the log of both sides. A log is the inverse of an exponent.. You can find a base-10 log using most scientific calculators. For now, you are just rewriting the equation, indicating you are taking the log of each side.

For example, if you take the base-10 log of both sides of 43+x=25{\displaystyle 4^{3+x}=25}, you would rewrite the equation like this: log43+x=log25{\displaystyle {\text{log}}4^{3+x}={\text{log}}25}.
 Rewrite it using the rule logar=rloga{\displaystyle {\text{log}}a^{r}=r{\text{log}}a}. Rewriting the exponential expression this way will allow you to simplify and solve the equation. Do not calculate the logs yet.

For example, log43+x=log25{\displaystyle {\text{log}}4^{3+x}={\text{log}}25} can be rewritten as (3+x)log4=log25{\displaystyle (3+x){\text{log}}4={\text{log}}25}


, To solve, you need to rewrite the equation so that one side contains the variable, and the other side contains all of the numbers. You will need to divide each side of the equation by the log of the exponential expression. You will also need to add or subtract any constants to both sides, and perform any other necessary operations.

For example, to isolate the x{\displaystyle x} in (3+x)log4=log25{\displaystyle (3+x){\text{log}}4={\text{log}}25}, you first need to divide each side of the equation by log4{\displaystyle {\text{log}}4}, then subtract 3 from both sides:(3+x)log4=log25{\displaystyle (3+x){\text{log}}4={\text{log}}25}(3+x)log4log4=log25log4{\displaystyle (3+x){\frac {{\text{log}}4}{{\text{log}}4}}={\frac {{\text{log}}25}{{\text{log}}4}}}3+x=log25log4{\displaystyle 3+x={\frac {{\text{log}}25}{{\text{log}}4}}}3+x−3=log25log4−3{\displaystyle 3+x-3={\frac {{\text{log}}25}{{\text{log}}4}}-3}x=log25log4−3{\displaystyle x={\frac {{\text{log}}25}{{\text{log}}4}}-3}


, You can do this using a scientific calculator. Type the number you are finding the log of, then hit the LOG{\displaystyle {\text{LOG}}} button. Rewrite the equation using these new values for the logs.

For example, to find log25{\displaystyle {\text{log}}25}, hit 25{\displaystyle 25}, then LOG{\displaystyle {\text{LOG}}} on your calculator, to get about 1.3979. To find log4{\displaystyle {\text{log}}4}, hit 4{\displaystyle 4}, then LOG{\displaystyle {\text{LOG}}} on your calculator, to get about 0.602. You new equation will now be x=1.39790.602−3{\displaystyle x={\frac {1.3979}{0.602}}-3}.
 This will give you the value of the variable. Your answer will be approximate since you rounded when finding the logs. Remember to use the order of operations when making your calculations. For more instructions on how to calculate using the order of operations, read Evaluate an Expression Using PEMDAS.

For example, in x=1.39790.602−3{\displaystyle x={\frac {1.3979}{0.602}}-3} you should divide first, then subtract:x=1.39790.602−3{\displaystyle x={\frac {1.3979}{0.602}}-3}x=2.322−3{\displaystyle x=2.322-3}x=−0.678{\displaystyle x=-0.678}.

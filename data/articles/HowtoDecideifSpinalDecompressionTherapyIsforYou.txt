 Describe them as detailed as possible. When does the back pain occur? When you lift weights, bend forward or is it present all the time? Listen to your doctor’s recommendations. It is important that serious diseases be excluded as a possible cause of your back pain before any form of chiropractic treatment can be started. Back pain may be a sign of rheumatic disease, a result of a physical trauma or a compressive tumor.;
, After you are certain that you don’t have a severe medical problem, you should ask your doctor how to proceed. If your doctor recommends you to take painkillers or suggests surgery, then ask him or her whether you may benefit from alternative therapies, such as chiropractic treatment. It is important to mention that some doctors are hesitant to suggest alternative therapies because they don’t have enough experience with patients who have been cured by chiropractors.
 Although your doctor may not have experience in non-invasive treatment methods, he or she is very useful in excluding potentially dangerous medical disorders through an X-ray, CT, or MRI scan that may reveal any serious abnormality. If no severe abnormality is found, you can safely proceed with chiropractic treatment.
 Make sure to read reviews on the Internet about a particular medical office or doctor before you start the spinal decompression therapy. This alternative, non-aggressive method involves relieving any signs of compression in the spinal vertebrae through careful manipulations of your spine by a qualified physical therapist. Although this therapy requires a decent amount of time to address any spinal issues, it helps you achieve spinal integrity without “aggressive” maneuvers and side effects.
 Don’t wait for miracles - just be patient and maintain consistency, and you will certainly see wonderful results.

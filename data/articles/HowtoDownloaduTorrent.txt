 If you are using Windows, you can click the “Get uTorrent” button in the center of the website. This will open the page where you can choose between the free or the paid version. If you are just planning on using the torrent function, then you don’t have to worry about the paid version.


If you are using Mac OS X, hover your cursor over the “Help” menu and then select “FAQs”. Click the “Is there a Mac or Linux version?” link. Then click the Mac link that appears.;
, Once the download is complete, run the installer to begin installing uTorrent. If you are using Mac OS X, drag the .dmg file into your Applications folder to install it. Most users can use the typical installation settings.


If you don’t want uTorrent to install any toolbars for your browser, make sure to uncheck the boxes allowing toolbars to be installed.
 If you want to get the most connections possible, and therefore the highest possible speed, you will need to forward the uTorrent port on your router.


Once uTorrent is installed, open it and click the Options menu. Select Preferences, and then click the Connection option. Make note of the port listed in the field.
Once you have the port noted, open your router configuration page and enter that port into your Port Forward menu. Follow this guide for more details.
 Click Options and select Preferences if it is not still open. By default the files you download will be placed in the Downloads folder in your Library. If you want to change this location, click the Directories option. Check the “Put new downloads in” box and then browse to the directory that you want to store your download files in.
 Now that your basic preferences are set, you can start downloading and seeding torrents. Torrent files survive thanks to the community, so keep seeding completed files as long as possible.

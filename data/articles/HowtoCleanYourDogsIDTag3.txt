Be sure to remove all oil, grime, and fingerprints from the surface. Continue wiping until all the lettering on the tag is clearly visible.For a more thorough cleaning, soak the tag in a cup of rubbing alcohol for 5-10 minutes.
 Pat the tag dry with a paper towel. If desired, leave the tag to air dry for several minutes. Repeat this process once a week or whenever the tag looks dirty.

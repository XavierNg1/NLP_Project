 To set the time and date of your analog expedition watch you will first need to locate the crown. The crown will appear as a small circular disc on the edge of your watch. You will be pulling this disc out and away from the body of the watch to set both the time and date.


Pulling the crown all the way out will allow you to adjust the time.
Pulling the crown half way out to the middle position will allow you to adjust the date.
Pushing the crown back in will restart the watch, starting from the time and date you have set it to.
 Once you've located the crown you can use it to adjust the time. Using the crown to adjust the time is a simple process that involves pulling it out fully and twisting it until the hands of the watch are at the right time. Follow these steps to set your watch using the crown:


Pull the crown out to its outer position, pulling as far as it will extend.
Once extended you can twist the crown to adjust where the arms of the watch are positioned.
Twist the crown until the arms are set to the right time.
Push the crown back down into the watch to start it up once again.
 To set the date and day on your watch you will need to first find the crown. The crown will need to be pulled out and away from the watch and then twisted until the correct date is shown. Follow these few steps to use the crown when setting the date:


Find the crown and pull it out of the watch to the middle position. This will be half of its length.
Turn the crown clockwise until you see the correct date.
If the date isn't changing, pull the crown to the outer position and turn ahead by 24 hours.
Put the crown back into its neutral position, fully pressed down into the watch.

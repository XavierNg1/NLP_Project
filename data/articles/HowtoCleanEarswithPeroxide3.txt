 Hydrogen peroxide may be too harsh for you if you have sensitive skin. Peroxide can be very drying, which can be irritating if you’re prone to breakouts or skin reactions. If peroxide is drying your ear canals, try adding a few drops of mineral or baby oil to the peroxide.If that doesn’t help, use an alternate method to clean your ears.


You can try warm water alone or a saline solution, instead. Make a saline solution by dissolving ½ teaspoon of salt in a cup of boiled water., If you have an ear infection, don’t try to clean your ears with peroxide. See your doctor to get diagnosed and treated — you might need antibiotics, depending on what’s causing your infection.You may have an ear infection if you have ear pain (especially when you lie down), diminished hearing, and fluid draining from your ear. You may also have a feeling of fullness or pressure in your ear, or a fever.Look for signs of a possible ear infection in children, such as crying and pulling at their ear, trouble sleeping, difficulty hearing and responding to sounds, fever of 100°F (38°C) or higher, loss of balance, not eating, or complaining of a headache., If your eardrum perforates, or ruptures, don’t put anything liquid in your ear. Suspect that your eardrum has ruptured if you have increasing pain or pressure in your ear, followed by quick relief from pain, drainage from your ear, and loss of hearing.

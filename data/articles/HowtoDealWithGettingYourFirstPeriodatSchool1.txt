 Perhaps you were prepared and have a pad stashed in your locker, but maybe this isn’t the case for you. Not to worry! Simply ask any girl in school who you think might have their period. No need to be embarrassed! Women sharing feminine hygiene products is a practice as old as time! It is part of the code of being a girl.Your bathrooms at school may have a coin-operated dispenser that sells pads.
You can also visit your school nurse. There will certainly be pads available there.;
, Sit down on the toilet so any blood will drip into the toilet bowl and not onto the floor or your clothing. Clean up your body using some toilet paper.
 Carefully open the packaging around your pad and remove it. You may want to save the wrapper for later. It is perfect for disposing of your pad when it’s time to change.Then, remove the backing to expose the adhesive. Usually, you will find a long piece of wax-like paper covering the sticky-side on the bottom of the pad. (In some brands, the outer wrapper may also double as backing, so the adhesive may already be exposed)., On most underwear, there is a cotton strip that you can use as a guide. Basically, you want the pad to cover the part that goes between your legs. If your pad has one wider or bigger side, it should go toward the back of your underwear (toward your butt). Make sure the adhesive is stuck firmly to the fabric of your underwear.If your pad has wings, remove the backing and fold them around the middle part of your underwear, so it looks like the pad is hugging your underwear — its "arms" wrapped around the crotch of the underwear.Make sure the pad isn't too far forward or too far back. It should be centered.
 Make sure that your underwear and the pad fit snugly against your body. It might be a little uncomfortable at first (reminiscent of a diaper), but you will get used to it. You should change your pad every three to four hours (or sooner if you have a really heavy flow).

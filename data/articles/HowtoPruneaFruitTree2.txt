 Cut above an outward facing bud at a 30-degree angle. This will encourage the branch to grow up and out in a direction that will give your tree a red wine glass-like shape. If you cut above an inward-facing bud, the branch will grow incorrectly inward toward the tree, which you don't want to happen., A thinning cut is used to thin out the tree branches and allow more sunlight to reach the limbs. Perform a thinning cut by clipping a branch as close to the collar of the tree as possible, taking care not to leave an exposed node.Perform thinning cuts on branches that are at least 50% smaller than the diameter of their parent branch., A bench cut is used to thin out the center of the tree and get rid of strong upright shoots and branches. To perform a bench cut, identify horizontal branches, then cut the branches and shoots coming out of their top side (especially those close to the trunk).

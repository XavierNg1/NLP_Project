 If you prefer, you can use pulp-free orange juice, or orange juice with pulp for additional thickness. Orange juice will add a little bit of tartness to your smoothie, contrasting well with the sweetness of the strawberries and blackberries.
 You can use fresh or frozen strawberries and blackberries. If you are using fresh fruit, be sure to wash it and remove the crown (the green leafy stem at the top) of the strawberries before adding to your mixture.
 Adding the hard ice after the fruit will allow the blender blades to grind more effectively.


If using frozen fruit, you may prefer to reduce the amount of ice to 1/2 cup. If the strawberries and blackberries are frozen, they will help make your smoothie cold and icy.
 Plain yogurt will impart a tarter flavor and add an additional creaminess to your smoothie.
 Repeat until mixed. You may need to stir your smoothie with a spoon between mixes to ensure that no strawberries, blackberries, or ice cubes get stuck.


Listen to the sound of the blender. If the blender is making a lot of noise, keep blending until the sound is smooth. Stir one last time with a spoon to ensure that your smoothie is completely blended.
If your smoothie is still very slushy when you have finished blending, add additional cubes of ice until your smoothie reaches your desired consistency.
 Pour your smoothie into a chilled glass or cups to share. Top your smoothie off with a straw.

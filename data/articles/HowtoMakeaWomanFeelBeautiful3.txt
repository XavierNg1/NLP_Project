 Female insecurity is a common problem for a reason. Statistically, being conventionally attractive is advantageous to one's career and personal life. Women, even very conventionally attractive women, often feel insecure about their looks and tend to feel threatened by beautiful women. Try to be understanding of this and provide emotional support through listening. Understand women do not actively try to be insecure but there is a lot of societal pressure to fit a certain standard of beauty., One of the best thing you can do to help a woman feel beautiful is to talk to her. Allow her to openly communicate her insecurities to you.


Listen when your wife, girlfriend, or female friend expresses negative thoughts about her appearance. Practice active listening by summarizing what is said after she finishes talking and give verbal cues, like nodding, to show you're paying attention.While you can provide reassurance, understand you cannot fix someone else's insecurity. If you're concerned that your wife, girlfriend, or female friend is overly concerned with her appearance, gently suggest she talk her concerns over with a counselor or therapist., Women like to feel beautiful for their minds as well as their bodies. By encouraging her passions, you make a woman feel beautiful.


Encourage her to pursue her interests. If she's interested in singing, ask her to sing for you. If she's an avid painter, ask to take a look at her work.Ask her about what's important to her. Ask her about her work, school, hobbies, and interests. Showing a vested interest in a woman's personality, as well as her exterior qualities, can help her feel beautiful.

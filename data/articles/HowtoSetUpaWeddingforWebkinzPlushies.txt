 Make a white dress and a suit for the plushies getting married. Or, you can buy some at your local Webkinz dealer.;
, Choose the part of your room where the wedding will take place. Hang pretty items that you might see at a wedding, such as artificial flowers, ribbon bows and bouquets. Roll out a little fabric carpet for the plushies to walk down the aisle on.


Decorate with homemade Webkinz crafts.
Blow up white balloons. Take photos of the couple, print these off and stick gently to the balloons. Hang in place.
 This should be at the end of the "aisle" you've created.
 This is where the plushies will celebrate the wedding after.


Color a large piece of cardboard to serve as the dance floor.
Make a cake and maybe even some cookies. Make these real, so that you and your friends can actually enjoy them.
Include some beverages too.



Choose a plushie who will be the officiant or priest at the wedding.
 Or, you can just sing for them.
 If you want to, send them invitations or e-invites to come to the Webkinz wedding! It's always more fun with a friend.
 Place these seated in front of the altar area but not on the aisle. They're an important part of the plushie ceremony.

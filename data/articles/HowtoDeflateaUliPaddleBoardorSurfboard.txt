, The valve is a "push-push" valve, so push on it to open it. The red pin is higher when the valve is closed and lower when the valve is open and ready to deflate. You will immediately hear a rush of air flowing out of the board.
 Always roll the Uli with the fins inside and the deck pad on the outside. Start rolling with fins up and deck down. Roll in the direction starting at the tail and move to the nose.
 Push close the valve to prevent the board from re-inflating.

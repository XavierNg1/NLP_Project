 It might sound funny, but a cheap plastic colander/strainer can work wonders as a litter box for a rabbit. What you want is one of the cheap plastic supermarket varieties, which come in two pieces: the top portion is the filter/colander (with holes in it), and the bottom part is the bowl to catch the water.This will make a perfect dry litter box.


Be careful with the size of the bowl you are buying; if it's too small your rabbit will end up shooting the litter outside of the littler box and if its too big it will be hard for them to claim in.;
,, You might end up wanting to try a few different brands of rabbit and cat litter. Consider one with a scent to reduce the odor.
,, Place a piece of tissue which you have used to wipe your rabbit's mess in the littler box, and place the littler box just next to the cage entrance. By doing this so, your rabbit will have to get in and out of the litter box every time he get out of the cage and vice versa.


He will definitely explore the litter box, and thanks to the rabbit's nature, once he identified his own smell from the tissue, he'll know what the purpose is. Slowly he will find it comfortable to throw his mess there than anywhere else and it will become his permanent littering location.
Once your rabbit learned to use the litter box frequently,you can move the litter box further away,but not too far from the previous location.Increase the distance slowly everyday and after a month or so you can place the litter box anywhere but make sure that your rabbit has easy access to it.
 You will find it very easy and convenient to clean the litter box.

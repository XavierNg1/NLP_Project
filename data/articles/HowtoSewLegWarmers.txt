, Measure you leg's circumference at the thickest part and add a little extra to the material. For example, if your circumference is about 40 centimeter (15.7 in), for each warmer you want to cut two pieces of 25x50cm- you want them a bit loose, don't we? Then cut two pieces, 50x50cm each.
 Fold the pieces from the middle and cut. Done? Great! Now, you should have four pieces of 25x50cm. Now cut 10 centimeter (3.9 in) off, resulting in four 25x40cm and 25x10cm pieces.
 Sew the 25x40cm pieces together from the long edges. Be sure to use the zig-zag!

, Sew them together from the narrow edges, creating two 50x10cm loops.
 Fold each of the loops in half along the long sides, seams inwards, forming a tunnel. Sew the loop on the main piece- notice to keep this piece's seam inwards as you sew! Check it twice, so you don't make any mistakes.
 Use a needle to mark the proper size, then sew and cut it like pictured. This way you won't need an elastic band on top- looks way more professional!

, Put the elastic band in with a safety-pinny and sew to proper length.
 Remove all strands. If you want them to be extra fancy (or cover up a mistake, whoopie doopie), add a tag! Few people put tags to their crafts, so this will look extra cool!

, Now go rock that dance class!

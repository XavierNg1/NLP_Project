 Keep the baby’s tummy full during the day. Babies often get distracted by play that they forget they’re hungry. When nighttime comes, they realize they are hungry and need to eat more frequently throughout the night. Give the baby full feedings throughout the day so her tummy will remain full at night. , Babies should start having a regular nap schedule starting around 2-4 months of age. Babies take at least 2-3 naps per day, depending on age. A baby will not sleep better if he/she skips a nap during the day. Instead, he/she will sleep worse because the brain will release cortisol, a hormone that responds to stress. This will make him/her sleep more fitfully. Make a consistent nap routine to ensure that sleep comes more easily at night.
 Promote good sleep habits by doing noisy activities during the day and quiet activities at night. Your baby will be stimulated during the day, but will learn to calm down at night. He/she won’t expect to play and be entertained at night.
 Try laying down the baby when he's/she’s drowsy but not fully asleep. He/she will start learning how to fall asleep on his/her own instead of relying on you to help him/her.

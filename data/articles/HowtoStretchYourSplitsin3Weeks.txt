 This will take quite some time, so find a few weeks where you'll have some free time.


Start week 1. Stretch for fifteen minutes each day. Some helpful stretches are listed on the site below. Do this everyday of week 1.
Start week 2. Same as week 1, but stretch an additional 15 minutes each day. Do two stretching sessions (like 15 minutes in the morning, 15 minutes in the evening).
Start week 3. Same as week 2, with an additional 15-minute session. It helps to stretch 15 minutes in the morning, 15 in the afternoon, and 15 in the evening.

 If she is in a relationship, she may be uninterested in you or unable to express her feelings about you. Either way, you'll likely wind up being disappointed.


Her mentioning her significant other should be a good sign that she is not interested in a relationship with you., If you find yourself having romantic feelings for someone from a vastly different social circle, you may run into problems. This is especially true if the girl in question is considered dramatically cooler or hipper.


If you are in a different social circle, you may have trouble getting one-on-one contact time. As a result, you may be unable to communicate that you'd like a romantic relationship.
Consult your friends as to whether the girl in question is "out of your league." Think seriously about your feelings if they tell you that the girl is too cool or too attractive for you.
It is okay to try to pursue someone from outside your social circle. Just make sure you are open to unspoken cues she might send that suggest she is not interested in you. In addition, if she explicitly tells you that she is uninterested, you should back off., You might find yourself having feelings for someone who for some reason isn't interested in getting into a relationship. If she's avoiding relationships for the time being, you may need to back off for now, but not necessarily for forever. Reflect on whether:


She recently got out of a relationship that left her hurt or sad.
She is focused on academics or her career.
She has a lot going on in her life which leaves little time for romantic relationships.

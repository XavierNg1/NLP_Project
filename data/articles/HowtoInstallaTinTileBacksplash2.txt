 The material that your tin backsplash will lay on will help you determine what kind of adhesive to use. For instance, if applying it to drywall, using silicone adhesive is a great option.If you are applying it to tile, however, a resin based ceramic tile adhesive like epoxy may work best.Other options include superglue and double-sided adhesive tape.
Purchase adhesive at a hardware store or online.
 Apply the adhesive evenly across the back of the tiles that you want to place against the wall. Use a back and forth pattern. If you're using embossed tiles, make sure to spread enough adhesive to fill in the back of the tin, because tin tends to dent.If you are using adhesive tape, put a continuous strip on the top and bottom of your tin tiles., Once you've put the tin tile against the wall, press hard with both of your palms. Rub the surface of the tile with your hands and make sure that it's laying evenly on the wall.Make adjustments to your tile before the glue dries.
Using a level will also give you an additional level of precision when working with the tile.
 Use a nail gun or a hammer with nails and nail the backdrop into your wall or plywood.Use nails that match the color of your tin backdrop so that they blend in and aren't obvious. Put a nail in each corner of your backdrop. If you want to add extra stability, you can add extra nails in between your four nails on each side of the backdrop.


Make sure that the nail is flush with your tin backdrop, so it doesn't get snagged on someone's clothes.
 Let the glue dry completely before running a shower or touching it. It's important to tell people not to lean or touch the tiles while it sets. If you notice something is wrong with the tiles, make sure to adjust it before the glue begins to dry.

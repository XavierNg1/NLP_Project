 Injection rhinoplasty, sometimes referred to as the five minute or fifteen-minute nose job, is a non-surgical procedure some people may be able to use to create a straighter nose for a period of six to twelve months.Injection rhinoplasty is best for people with mild humps, deviations or irregularities that they wish to correct without undergoing an actual rhinoplasty procedure.
Injection rhinoplasty is not a viable option for those with a more pronounced bend in their nose.;
, Not all plastic surgeons conduct injection rhinoplasties, so you may need to do some internet research to find one near you that suits your needs.


You can find a list of board certified plastic surgeons in your area on PlasticSurgery.org.
Consider seeing more than one surgeon if you would like multiple opinions on the options you have for your nose.
 The plastic surgeon will inject dermal filler into specific areas of your nose in order to alter the shape of it and create a straighter overall appearance.Once the injections have been made, the doctor will massage the material into exactly the right shape to fit your nose.
You are completely awake during the procedure and can oversee each action the doctor makes.
 After your nose heals, the changes made to its appearance will last for six to twelve months, at which point you may choose to undergo the procedure once again.Do not touch your nose for a few days immediately after the procedure as the dermal filling sets and the injection sites heal.
Because the results are temporary, adjustments can be made throughout your treatment to achieve a lasting, natural looking nose.

 This technique is so important, but many people forget about it when speaking to people. It shows attentiveness and interest in what's being said. Increased eye contact is associated with credibility and dominance, so it is important to maintain solid eye contact when speaking to someone.
 Something as simple as a smile can completely change the way a conversation goes. Smiling helps us form and sustain interpersonal relationships, so it is an essential part of communicating with others.
 Your body language should be relaxed. This means that you should not cross your arms or stiffen your body. Keeping your arms open invites reciprocated communication rather than sending a message of being closed and unreceptive.
 Your tone of voice can be an immediate deciding factor for how someone interprets what you say. You could say a phrase in a positive tone and someone would interpret it positively, while saying the same thing in a harsh tone would lead to a negative interpretation.
 Verbal communication is different than other forms of communication in that it is easier to get off topic, which can make it hard to remember what the conversation was really supposed to be about. This is confusing for your listener. So, stay on topic.
 Before you start talking, you should be confident that you can achieve the goal you have for engaging in this conversation. If you are unsure of yourself, your conversation partner will be less receptive to your message.

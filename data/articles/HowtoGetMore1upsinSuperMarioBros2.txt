 Koopa Troopas are the green or red turtles. As you progress through the game, you’ll often encounter them. If you jump on a Koopa, you’ll only make them hide in their shell. They’ll eventually emerge if you leave them alone. You can only kill Koopas by having them shell-dash off a cliff (or if they walk off a cliff on their own) or by throwing fireballs at them.
 Once you find a Koopa on a flight of stairs, jump (A, 2) on it once to have it hide in its shell. Make sure that it stays on one of the steps on the stairs.
 Once it’s hidden, continue jumping on the Koopa. It’ll stay on the step as it won’t be able to move around, not with the next step going up hindering its movement to the right and Mario jumping on it from the left.


You’ll first earn points as you jump on the Koopa, but if you continue jumping on it, it’ll eventually give you 1ups. Keep doing this for all Koopas you find on stairs to get unlimited 1ups.

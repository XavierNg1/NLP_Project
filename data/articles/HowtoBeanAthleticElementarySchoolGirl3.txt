  It's understandable that you're afraid of the basketball that gave you a bleeding nose last year, but you must understand that sports aren't meant to scare you or make you get hurt, it's just a disadvantage that comes with playing it.  Sure you may get a few bruises, but you will heal.  Try your best and move it!

,  When you see a ball coming your way, unless it's dodgeball and you don't think you can catch the ball, put your hands out and focus your eyes on the ball. Once it's in your hands, don't hold that position.  Clasp the ball in your hands tightly.  This will take practice.  To throw a ball, grab it firmly with your fingers on one or both hands, but your arm(s) back like a slingshot, and throw all your strength to the front of you and let go of the ball.  Tada!  You are now a master.
  You have to master or be extremely good at one sport to be called "athletic".  It does not have to be a team sport if you are not rather competitive.  Biking is a sport, rock climbing is a sport.  Practice that sport almost everyday or everyday if you have the time to spare.  Practice makes perfect, so fight!

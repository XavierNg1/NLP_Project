 Look for the Bubble Witch Saga 2 app on your mobile device. It’s the one with the app icon of a witch and some colored bubbles. Tap on the icon to launch the app.
 On the lower left corner of the screen is a circle icon with three horizontal lines. Tap on the icon to bring up the game’s settings.
 Under the Settings menu, there are some options. The first one from the top left is for Sound. Tap on this icon to mute the sounds of the game. The icon will then display a red slash to signify that the game has been muted, and you won’t hear any more sounds during your gameplay.
 If you don’t want to hear the Bubble Witch Saga 2 theme music running in the background, tap on the second option, and the theme song will cease to play. The icon should now display a red slash to signify that the game is muted.

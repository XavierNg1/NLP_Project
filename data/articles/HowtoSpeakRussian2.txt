 One of the best ways to improve your new language skills is to practice speaking with a native speaker. They will easily be able to correct any grammar or pronunciation mistakes you make and can introduce you to more informal or colloquial forms of speech that you won't find in a textbook.


If you have a Russian speaking friend who is willing to help, that's great! Otherwise, you can place an ad in the local paper or online or investigate whether there are any pre-existing Russian conversation groups in the area.
If you can't locate any Russian-speakers nearby, try finding someone on Skype. They might be willing to exchange 15 minutes of Russian conversation for 15 minutes of English.
 If you need some extra motivation or feel you would learn better in a more formal setting, try signing up for a Russian language course.


Look out for language courses advertised at local colleges, schools or community centers.
If you're nervous about signing up for a class by yourself, drag a friend along. You'll have more fun and also someone to practice with between classes!

, Get your hands on some Russian DVDs (with subtitles) or watch Russian cartoons online. This is an easy, entertaining way to get a feel for the sound and structure of the Russian language.
 Once you feel comfortable with the basics of Russian speech, consider taking a trip to Russia. What better way to immerse yourself in the Russian language than a journey to the motherland!

, Good luck!

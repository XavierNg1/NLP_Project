 You can recycle if you have a broken one, or go to the junkyard and look; all you need is the upper part of the lamp, or the shade frame.;
, Remove all fabrics, screws, and other unwanted parts; you are just going to need the frame.
 Grab a 100 grit sandpaper and scrape off any rusty parts.
, This will serve as the base and is where you will mount your lighting kit.
 Drill a hole on each end. This will be your bracket that will attach the base to the frame of the lamp.


Screw the base to the frame of the lamp using the bracket.






Make sure the base is secured to the frame.
 You can get these pre-assembled from a hardware store.
, They should be roughly the same length and size as one another, and long enough to span from the top to the bottom of the lamp frame.
 Roll the twine around the base until you are happy with the look.


This adds a decorative touch and will also help as you place and attach the twigs to the frame.
 You can trim them if you want to, depending on your preference.



You just need to hold the twigs in place; you will be removing these wires after you have secured the twigs to the frame of the lamp.
, This should match the twine you wrapped around the base, and it will help hold the twigs in place.
 At this point your lamp is almost complete. Add more twigs if you think they're needed as the look comes together.
, You can use plain white paper or tracing paper.


Roll and insert your diffuser in the center of your lampshade. Get a 15-20 watt bulb and screw it in on the light socket.
 Since your lampshade has a dimmer switch, adjust the lighting to your preference.

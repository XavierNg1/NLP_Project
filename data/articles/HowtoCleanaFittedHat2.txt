 Once you’ve rinsed all the soap off your hat, pat it dry with a towel or paper towel to remove most of the excess moisture. You don’t need to completely dry it, but it shouldn’t be dripping wet., Laying a fitted hat to dry will ruin its shape. Instead of letting it lie flat on a counter or table, place it on top of a canister, or place some balled-up paper towel inside the hat. This will help it keep its shape as it dries.You can also purchase a Cap Buddy, which is a plastic frame that you place your hat inside of. The frame is the same shape as the cap and maintains that shape even as it dries.
 Once you’ve removed most of the excess moisture from the hat, let it dry the rest of the way in open air. This can take between a few hours and a whole day, so make sure you have plenty of time to let your hat dry.You can also wear your hat while it dries, as long as it's not dripping and the feeling of a wet hat on your head doesn't bother you.

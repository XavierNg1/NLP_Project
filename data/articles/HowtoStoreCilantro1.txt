 Use a sharp pair of kitchen scissors to trim no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the bottom stem of each sprig of cilantro.


By trimming off the bottom of each stem, you are exposing the fresh, “live” portion of the herb still capable of taking in water. After a stem end is exposed to the air for an hour or so, it will die, making the plant's ability to take in water severely limited.
If you do not have kitchen scissors, you could also trim the stem using a sharp knife.;
, Do not rinse the cilantro at this point. The leaves should not get wet.


If there is dirt or debris needing to be rinsed off, you should wait until just before you are ready to use the cilantro. Rinse the cilantro after you store it, not beforehand.



The water level should only be high enough to cover the stems. Do not make the water so high that the leaves are submerged.






In essence, you are treating the cut cilantro like you would treat cut flowers. The cilantro will absorb the water through its stems as a vase of flowers would do. As a result, the leaves if the cilantro will stay fresh and vibrant for a longer period of time.
 Place a clean plastic baggie over the jar, covering the leaves and the mouth of the jar.


If desired, you could secure the bag in place by wrapping a rubber band over the bottom. This is not essential, though, and there is some question as to whether or not it even helps.






By placing a bag over the cilantro, you limit the amount of harsh air exposure it receives.
 Store the cilantro in your refrigerator until the leaves start to wither or discolor.


The cilantro will usually stay fresh and vibrant for two weeks, if not longer.
 Once the water starts to discolor, you should dump it and refill the jar with clean, fresh water.


You will likely need to change the water every few days.

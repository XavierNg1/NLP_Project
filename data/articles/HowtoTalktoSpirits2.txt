 A dowsing crystal is a crystal that’s hanging on the end of a string or chain. You should feel a sense of attachment to the crystal when you hold it.This indicates that your energy is in tune with the crystal. To find a good dowsing crystal:


Visit a specialty herb shop and pick out a crystal. Hold each one to find one that “speaks” to you.
Use a crystal necklace that was owned by a deceased loved one.
Tie a piece of string around a crystal that you have owned for years.
 Hold the end of the chain in your dominant hand.Next, dangle the crystal over a hard surface, such as a table or the floor. The crystal should be near the surface, but not touching it.


Some people prefer to dangle the crystal over a circle drawn on a piece of paper. This can help you track the movements of the crystal.
 Gently swing the crystal once or twice. Holding your hand steady, ask the spirits to show you a “yes” answer. Make a note of the pattern that the crystal follows. Once the crystal is still, repeat the process, asking for a “no” answer.This pattern may change from session to session.
 Ask yes or no questions and take note of the answers. For example, if you’re trying to contact a particular spirit, you might ask: “Is your name Sandra Burdoch?” The spirit will then direct the crystal in a yes or no formation.


Take any messages received with a grain of salt. Some spirits may try to trick you or they may even be confused.Be polite when talking with spirits and treat them with respect.
 Thank the spirit for speaking with you. Politely ask them to return to the spirit world.Next, set the crystal down. Center yourself in the present by eating some food or having a cup of tea.


If you feel a presence lingering after you’ve ended the session, burn some sage incense to cleanse the room.

 Our first goal is to determine why this child is demonstrating the behavior, and we need to collect data to find out.;
, To do this, collect anecdotal notes and A-B-C- Data. A = Antecedent (what was happening before/when the behavior occurred?) B = Behavior (what was the behavior?), and C = Consequence (what happened as a result of the behavior?)


You can create your own ABC form by folding a sheet of paper into three columns.
 Keep in mine time of day, subject or class, nearby people, or other common patterns.
 Keep track of frequency (how many times behavior occurred) and duration (how long the behavior lasted).

 Toothpaste contains microscopic abrasive particles that can polish and grind down the exterior layers.
 Again, do not use any fabrics that are coarse or abrasive on their own; they will leave additional scratches in the lens.
 Do not use circular motions as they can create circular scuff marks.


The abrasives in toothpaste are harsher than microfiber cloth alone. Concentrating on a single area for too long could penetrate the exterior layers and damage the interior lens.
 You can use warm water or glass cleaners, or a combination of the two.
 Remove any remaining smudge marks from fingers or traces of residue from the toothpaste.

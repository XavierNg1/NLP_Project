 Look for a place with good ventilation where burns and spills won't matter.;
, An old baking pan works well for this purpose. If you're making more than 1 soft plastic lure, you can arrange several molds on the pan.
 This will make it easier to remove the soft plastic lure from the mold after it cools and solidifies.
 If you fill the cup fuller than this, you may have difficulty pouring the resin into the mold once it's heated.


If you're melting down old soft plastic lures, put them in the cup in place of the resin.
 As the resin heats, it will first thicken and then thin, changing from a milky white to clear. Stop heating at once if you see smoke.
, Add the color drop by drop until you have the shade you want. Stir the resin slowly as you add color.
 Use only non-metal glitter to avoid starting a fire in the microwave. As with color, add scents and flavorings gradually in small amounts.
, This will prevent bubbles from forming.


It may take several tries before you learn to fill the mold to the right level.
,, Be sure to lay the molded plastic out flat, as it will set in the position in which you lay it out.


If the lure does set in a crooked position, you can melt it down and re-pour it.
, You can do this with a craft knife, scissors, or a pizza cutter.


As you trim the excess, gather it together. You can melt it down and add it to your next soft plastic lure, or you can add the shavings at the very end to add highlights to lures of a contrasting color.

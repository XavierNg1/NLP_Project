 If you’ve never been to your friend’s house, let them give you a tour to get you familiar with the layout of their house. It’s always interesting to see the ways that people’s houses are different than your own! Even if you’ve been to their house a million times, it can still be fun to have a look around.
 One big draw of going over to a friend’s house is being able to spend time with their pets! If your friend has pets, go over and say hi if they’re friendly. See if they are in the mood to play or take a walk. Make sure that your friend is with you, since your friend knows the pet best.Don’t force their pet to play with you. If their pet is sleeping, leave them be. They may wake up later and be in the mood to play!

, If you run into your friend’s parents, say hi and chat a little with them. Sometimes it’s easier to get along with other people’s parents than your own! Being on good terms with your friend’s parents is also a good way to feel more comfortable and welcome in your friend’s house.Don’t forget to thank your friend’s parents for having you over!

, One great thing about going over to a friend’s house is raiding their pantry! Make sure that it’s ok with your friends and your friends parents, and then treat yourself to a snack that your own parents don’t have around the house. Just make sure to only take one or two snacks so you don’t take advantage of their hospitality!

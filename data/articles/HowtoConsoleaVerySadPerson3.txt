 Help your friend find healthy coping resources. Coping skills are ways to deal with negative feelings and situations. This way, she can express herself or heal without causing herself more harm.Some examples of positive ways of coping with sadness include: spiritual or religious activities, creative exercises (art), nature-related activities, exercise, and mindfulness or meditation.
Avoid drinking alcohol or using substances to excess with your friend or family member.This can be harmful and does not promote healthy coping or a reduction in sadness. In order to discourage using drugs or alcohol to cope you can educate your friend and offer alternatives by saying, "I've read that coping by using alcohol can create more problems and decrease your ability to deal with your emotions and the situation. What if we watch a funny movie together instead?"

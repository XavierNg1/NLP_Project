 Cover the cookie tray/sheet in foil for baking. Smooth butter over the foil, using the back of a tablespoon.;
, Beat until smooth.
 Stir in.
 Mix in until the batter is thoroughly smooth.
 Stir until evenly distributed.
 Beat until the batter is lump-free. The mixture should now be sticky.
 Do not worry about the batter oozing over the tray/sheet. The butter will prevent the batter from sticking to the tray.


Arrange the dough into a cookie shape on your tray/sheet during cooking.
, Despite there being only one pancake cookie in the oven, there will be lines showing where the batter has mixed together. Use a kitchen knife to cut the these lines, creating a rough shape of a round pancake/cookie. Transfer to a wire cooling rack to cool.
 Once cooled down, the chocolate chip pancake cookies are ready to serve. They will have hardened nicely.

 The portal is a large rectangular "doorway" full of green swirling energy. Surrounding the portal is a group of tent-like shelters with Non-Player Characters both Horde and Alliance, all of which are friendly.
, You are now in Outland in the starting zone for both Alliance and Horde players. In front of you, there is a raging battle between Non-Player Characters and Hellfire monsters. Don't try to help because it's very easy to die and the battle will continue to rage. To your left and right, there are more NPCs. On your right, there is a flight master that will allow you to fly away so you won't have to walk to your faction's base through the battle(Thrallmar for the Horde and Honor Hold for the Alliance) in Hellfire Peninsula.

 On the first day of Maslenitsa, Russians usually eat their first (of many) blini at 5pm on Monday, with festivities continuing late into the evening. Russians feast on traditional round and golden pancakes made up of rich foods still allowed by the Orthodox tradition, mainly butter, eggs and milk.;
, The second day of Maslenitsa is for young people. Russians, young and old, traditionally take part in snow sledding or go for winter walks.
 Day three is the ‘sweet day’ of Maslenitsa, where restaurants and cafes in Russia’s major cities offer special menus with a huge variety of blini to try.
 On the fourth day ice skating and feasting are common, as the Great Lent fast approaches. Gorky Park skating rink in particular comes alive with Russians celebrating Maslenitsa.
 Traditionally day 5 is for mothers and especially mothers-in-laws. Families often stroll through parks across Russia to spend time together.
 When the weekend comes, the Maslenitsa celebrations are even grander. As it’s nearly the end of winter, day 6 is a good time to make the most of Russia’s winter sports activities.
 Sunday is the final day, day of forgiving - when people forgive the wrongs done against them and burn the Maslenitsa mascot, a straw doll dressed in a female costume with a pancake in her hand. This practice has become an almost iconic symbol of the festival of Maslenitsa, and the imminent end of winter.

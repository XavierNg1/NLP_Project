 The colors look different on the computer monitor, but when you print them, they will look very much the same as mixed paint colors. This is because your printer is using magenta, yellow, and cyan inks, which are pigments just like paint.
 Red and blue both at 100% make magenta. Blue and green make cyan. Red and Green make yellow. All three at 100% make white, and all three at 0% make black. This can be challenging at first, but you'll soon get the hang of it.

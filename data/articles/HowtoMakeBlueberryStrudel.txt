 You need about four and half cups per serving (about 6 strudels) so go to a blueberry farm and pick the ripest, juiciest ones you can find. It might be easier to pick up a box at the local supermarket.;
, Adjust the heat to medium. Carefully remove the pan from heat and stir in lemon juice. Let the filling cool for about 10 minutes. Then, pour into two cups.
 Keep the other 12 stacked, and then cut them in halves. Cover the dough with wrap and a damp washcloth (this will prevent it from drying out.) Crumble the 3 dried sheets of dough and place into a bowl.
 Slather a sheet with butter, and then place it somewhere where it will not get in the way. Brush butter on a sheet of phyllo. Continue doing so until you have about 4 layers. Sprinkle two teaspoons of the dried phyllo and top with the filling. Roll dough until you have a strudel size appropriate for you. (Usually, it will be about 41/2 by 21/2 inches.)

, Make sure all strudels are filled before placing in the oven. Cook for 15-20 minutes until crisp. Set them on a cooling rack and let them cool for ten minutes.
 If you want to save the strudels, place them in Ziploc bags and place in the fridge. When desired, take them out and microwave for desired time. They will taste just as good.

 The most important part of kayaking straight is to always face forwards. Face your shoulders in the direction you are wanting to go, and keep your head facing in the same direction.
 Watching the paddles tends to cause you to turn your kayak, resulting in slowing down., If you're struggling with going straight, add a sweep stroke on the side you are turning towards in order to straighten up., Going straight will ensure you travel much faster than if you are curving.

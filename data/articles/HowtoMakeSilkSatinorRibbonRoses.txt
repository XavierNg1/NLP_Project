, If it is shorter, it is harder to work with, and if it is longer, there will be far more ribbon than is required for a rose. Note that since you will cut the ribbon again when the rose is complete, you can skip this step to avoid wasting lengths of ribbon.
, The other strand of ribbon will now be on the bottom.
 Alternate folds until the stack is of considerable thickness or you’ve almost run out of ribbon.
 Don't worry about letting go of the stack of squares; because they’re folded together, they will simply stretch out into an accordion.
 Be sure to keep the other end stationary as you pull. This will bunch the folds of the accordion more closely together, making a little knot of petals. Pull until the rose is the size and shape you desire, but note that if you pull too far, the folds will pop right out and the rose will be undone.
 It might help to flip the rose over and press the ribbon down with one finger while you tie the knot. Again, do not pull the strands too hard or you will undo the petal folds.

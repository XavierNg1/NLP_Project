 Ultraviolet B (UVB) light is found in sunlight and has been known to improve psoriasis symptoms. Phototherapy treatments are often done under medical supervision in an office, but careful exposure to sunlight can have similar effects.


It is best to consult your doctor before beginning a sunbathing regimen. Exposure to sunlight can aggravate your psoriasis.
 Make sure areas unaffected by your psoriasis are covered with sunblock before exposing your skin to sunlight. This will protect you from painful sunburns and skin cancer. Use at least SPF 30 to ensure proper protection.
 At first, only expose yourself to sunlight for five to ten minutes daily, around noontime. Stick to these short intervals to make sure that your psoriasis is not aggravated by the sunlight.
 Do this in intervals of 30 seconds. Only increase your exposure after you are sure your skin can handle the sunlight.


Do not go over the recommended exposure time. Ultraviolet light can make psoriasis symptoms worse in large doses.
 Keep careful track of your exposure time and rotate accordingly.
 As you continue sunbathing, it is important to keep visiting your doctor to check your skin for sun damage and determine if the treatment is working.
 Do not use tanning beds as a replacement for natural light. Most tanning beds emit UVA light, not UVB. This will not help psoriasis and can make symptoms worse.

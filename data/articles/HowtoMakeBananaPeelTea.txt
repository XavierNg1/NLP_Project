Throw peels into your freezer.;

Fill a pan when you have enough peels.
Let them thaw in your pan for an hour or two.
They should turn black.



Put the peels in an oven at pasteurization temperature (~65C/150ÂºF).
Bake until dry. This should take less than one hour.

Glass jars (with or without gasket seals) are an excellent choice.



That is about as strong as a black tea bag.
Always adjust amounts to your taste.



The strainer can be lined with a paper coffee filter as well.
Alternatively, put the pulverized peels in a tea bomb, then submerge the bomb in hot water and let steep for a short while.

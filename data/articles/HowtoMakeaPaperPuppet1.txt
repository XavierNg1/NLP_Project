 Use a white paper bag for a bunny, polar bear or panda puppet.;
, This will be your puppet’s head.
 Each animal will be designed slightly differently. For example, mice, ducks and some other animals have point faces, rather than square heads.
 Bobble eyes, pipe cleaners and glitter can be used to improve a paper bag puppet.
 You will want to fold the edges into a triangle for a mouse or just an inch at the corner for a pig snout or dog nose.
 Get ideas or templates at www.enchantedlearning.com/crafts/puppets/paperbag/. For example, bunny ears should be long and pointy, while cat ears can be short, pointed with a contrasting color on the inside.
 You can also draw the nose on the front of the puppet’s head.
 Skip this step if your animal doesn’t have whiskers.
 You can also use two plastic bottle caps with tissue paper balls glued onto the inside of the cap. Glue them with the inside of the cap facing out on either side of the paper head., Decorate it with additional features, feathers or felt. Place your arm inside the bag and grasp the head between your fingers and thumb to make it talk.

 The journey method involves you mentally moving yourself through a location such as a house. Imagine a large house and assign each planet to a different room. Associate an image with each planet and give them a reason for being in a given room. Mentally visualize going through the rooms in the right order, visiting each planet along the way., The linking method of memorization involves taking the names of the planets and working them into a story that will help you remember the proper order.One such story is this:


“Imagine the hot sun. What do you see coming out of the sun? A tube that contains MERCURY of course. Who gets covered by the Mercury as it falls? The goddess VENUS. What does Venus do to escape from the burning metal? She digs a hole and builds up a pile of EARTH. Who gets upset by the noise made by digging the hole? The little red faced man (MARS is known as the red planet) eating a MARS bar. When he throws the MARS bar, who does it hit? It hits JUPITER the king of the gods. What has Jupiter got on his T-shirt? The letters S, U and N which stand for SATURN, URANUS and NEPTUNE. Who is the little dog following the chap wearing the T-shirt? The little dog looks just like PLUTO.”, When you have to teach information to someone else, you need to know the information pretty well yourself. This can help you with memorization.If you can’t get someone to help you, speak to yourself in a mirror as though you are teaching your reflection.
 See how well you perform by testing yourself as you study the planet names. Try to write down from memory all the planet names. See which ones you get right, which ones are wrong, and which you’ve forgotten altogether. After you study some more, test yourself again.
 Ask a friend or family member to help you study. Recite the names of the planets to them, and they can give you prompts in order to remember.

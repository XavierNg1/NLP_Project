 If you leave them for too long, they will release spores, which will lead to more mushrooms. When you see mushrooms appear, simply pull them out of the ground.


You can also try mowing or raking over the mushrooms, but this will heighten the chances of them spreading spores across your lawn.;
, Do not toss them into your compost pile. Instead, keep a plastic bag with you, and put them into the bag as soon as you pull them out of the ground. Once the bag is full, tie the bag up tightly, and toss it into a trashcan. This will help prevent the mushrooms from spreading spores across your lawn.
 The fertilizer will quicken the decomposition of the matter, which will leave the mushrooms nothing to feed off of. Plan on using 1 pound (453.59 grams) of nitrogen for every 1,000 square feet of lawn.









Do not use slow release or water-soluble nitrogen fertilizer.
You will need to do this annually.
Consider adding some phosphorous and potassium as well. You will need 3 parts nitrogen, 1 part phosphorous, and 2 parts potassium., Mix 2 to 3 tablespoons (29.6 to 44.4Â ml) of dish soap with 2 gallons (7.57 liters) of water. Poke holes into the soil around the mushrooms using a shovel, trowel, or screwdriver. Fill the holes with the soapy water.
 Potted plants are often subject to mushrooms and other types of fungi. They are often subject to over-watering, and stay indoors, where the air is warm and still. This is a perfect environment for mushrooms. Here are some simple ways to keep your potted plants mushroom-free:








Pluck mushrooms as soon as you see them appear, and toss them in the trash immediately.
Provide ample air circulation by keeping the plant need a window or fan.
Avoid over-watering. Let the soil become dry at top between watering.
Use a watering bulb to keep the soil deep inside the pot moist, and the upper layer dry.

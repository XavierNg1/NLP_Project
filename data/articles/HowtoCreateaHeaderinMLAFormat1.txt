 In general, you should use standard white 8.5" x 11" (or A4) paper when preparing a paper in MLA style. Make sure your word processor is set to this paper size before you format your header., The MLA does not specify a single font preference, although classic, simple, easy-to-read fonts are preferable. Times New Roman is probably the standard choice.Font size, however, is specified as 12-point.
The same font type and size should be used in both the header and the main body of the text.
MLA recommends that you choose a font that has clearly contrasting regular and italics fonts., MLA style specifies one-inch (2.54 cm) margins on all edges of the page.Since your page number should be aligned to the right margin, it should therefore be one inch from the right edge of the page. With the standard header and footer settings used with these margins, your header text will be one-half inch from the top of the page.
 If your last name is Smith, your header on page 3 will appear simply as "Smith 3".Consult with your instructor if there is another person with your last name in the class. He / she may want you to put "J. Smith 3".
MLA style also permits instructors to simply exclude the use of the last name in the header, leaving only the Arabic numeral page number.
 MLA style leaves it to the instructor / editor / author's discretion whether to include a first-page header or leave it blank.Title pages are not used in MLA format, so your full name will already appear on the first page of text.
Simply ask your instructor if he / she has a preference.

 If you have one nail that appears more damaged than the rest, it might be in your best interest to start with that nail. If all nails appear the same, however, you can pick any nail you wish.


If you find it difficult to break the habit all at once, working on one nail at a time can make things easier by allowing you to slowly build better habits instead of demanding too much of yourself all at once.
 You might be able to do so without help, but if you need some extra assistance, consider wrapping an adhesive bandage around the fingertip of your chosen nail. Doing so should block your access to the nail, making it harder to bite it.
 After a few days, a non-bitten nail will flourish and reward you.


Do not bite your chosen nail during this time. If you must, bite one of the 'unprotected' ones. Sometimes it even helps knowing that you have another nail to bite, even if you don't actually nibble at any unprotected ones.
 Once you have grown your non-bitten nail for a while, start protecting another one. During this time, however, it's important that you leave both the first and second nails alone. You wouldn't want to undo the good work you accomplished on the first nail by biting it after switching your focus to a new one!

, If you ever really feel the urge to bite your nails, do the reverse of this process by focusing on just one nail to bite. That should help you limit the amount of damage done to the other nails.

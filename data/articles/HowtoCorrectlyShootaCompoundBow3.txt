 Tense, tight muscles and jerky movements will greatly hurt your accuracy. So will trying to aim and shoot as quickly as you possibly can. Settle down, take a deep breath, and let your muscles relax. Try to think of gliding through every motion, working fluidly from one movement to the next.









Your stabilizing elbow (left arm) should be slightly bent at the elbow.
Keep your shoulders relaxed and chin up.
Your knees should be slightly bent., Moving the bow, such as pointing upwards while you aim, may feel like it is easier. But it is a bad habit that simply forces you to re-aim, and the constant movement is not only unhelpful, it could be dangerous if you don't have full control over the bow.
 A big mistake of beginners is immediately lowering the bow after firing the shot. Just like a golfer must keep their head down through the swing to keep their body aligned, you should keep your bow up through the entire shot to ensure you don't pull off target at the last moment. Focus on keeping the bow on target for 1-2 seconds after firing.
 The draw weight determines how hard you need to pull back on the string to fire the arrow. Too high and you'll ruin your form trying to get enough power -- too low and you'll have to pull the arrow back farther back to get the same shot. Many people start with 10lbs of draw weight. Typical draw weights by person include:









Child -- 15-25 lbs
Women & Teenagers-- 30-40 lbs
Men -- 40-55 lbs
Bowhunters-- 50-65 lbs, You'll see that over time your arrows will start coming together into a tight grouping. When all shot arrows stay close together, but not in the center of the target, then you will need to adjust your sight. This is easily done, usually with the aid of some Allen keys. To adjust the sight, move the pins with the arrow. If you shoot to the left of center, move your sight to the left. Re-tighten the screws and try again, re-adjusting as necessary.

Make sure spiders can’t get through any gaps in your exterior doors. Install door sweeps on all of your exterior doors; spiders can squeeze through an opening that is 1/16” (mm) tall.
Use caulk to seal the outside edges of your doors, but use foam weather-stripping to line the bottom track of sliding glass doors.;
, Gaps, cracks and holes can be filled with caulk, foam, cement and steel wool. Look for openings in these common entry points:


Outdoor faucets
Gas and electric meters
Cable TV wires
Dryer vents
Telephone wires
Outdoor electrical receptacles

,


Be sure to use a good caulking gun, one that has a back-off trigger which will stop the flow of caulk when you press it; otherwise, you will end up with too much caulk and you’ll end up with a mess.
Smooth the bead of caulk you apply with a damp rag so that it is even and you can see if you’ve missed any cracks.
 You can purchase screen repair kits at your local home and garden store.
 Wear gloves when you do this because the edges of the wire mesh are sharp and you may have to cut the mesh with wire snips to ensure it completely covers each opening.
 Spray the pesticide around the perimeter of your foundation.
, Don’t leave items outside, especially if you aren’t using them on a regular basis.

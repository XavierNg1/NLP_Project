 You can try calmly asking your boyfriend why you two don’t hold hands anymore. Just bring the conversation up casually like, “Hey, I was wondering why we don’t hold hands anymore.” Maybe he didn’t even realize that this is something you were thinking about.


If you ask him why you don’t hold hands anymore and he says that he doesn’t know why, then you should tell him that it is something you liked and that you miss it.
If he answers that he was afraid you didn’t want to hold hands with him, make sure to tell him that you really do want to hold hands with him.
 If you ask him why he hasn’t been holding your hand, make sure you really listen to what he says. Let him finish what he’s saying without interrupting him. Make eye contact and give other clues that you are really paying attention – like nodding your head or giving verbal cues that indicate you are listening.


Don’t get upset if it isn’t an answer you want to hear. This just means that you have something to talk about and work through as a couple.
 One very likely reason that your boyfriend hasn’t been holding your hand is that he is afraid of rejection. Reassure him that you like him and that you would never reject him if he tried to hold hands with you. Let him know that you care about him so that he has more confidence to hold your hand more in the future.This should help him be less afraid of making the move to hold hands with you.
 If you want to start holding hands with your boyfriend again, you could just tell him that in a direct way. He is your boyfriend, so he should care about your feelings and doing things to make you happy.


Try just asking, “Will you hold my hand?” Or you could say, “I liked it when we held hands before. Let's do that again.”

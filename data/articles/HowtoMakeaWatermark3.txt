 The following instructions are written generically; for specific instructions for your graphic editor program, consult the program's help file.
 You can make this file whatever size you wish, although you may need to resize it to match the size of the picture file you'll apply the watermark to.
 Layers are essentially transparent sheets on which you can place and arrange individual components to make up a graphic image. You'll later copy this layer to the graphic files you want to add your watermark to.
 If you're planning to watermark pictures for your Web site, your watermark text should include a copyright notice with your name, your Web site URL or both.


You may want to use a font with thick letters or bold it to make the watermark text distinct. You may also want to enhance the text appearance with beveling or embossed effects.
 This will let you call up the watermark another time and apply it to other graphic files.
, Depending on the graphic editor you're using, you can drag and drop the layer or copy the layer to the Clipboard and then paste it into the new graphic.
 You may want to save this file with a different name, in case you want to retain a copy of the graphic file without the watermark.

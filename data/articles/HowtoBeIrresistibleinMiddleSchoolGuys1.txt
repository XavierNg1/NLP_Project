 If you are a raggedy, dirty, bad-smelling guy, you are an immediate turn off for anyone- girls and boys alike.


Shower regularly, not daily. Twice a week is good because some studies show that a small bacterial build-up is actually good for your body.
Comb/brush your hair every day. Bed head can sometimes go in your favor, but it's better to play it safe. Find a hairstyle that works for you and use it every day.
If you feel the need, groom your eyebrows.
Use deodorant or any antiperspirant. Smelling good is absolutely necessary if you don't want to drive a girl away.
Brush, floss and use mouthwash on a bidaily basis.
Get plenty of sleep. Tired, bag-ridden guys look like zombies, and that is not going to attract anyone.;
, If you want someone to date you in middle school, you need to understand that until high school, most girls don't think guys their age are "hot"; they see "cute" and "adorable" instead.


Shave whatever you're trying to grow. One of the best methods to look cute to girls is to look boyish, and facial hair will not accomplish that whatsoever. Don't worry about not looking "manly" around your guy friends who have some decent stubble- you'll look a lot more manly if you get a lady friend.
If at all possible, be a little chubby. An attractive girl once told me that she liked guys with a little extra (but not too much) body weight because she thought it was, like I keep saying, "cute" to her and her friends.

 Begin with damp hair. The sections should be this shape because square sections form round dreads. Smaller sections make smaller dreads, and wider squares make larger dreads. One or two inch sections are ideal. Continue until all of your hair has been sectioned.You can temporarily secure each section with a rubber band.
Keep a spray bottle near you to dampen hair again when it dries.;
, Begin to comb your hair backwards. Start combing near the scalp—less than an inch away. Comb in the direction of the scalp. Roll the hair you are combing between your fingers to help the process. Comb repeatedly until the hair starts to pack up near the roots.Don’t use a weak dread comb that will snap and break easily. Look for one that has bristles that are strong and close together.You can purchase a dread comb at many beauty supply stores and Walmart.
 Do this until you reach the ends of your hair. Make sure to work slowly. Try to make the dreads as tight as possible as you comb., Once you are finished combing, secure the ends of your hair with a rubber band. Small rubber bands are best to use. You can also secure the roots of your dreads. Remove the rubber bands once the dreads start to mature.You can remove the rubber bands when the locks stay in shape on their own.
 Apply wax to each lock when are done using rubber bands. Make sure that the wax does not contain petroleum because it will cause unwanted buildup. The wax should help you maintain the shape of the locks and speed up the process.You can buy dread wax at many beauty supply stores and online.

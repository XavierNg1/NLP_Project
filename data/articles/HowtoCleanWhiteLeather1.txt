 Not only is it easy and cost-effective to make your own liquid cleaner, but it can be safer for your leather. Many synthetic cleaning products, especially ones that are petroleum-based, can actually discolor, stain, or change the surface quality of your leather.Here are some easy recipes for making your own liquid cleaner out of common household products:


Mix 1 part mild soap (the kind you would use on your face or clothes) with 8 parts warm water.
Mix 2 parts vinegar with 1 part linseed oil.;
, It’s important not to use too much liquid directly on the leather, as this can over-saturate the leather and cause “watermark” staining. Instead, try using a spray bottle or applying your cleaner to a micro-fiber cloth rather than onto the leather.
 Be careful not to rub to aggressively, as this can embed the dirt into the leather rather than remove it.
 It’s not really necessary to rinse off your homemade cleaner, instead you can gently buff it into an even shine. If your item is still dirty, wait a little while and try applying some more cleaner.

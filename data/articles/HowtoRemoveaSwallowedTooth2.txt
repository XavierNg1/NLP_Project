 Dentures are the second most often object accidentally swallowed, second only to fish and other food-ingested bones.Swallowed dentures can present some complications that may not be present with teeth.
 Unfortunately, dentures or crowns that have come loose are less likely to be noticed by patients, and the lack of early recognition can present more serious health issues.


The nature of dental prostheses' design and the materials used can be more harmful to the digestive tract and organs, as well as being more likely than teeth to become stuck.They are made out of metal, ceramic, or plastic and none of these materials is biocompatible and they can harm the digestive tissue.
If you wear dentures, check often to be sure they are intact. Do not sleep wearing your dentures.Partial dentures have metal wires that can break after a while. Make sure that you check your dentures often to see if they are intact or otherwise you may swallow a part of them while you are eating.
 If you suspect that you’ve accidentally swallowed a denture, it’s best to see a doctor, especially if you’ve experienced any of the pain symptoms mentioned above in regards to teeth.


Often the physician will recommend waiting and watching at first, but may also order an X-ray to determine the size, shape, and location of the dental prosthesis. It’s possible that the denture will pass easily through your digestive system. If this is the case, follow the same procedures as with a tooth.
When you’ve recovered the denture, clean and disinfect it. This can be done by soaking it in a 1:10 solution of household bleach and water.

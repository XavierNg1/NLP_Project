 It’s important to combine dry ingredients first because the dry ingredients are much lighter than the liquid ones. When you mix them all together instead of separately, the lighter ingredients float to the top.This will ensure that your waffles work out well.;
, Be sure to wait until the melted butter has cooled sufficiently before you mix it into the other ingredients because if it is too warm, it'll cause the flour to form lumps., In addition, you could fold stiff egg whites into the batter to make them much fluffier (stiff egg whites are just egg whites that have been whipped until they create stiff peaks) because the egg whites are fluffy and they create light and airy waffles.A well is a hole in the ingredients. Basically you have to "dig" a hole in the dry ingredients and then pour the wet ingredients into the well.
 Spread the waffle batter evenly across the iron (not too much or it will overflow). Wait until the iron begins to steam (each iron may have a different way of telling you when your waffle is done, trust your waffle iron). Keep in mind that if you open the machine too early, your waffle will rip open and a waffle is never as enjoyable when it is not perfect., Serve with your choice of… anything! This includes chocolate, maple syrup, butter, whipped cream, ice cream, caramel, and the like. Waffles taste good with nothing and everything, just be creative and spice things up if you don't want to leave it plain. Serve warm and fresh.

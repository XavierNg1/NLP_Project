 Designed for usage for indoors and on flat surfaces, reach forklifts (also known as high-reach forklifts) are named for their ability to reach high shelves. Depending on the forklift manufacturer, the reaching mechanism may be a moving mast type, or a moving forks and carriage type.

Reach forklifts drive differently, compared to counterbalance forklifts because the operator sits (or stands, depending on the model) sideways on the forklift.
Reach forklifts are designed for narrow warehouse aisle use; the operator is able to look forward or backward without the neck strain of having to turn around. This sideways operator position, alongside with reversed steering controls, makes reach forklifts considerably challenging for a new operator to learn.
 Double deep reach forklifts are very similar to reach forklifts. However, as the name suggests, they are able to retrieve/put away pallets that are stored in double deep racking, which are pallets that are stored one in front of each other in specially designed racks., Although an order picker forklift is considered a type of forklift, it is not used for regular forklift operations. Order picker forklifts require the operator to wear a harness, as they are used for lifting pallets alongside with the operator up into the air. The operator typically picks up individual units of a product to manually stack on a pallet; this is opposed to regular order picking, where workers can only pick products from ground level. This requires a forklift operator to replenish ground level product pallets if they run out. An order picker forklift can allow operators to pick products quickly and efficiently at any level in the air., The only main disadvantage of them is that they must be operated on flat ground, and they cannot be operated on slopes or uneven ground; they are top heavy, and this increases the risk of it tipping over.

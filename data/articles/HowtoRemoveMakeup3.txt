 You can really slather it on--not only will this help you remove the lipstick in one attempt, but it will also moisturize your lips.Don't bother investing in an expensive moisturizer for this. You will use a lot of product and remove it almost immediately, so an inexpensive, drug-store brand is perfect.You can also try subbing olive or coconut oil for petroleum jelly, but it can be a bit messy to apply to your lips.
 The oil in the petroleum jelly is dissolving the oil in your lip color, which is what makes it so effective. It is drawing the oil out of your lips instead of repelling it, like water would., You can wipe your lips in a small, circular motion, but try not to move the pad too much--you don't want to wipe the jelly all over your face., Most, if not all, of the lipstick should come off on the pad.Repeat if necessary. If there's still some lipstick left, don't go rubbing your lips raw trying to get it off. Getting too rough can chap your lips., Exfoliating will remove any remaining color tint or flakes.Moisturizing will keep your lips soft and healthy so your pout is lipstick-ready when you wake up.You can use an exfoliator specifically designed to buff your lips; a clean, wet tooth brush, or a mix of brown sugar and honey.
Use gentle, circular motions to exfoliate your lips. Again, you don't want to be too rough and end up with raw, chapped lips.

, Start populating your code. The common base text is provided below:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
<title>Place Your Title Here</title>
</head>
<body>
Place Content Here
</body>
</html>

, A link tag is indicated by placing <a href="#id of element you want to link to">Place Description Here</a> where you would like the link to be.
 Type ""id="" within the tag portion. Like so:

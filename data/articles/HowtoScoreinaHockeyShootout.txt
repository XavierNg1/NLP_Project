, It is important to go as fast as possible while keeping the puck under control. The faster you go, the more difficult it is for the goalie to react to what you are doing.
 Ideally, you want to be skating forward, faster than the goalie is skating backward.
 If the goalie moving back too quickly and is close to the net, then you want to shoot because you can see more of the net.
 Hopefully you will score a goal in the process. The main thing in the shootout is to score and give your team the advantage, while also putting pressure on the opposing player to score for their team.

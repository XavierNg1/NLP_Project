 If you don't have olive oil, you can substitute avocado oil, coconut oil, grapeseed oil, or palm oil – and it'll still be healthy.Don't be tempted to use much more oil than that; oil will be brushed on the aubergine later. If you bombard the aubergine with even more, it'll take on a fried yet soggy texture.
 Slice it in 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) slices, or however your recipe calls for. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. You can also add any other spices you'd like to accompany the aubergine, too.


If you’d like, coat the aubergine slices in breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese. You’ll need around ⅓ cup of breadcrumbs and 1 or 2 tablespoons of Parmesan for one, good-sized aubergine. Mix it up and dip each slice in before adding it to the pan.
 Each side will need to cook for about 5 minutes or until golden. Don't walk away from the pan – there's a window of perfection that, if missed, will result in your slices blackening too much. Keep turning as need be for browned perfection.


Looking for a zestier kick? Add some soy sauce into the mix (but keep some for dipping later). Introduce whatever other flavors you think would pair well, too.
 Place them onto a paper towel to sop up the extra oil. Give them a few minutes to cool down and then it's chow time.


Aubergine is tasty with soy sauce, ranch, or even plain. They're a great complement to any meal, putting a new twist on boring ol' veggies.

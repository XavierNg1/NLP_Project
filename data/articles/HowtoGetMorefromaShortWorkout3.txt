 Short workouts are more convenient than longer workouts because you only need 10 to 20 minutes. Many workouts donâ€™t even require a gym, so you can do them in your home. You need to find time for these workouts in your week because if you are not consistent, you are not going to see any results.You should do the workouts at least three days a week. Three to six days will help you see results.
 Since the workouts are so short, you can fit them in to almost any time of your day. No matter how busy you are, you can find 10 minutes to do an intense routine. Look at your daily schedule and figure out when you would like to incorporate the workout.For example, you can do the workout right before you shower or right after you get home from work. You may consider doing it during your lunch hour or waking up 15 minutes earlier each day.
 Though you are doing short workouts, you can still get a great overall total body workout. Try incorporating different kinds of exercises and types of activity. This helps you work different parts of your body and helps you to not get bored with your workout.


For example, you may do Tabata one day, a short all-out sprint of four minutes one day, interval training one day, and combo moves another day.
 Music is a great motivation for working out and moving faster. For short workouts, music can be a great push to work stronger for that short duration. Depending on the workout, you may listen to a song or two and be done. Put together a playlist of songs that make you want to get up, move, and push yourself to your limit.


For example, you may choose music with fast tempos, songs that make you happy or excited, or songs that make you feel like you are strong and invincible.

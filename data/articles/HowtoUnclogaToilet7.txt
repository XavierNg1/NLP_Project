 If you have tried plunging and snaking to no avail, consider using a wet/dry vacuum. Do not use an ordinary vacuum cleaner––it must be the wet/dry variety that can cope with water.
 The bowl must be free of water and any other debris in order to vacuum out the obstruction.
 Push it into the toilet bowl a few inches into the hole. Use just the flexible hose, rather than an attachment. Coil an old towel around the hole to create a seal around the drain.
 Use one hand to put pressure on the towels to create a good seal. Wait a moment or two for the vacuum to work. There's a good chance the vacuum can suck out the clog.

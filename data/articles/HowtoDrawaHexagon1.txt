 Place a pencil in your compass. Widen the compass to an appropriate width for the radius of your circle. It can be just a few inches or centimeters wide. Next, place the point of the compass on the paper and sweep the compass around until you've created a circle.


Sometimes it's easier to draw a half-circle in one direction, and then to come back and draw another half-circle in the other direction.;
, Move it towards the top of the circle. Do not change the angle or settings of the compass.
 Make it distinct, but not too dark -- you'll be erasing it later. Remember to maintain the angle you've set for the compass.
 Place the point right on the mark.
 This should create a second mark a distance away from the first mark. If you’ve been moving clockwise or counterclockwise around the circle, continue to do so.
 You should end up back at the mark where you originally started. If you don’t, it’s likely that the angle of your compass changed while you worked, possibly from squeezing it too firmly or letting it loosen a bit.
 The six places where your marks cross the edge of the circle are the six points of your hexagon. Use your ruler and a pencil to draw a straight line segment that connects the adjacent dots.
 These include your original circle, the marks along the edges, and any other marks you made along the way. Once you've erased your guiding lines, your perfect hexagon should be complete.

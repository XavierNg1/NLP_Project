, The software provides a template library from where you can choose a suitable banner template. The templates are filtered by different industries and sizes. You can choose your favorite template on the basis of your industry and size of the banner you want and open the template. However, if you don’t have any intention to use the pre-designed banner template, you can simply move ahead without selecting any template. This will help you to enter into the real work space, where you can start creating your banner from scratch.
 If you are using a pre-designed banner template, then edit the text already present on it to make it customized as per your needs. If you are making banner from scratch, add the required text. Edit the properties of the text, like font size, font face, color, formatting etc.
 The graphical elements are shapes, images, buttons, clip arts and symbols etc. These graphical elements can be added or edited any time on the banner.

 Apply advanced effects on the banner. Modify the background or graphical elements and apply animation and transition to different banner objects.

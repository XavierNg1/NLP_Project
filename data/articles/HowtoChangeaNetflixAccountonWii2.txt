 Profiles allow you to have different sets of history and recommendations for a single account. This makes it easy to share an account with your family or friends. If you switch profiles, you don't need to log out and log in to the Netflix app. If you aren't able to switch profiles, you'll need to update your Netflix app.

You can't create profiles from the Wii U, but you can create them at the Netflix Account Management page (movies.netflix.com/YourAccount).
Switch profiles by selecting the profile image in the upper-right corner of the Netflix app on your Wii U. You'll also be prompted to select a profile when you start the app for the first time.
 If you'd rather sign out instead of use different profiles, you can do so from within the Netflix app itself., You can open this by selecting the Gear icon at the top of the Netflix screen., You will be signed out of the Wii U app, and prompted to log in with a different account.

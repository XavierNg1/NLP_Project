 The miniature pinscher is the perfect choice if you live in an apartment. These small dogs can get adequate activity in the house and with a few walks a day. If left alone in the fenced yard, make sure it is secure since the min pin may try to escape., The miniature pinscher is highly intelligent and it learns very quickly. Without proper training as a puppy, the min pin can become stubborn, but with persistence, even older dogs who try to assert dominance and resist training can be trained. As long as you take the time to interact with and integrate your min pin into the home, they are wonderful, highly entertaining pets.


Don’t leave a min pin alone with nothing to do. They're intelligent dogs and need mental stimulation to prevent destructive behavior.
Protect your min pin from cold. Because of their small size and short coat, min pins are sensitive to cold weather. Plan to keep them mostly indoors during cold weather. Try a dog sweater or coat on them during winter when they are outdoors., Whether this is your first dog or your 50th, you never really know how you’ll bond with your new pet. For this reason, most breeders and retailers have a return policy. The goal is to make sure you have the right dog for your home and family, and that the dogs are able to find a home where they’ll be safe and happy. Take advantage of these policies if you need to.

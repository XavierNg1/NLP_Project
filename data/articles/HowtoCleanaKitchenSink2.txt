 This will sanitize your sink in preparation for cleaning. Vinegar works as an alternative disinfectant to more harmful things like bleach, although it removes less bacteria than dish soap or bleach., Completely cover the surface and wait anywhere from 15 minutes to a few hours (the longer you wait, the more stains it will lift). Hydrogen peroxide has bleaching properties in it without the eye-watering smell. Rinse this away using warm water. It should take some of the stains with it, but if not, give it a bit of a scrub and rinse., Dampen a sponge and apply a bit of elbow grease. The baking soda should foam up a little bit, which will creep inside some of the cracks to loosen the dirt, which you can then wash away. Again, use a toothbrush to reach into small cracks., Pour small piles of salt onto any remaining stains. Cover each salt pile with the juice of half of a lemon (or more if needed). Let it sit for about 5 minutes, and then scrub it with a clean piece of cloth or a sponge. Be aware that the salt may scratch the porcelain if you scrub too hard and the porcelain is delicate and new., Place 3 to 4 drops of lemon oil onto a dry cloth and wipe it around the sink. Add more if necessary, using only a couple drops at a time. Besides smelling fresh, the oil helps to keep soap from resting on the surface and building up, keeping future cleanup much easier.

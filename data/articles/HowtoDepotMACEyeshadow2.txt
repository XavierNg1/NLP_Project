 After you’ve freed the shadow’s plastic housing from the compact, light a small candle. Use a pair of pliers to allow you to hold the back of the plastic housing over the candle’s flame without burning yourself. Hold the plastic housing over the flame for 30 seconds to 1 minute or until the adhesive holding the pan inside the housing starts to melt.A small tea light is an ideal candle to use for depotting your eyeshadow.
Don’t allow the flame to actually touch the plastic or it may catch fire. Hold it several inches above the flame.
 After 30 seconds or so, take your pointed tool and press it against the back of the plastic housing. The goal is to push the eyeshadow pan out of the housing once the adhesive is weak enough.You don’t want to force the pan out of the housing if the adhesive is still strong or you may break the eyeshadow in the process. If the pan won’t come loose when you press against the back, hold it over the flame again to melt the adhesive further.
When you’re pressing against the back of the housing, it helps to target the center of the plastic.
 After you free the eyeshadow from the plastic housing, the metal pan will likely be hot. Let it cool for several minutes before you label it, place it in a palette, or otherwise handle it.Set the eyeshadow pan on a trivet or potholder to cool so you don’t have to worry about the heat damaging your work surface.

 Show the person who wronged you that his immaturity doesn’t affect you by deciding to just let it go.
 Deciding to let it go doesn’t mean ignoring what happened. Feel free to confront the person who wronged you and tell him that what he did isn’t ok.


Letting it go also doesn’t have to mean that things stay the same. For example: stop letting your friend take advantage of your relationship by not loaning him things or letting him use your stuff.
 You can’t change the past, but you can change how you let what happened affect your future.


Dwelling on things that have happened to you isn't always bad, but when you can't let something go, especially if it's a negative memory or feeling, you can get stuck in a sort of neutral zone.If you're taking the high road approach and deciding to move forward, try setting positive goals to accomplish or flip negative feelings into positive ones. For example: if your coworker made you look bad, maybe it's a cry for help. Perhaps he actually looks up to you and values you. In the future try and help him with his work.
 And just because you forgive, doesn’t mean you have to forget.


Forgiveness can come in plenty of forms, from simply telling someone that you forgive him to helping him accomplish something he's having trouble with.
Express your feelings verbally. Tell him why his actions offended you, and how he made you feel.
Put yourself in his shoes. What's the reason for his actions? Think of a time you felt similar and what you did to move past the situation.
If all else fails, just breathe. Take some time to yourself and take a few deep breaths, try to remember that the world is larger than you and what's going on in your life.

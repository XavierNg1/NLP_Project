 Olive oil contains a strong antifungal compound, derived from olives, called oleuropein.


Oleuropein is a strong agent against fungus like Aspergillus niger.
Olives are special as an antifungal agent because instead of killing Aspergillus niger immediately, the oleuropein first disrupts the reproductive ability of the fungus.
This quickly halts the spread of Aspergillus niger.
Then, it cuts off the food supply of the fungus, eradicating Aspergillus niger.
Olive oil can be taken orally, by mixing it with your food, or as a topical treatment on skin wounds.
A safe and effective intake of olive oil is 25 to 40 mL in a day., Coconut oil contains lauric, capric, and caprylic acids, which have potent antifungal characteristics.

A recommended antifungal dose of coconut oil is 3 - 6 tablespoons a day or 45 â€“ 90 mL of coconut oil integrated in your food as part of your diet.

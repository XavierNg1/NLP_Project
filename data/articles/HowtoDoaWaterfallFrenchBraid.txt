 Clear your hair of any tangles and smooth it completely for the easiest braiding. If your hair is particularly coarse or frizzy, dampen it slightly or use a shine serum to smooth it down.

, Start at the front of your head, and grab a section that is as wide as you would like the braid to be. Split this major section into three even pieces.
,,,,,, Move the left strand over the center, pick up a new strand of hair on the right, move this piece over the center, and drop it. Do this for as long as you want your braid to last.
 The further along in the braiding process you go, the more and more your braid will begin to have the illusion of a waterfall. When you reach the point at which you feel your braid is complete, you can stop or finish with a regular braid. At either point, secure the end with an elastic band.
 Finger brush through the waterfall strands you dropped from your braid to make sure that they are tangle-free. Leave your hair hanging down for the best effect, and use a pretty pin or headband to complete the look. Give your hair a light misting of hairspray, and youâ€™re done!

 You're going to need something to that resembles a small gem to use as the nose stud, and glue to secure the nose stud in place. The stud can be made of jewels, beads, sequins, or anything with a tiny, flat surface. For the adhesive, fake eyelash glue is recommended, as it is soft and doesn't harm the skin. 








You can get these materials online or at any craft store.
Avoid any glues that can be harmful to your skin, particularly super glues. These can be dangerous and cause harm.
 Once you've gotten your fake eyelash glue and gem of choice, it's time to make your nose stud.









Place your materials on a flat surface covered in paper towel, ideally close to a mirror. The paper towel will prevent eyelash glue on any surfaces, and will catch your nose stud if you accidentally drop it.
If you're not sure what type of gem you'd like to use, hold a few in place to see which you like the most.
 Start by putting a dab of fake eyelash glue onto the back of your chosen gem. Using too much glue will look sloppy and prevent your nose stud from drying. Let the glue set for 20 seconds, then place the stud on your nose.
 Do not press hard on your nose stud, holding it gently in place will suffice. It will take roughly 30 seconds for the nose stud to dry.
 Welcome to your new reflection, nose stud and all. As long as you do not play with or move your fake piercing, and as long as you don't sweat, it should stay in place for a full day. Remember, it is being held in pace by glue.
 To remove, simply twist your fake nose stud, and it will come right off; extremely easy and painless.

 You must, at a minimum, learn the major and minor scales. These two scales, played across the guitar, can guide you throw 90% of the songs thrown your way. If a song is in the key of C-major, you have the entire C-major scale at your disposal. The following scale is for A-major, but you simply start it on whatever note you want to put it in the key of this note. Bolded notes are the roots, or the two A notes.


G|-----5----6---7---|
D|-----5----6---7---|
A|--4--5--------7---|
E|------5--------7---|, The minor scale generally has a "darker" or more "moody tone to it. The A-minor scale located below is a good fit for songs in A-minor. Again, bolded notes indicate root notes.


G|--4--5-------7------|
D|------5-------7------|
A|------5-------7--8--|
E|------5-------7--8--|, This handy trick will double the number of notes at your disposal when playing songs, though it is important to note that they still have different feels. To find the notes, take the major scale in the key you're playing, for example, the A major shown above. If you start a minor scale on the second note of the major scale, in this case the 7th fret B, all of these notes will fit in your song as well!


Otherwise put, a song in A-major can use either the A-major scale or the B-minor scale.
This relationship holds up and down the fretboard.
 For example, you could play just A, E, and D if the chords are A7, E7, and D7. But you could also play some of those 7th notes, which simply mean the 7th note in the associated scale. So, if the guitarist is playing an A7, you can also hit the 7th not in the A-major scale (2nd string, 6th fret) to sound amazing.


If you're struggling with the numbers, just ask the guitarist to show you the chord. All the notes he's playing on his top four strings will match the notes on your four strings., Many bassists can play 10 notes and sound good, but only the best players can play one note and make it sound amazing. Bass is a very physical instrument, and your ability to handle and manipulate the strings is how you wring emotion and power out of every note:



Vibrato: Keeping your finger on the string, shake your hand up and down. You should hear the note "waving" based on how high or far you shake the string.

Bends: With your finger on the fret, use 2-3 fingers to push the string up the neck. You should hear the note's pitch change as you bend the string. You can also pull the string downward, too.

Slides: Play a note and, without taking your hand off the string, slide down to the next note you want to play, fluidly transitioning down.

Hammer-Ons: Instead of plucking a note, slam your finger down on the string at the fret you want, sounding it out with just this hand.

Pull-Offs: When removing your finger from a fret, use your fretting hand to pluck the string instead of coming straight off., If you stick to root notes, their octaves, and the 5th, you can create many interesting, melodic, and moving basslines. The 5th is simply the 5th note in the scale -- even if that particular chord isn't being used. You can slide the 5th note between other roots to effortlessly slid up and down the neck. Check the lick below, played over a simple C, G, D chord progression illustrated below.


G|------------5---------------------------------------------------------------|
D|---------5-----5--------------------------5--------------------------------|
A|----3--------------0--3--0---2-------5-----5-----------------------------|
E|---------------------------------------------------3----------3/10----10--|
|-C-Major-|-----------------|-G-Major-|--------------------|-D-Major-|

, The bass is a very low, deep frequency, and you'll notice that it shakes the room when played loud. This is great, except when that shaking sounds out the strings you aren't even playing! To avoid this, bass players must use their whole hand to keep other strings mute, which you can do by simply laying a finger on the string to keep it still:


When you play a note, let your finger come up, resting on the string above it to mute it. Don't pull your hand away from the guitar after plucking. Do the same thing when plucking your thumb downward, resting it on the string below.
Use your ring and pinky fingers to mute lower strings, resting them on all strings below the two plucking fingers.
Use your thumb to mute higher strings, resting it on strings above the ones you're playing., There are endless options available to you, from new scales to modes and melodic tricks, that only come from time spent learning music theory. Start with the basics, like the circle of fifths, before moving on to scale composition and more fun tricks and tips.


At the very least, learn how to form the pentatonic scales, which are simplified versions of your major and minor scales.

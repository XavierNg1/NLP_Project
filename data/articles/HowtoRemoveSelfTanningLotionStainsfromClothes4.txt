 You can get a stain out of white clothes by bleaching them. Use an Oxygen-based bleach and make a solution based on the instructions on the bottle. Be sure to use a large bowl and fill it with solution so that your garment will be able to soak in it. Make sure that your garment can withstand bleach. Some delicate fabrics can be damaged by bleach.
Only use bleach if your garment is white. If not, it could alter the color of the garment.
Only use bleach if you have already tried out other methods of removing the stain. Bleach should be last resort because it can change the appearance of clothing.
 Place the garment into the bowl of solution so that it is completely submerged. At the minimum, soak the garment for a few hours. Do not leave the shirt in the bleach for over eight hours: this could damage the garment. , Run cool water over the piece of clothing and try to get off the bleach solution. See if the stain is gone. If the stain is still there, repeat the process of soaking in bleach. , Once the stain has come out, launder the garment as usual. You may want to wash the garment alone since there will be remnants of bleach that could affect other items being washed.

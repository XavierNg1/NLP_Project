 Sometimes, people go on and on in conversations because they genuinely struggle with self-expression. If this is the case, try to listen actively. This can promote mutual understanding, allowing the speaker to figure out his or her words.


Simply listen to what the speaker is saying, using non-verbal cues like smiling and nodding to show you are paying attention.When the speaker completes a thought, try to reiterate what was said. Say something like, "So, I'm hearing you're stressed about the work deadline." This gives the speaker a chance to clarify if you missed anything.Active listening can allow the speaker to feel heard early on, allowing the conversation to end gracefully on its own.
 If someone has been going on for awhile without pause, try to insert yourself in the conversation to help them reach their point. Gently say something, "So, I feel like I'm hearing..." and then offer an interpretation. This may help the speaker clarify what he or she is trying to convey.The speaker may resist if you try to interrupt him or her. He or she may say something like, "No, wait. I wasn't finished." You can politely say, "Oh, sorry. I just want to clarify something to make sure I understand."By helping the speaker clarify, you may be able to push the conversation to its conclusion early on. This will allow you to exit the conversation.
 While you may want to help someone who's struggling to express him or herself, you're not doing that person a favor by listening past a point that's reasonable. People learn to better communicate based on social cues and interactions. If a conversation has been going on for too long, it's okay to politely end things. You can use one of the tactics above to gracefully step out of the conversation.

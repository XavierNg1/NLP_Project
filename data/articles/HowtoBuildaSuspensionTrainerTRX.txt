 Make the PVC the same length as the grips.

Make sure to get the PVC size that fits the inner grip diameter the best. It should be a snug fit.;
,, Tie the cord in a double fisherman's knot. This is creating your handle. Repeat for the other handle trying to keep the tails of the knots the same length to ensure that the loops are the same., Now you should be left with two handles that have 6mm accessory cord run through them like a loop, as well as one long piece of thicker rope.,, If need be, wrap the webbing loop around an anchor point and clip the carabiner to it.

Note: You can also girth hitch it and leave out the carabiner but this can cause wear and weakening of the system.
 Clip the rope into the carabiner., It is crucial to make sure the knot is tight. Weight it securely prior to using it.,, Simply loosen the prusik a bit and slide it up or down. Make sure that the knot is proper and tight before using it again.

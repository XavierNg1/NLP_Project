 It is difficult to use software to redact a scanned file, such as a tiff, jpeg, or gif. There is a risk of the hidden text or metadata remaining in the scanned document. You may want to try to paper document method for scanned documents, where you print out the document and redact the information by hand., Start by printing out the paper document using the one sided print option. This will ensure you have text on one side of the paper and a blank page on the other side. You will not be at risk of cutting out important information on one side or neglecting to remove sensitive information on one side.Keep in mind this method may be time consuming if you have many pages of a paper document that you need to redact. However, this is considered the most effective way of redacting information from a document, whether it is a text file, a PDF, or a scanned document.
 Use scissors to cut out all text that you need to redact. Make sure you find every mention of the sensitive information in the paper document and cut it out.You should then shred the paper clippings to ensure the cut out information cannot be traced or found.
 Opaque tape is 100% impenetrable by light and is not transparent or translucent. This is the best option for filling in the redacted sections so they cannot be traced or uncovered.You can also use opaque paper that does not allow any light reflection, not plain-paper as a scanner can pick up images through the paper. Use tape or glue to attach the paper over the redacted sections.
 To create a polished version of the paper document, you can scan the document and save it as the “Final-redacted” PDF of the document. You will now have a fully redacted version of the paper document.

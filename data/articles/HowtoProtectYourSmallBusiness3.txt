 While most small businesses can benefit from Facebook pages and Twitter profiles, remember that the digital dialogue can include people unhappy with your business.

Use online conversations to promote your products and services, and invite your customers and clients to discuss what they like about working with you.
Do not overreact to negative comments. Deleting anything that sheds unfavorable light on your small business might damage your reputation even more. You want to be transparent. Have a trusted customer or supportive partner respond to any attacks against your business with a positive story or testimonial.
 If something happens that can damage your reputation, you need to be prepared. Prepare a plan to respond to customers, the media and any other stakeholders., Keeping a PR team on retainer might be prohibitive for your small business. However, talk to PR professionals about engaging their services on a per-project basis.

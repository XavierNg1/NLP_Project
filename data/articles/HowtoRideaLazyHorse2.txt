 If your horse does not have the speed or impulsion you want from the beginning of the lesson, do not settle for a slower pace. Make a constant effort to make your horse move forward. Make it clear that you will not take “no” for an answer. Don’t be overly aggressive, but make sure that your horse knows exactly what you want. Do not kick aggressively, yell, or slap your horse with your crop too hard. Squeeze with your legs and keep light contact.
 If you ask your horse to trot and he continues walking, do not stop asking for the trot until you get the trot. If you ask your horse to trot and he gets away with not trotting, he will know that he can get away with it further into your ride, too. Be persistent.
 Make sure that you are asking for what you want correctly. Ask your trainer or a more experienced rider friend to watch you ride your lazy horse and evaluate your use of the aids. Are you using your leg correctly? Are you pulling his mouth too much?The use of aids differs for every discipline, so your use of the aids will be different depending on whether you ride hunt seat, dressage, or western.
Ask your trainer for tips on encouraging your horse to move forward.

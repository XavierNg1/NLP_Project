 Avoid wearing anything that shows too much skin, shows your tattoos, or is too tight. You want to look classic, polished, and well put together. Looking sexy may work for a date night with your boyfriend, but it will not impress his parents.


Also dress for the occasion. You wouldn't wear stilettos or dress shoes to a lunch in the park or a family BBQ.Avoid wearing clothing with language or images that may be offensive.;
, Your boyfriend knows his parents better than you do and can help you choose an outfit.Put together a few outfits that show your personal style, but are also parent friendly. Some sample outfits you may consider include:


If you are going somewhere casual, jeans or pants with a blouse works well. Your pants or jeans should not be too tight.You can also add a blazer or a jacket to your outfit as well.
If you need something a little dressier, a simple dress with a modest hemline works. Choose a dress that hits right above your knee or longer.
A skirt and a top are also an option. Again, the skirt should not be too short. You should be able to sit down comfortably.
 Choose an outfit that makes you feel confident. Your clothing should not be a distraction to you or his parents. When you are confident in your looks, you can focus on spending time with him and getting to know his parents.For example, you do not want to sit through dinner and constantly wonder if your bra strap is showing.
If you have any doubts about an item of clothing, go with something else.
 If you wear make up, go for a natural look. Skip the bold lip colors or dramatic eye makeup. Jewelry is fine, but stick to simple items like studs instead of large hoops.


Your jewelry and makeup should not be a distraction.If you want to wear a larger piece of jewelry such as a statement necklace, keep the rest of your jewelry to a minimum.
If you are wearing nail polish, make sure that it is neat and not chipped.

Always remember - the Sheriff is your biggest enemy in the game., When the game begins, don't take your knife out; if you do, the innocents will see it and will report you to the sheriff. Rather, if you see the Sheriff, wait until you get near them, take out your knife, and quickly kill them., When you kill the Sheriff, protect the gun from the innocents. If you don't protect it, the Innocents will get it and will have a chance to kill you. Stay near the gun in order to prevent others from getting to it., If time runs out and you hadn't expected your sheriff, you can start killing the innocent one on one secretly.

 Homework usually takes up a good chunk of the students' grades. Handing it in late can result in points being taken off.
 Review the assignment after receiving it, and if it appears there is something not understood, ask for help from the teacher. It is okay to attempt the question first, but if it is too difficult, ask the teacher what is being done or understood wrong.
 If this happens, call or email the teacher as soon as possible. Ask for what was said during the lesson, if any homework was handed out, and what needs to be done to make up the missed class. This not only improves a student's grade, but it shows responsibility.

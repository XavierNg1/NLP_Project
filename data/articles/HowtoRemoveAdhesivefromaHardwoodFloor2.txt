You may need to use an extension cord., Direct the heat gun toward the adhesive. Place the heat gun as close to the adhesive as possible without touching it. Continue until you see the adhesive begin to give and melt., Use an old, but clean, towel to begin to wipe away the melted adhesive. You may want to re-heat the adhesive and wipe again.
 Carefully move your floor scraper over the surface of any remaining adhesive. Move gently enough to avoid damaging your floor.

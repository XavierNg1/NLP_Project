 Try this method if your battery is draining more quickly than it used to.
 Even if the computer is turned off, the battery may still have enough charge to power the LED power light. You'll know the battery is completely drained when the power light no longer blinks.
 Plug the computer back in to begin the charging process, but don’t turn the computer on. If the computer turns on without your prompting, shut it down right away.
 Don’t turn the computer on for the entire 48 hour charging period.
 The battery should now be able to hold a charge better than before.

 This way, enemies won't see you sneak up on them.;
, If you pick them you will make less noise, attracting fewer enemies. Also, guards may raise an alarm if they find that a lock is broken.
, Movement while crouched is slowed. The slower you move, the more quietly you move, so you won't be easily noticed.
 That means using the air vents and pipes instead of the short and easy paths. The road less traveled makes all the difference!

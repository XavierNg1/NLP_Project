 Sometimes a full-sized corn dog is a lot for one stomach to handle. Mini corn dogs are perfect for kids' birthday parties. Buy mini hot dogs or cut full-sized hot dogs in half, then skewer them, batter them and fry them the same way you would full-sized dogs.
 Who says corn dog batter has to be used only for hot dogs? Most meats and vegetables taste great fried in the crispy cornmeal batter. If you can put it on a skewer, you can make it into a crunchy corn treat. If you're using shrimp, make sure it's peeled and de-veined first, then skewer it in two places (so it won't fall off), bread it, and fry it according to the instructions.









Play around with different condiments to serve with shrimp corn dogs, like cocktail sauce instead of ketchup.
Make hush puppies with the extra batter - they're the perfect complement to any seafood.
 Make the vegetarians in your life happy by choosing dogs made from soy or another meat substitute. If you'd prefer not to use faux meat, you can also batter-fry onion slices, sweet potato wedges, broccoli florets, or pieces of cauliflower.
 For a healthier version of this treat, you can bake them in the oven instead of deep frying them. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Lay the corn dogs on a baking pan lined with parchment paper. Place the pan in the oven and bake the corn dogs for 20 minutes, or until they turn deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven and cool for a few minutes before eating.

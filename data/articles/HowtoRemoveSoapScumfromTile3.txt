 If you prefer an all-natural tile cleaner, add 1 cup of baking soda (180 g) to a bowl. Drizzle in just enough white vinegar to create a thick paste.It’s normal for the mixture to fizz when you combine the ingredients.
 Once the baking soda and vinegar mixture stops fizzing, apply it the dirty tile with a damp sponge. Allow the mixture to sit on the surface for at least 15 minutes so it has time to break down the soap scum.You may want to leave the baking soda paste on the tile for up to a half hour if the soap scum is particularly thick.
 After you’ve allowed the baking soda paste to sit on the tile for at least 15 minutes, wet a clean, non-abrasive sponge and wipe it away. Next, use a spray bottle filled with warm water to thoroughly rinse the tile so it’s completely clean.If there are some areas where the soap scum hasn’t come off, you can scrub them with a soft-bristled brush.
 When the tile is completely clean, use a clean towel or cloth to wipe down the surface. It’s important to dry the tile completely if you want to keep the surface free of soap scum and mildew.

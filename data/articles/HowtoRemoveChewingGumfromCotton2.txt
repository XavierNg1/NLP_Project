 Instead of trying to harden gum by freezing it, you can instead soften it further with heat. This is faster, but a bit more risky, because you can scorch the cotton or overheat the gum and make an even bigger mess.Set the dryer on a medium or low setting, and wave it back and forth so no one spot overheats.
Keep going until the gum appears to be on the verge of melting.
Put gloves on (because the gum may be very hot in spots), and peel the gum away. If sufficiently heated, it should pull away easily.
 If you donâ€™t have a hair dryer, or happen to have your iron out anyway, you can use the latter item to soften and peel away the gum. Once again, though, be careful not to scorch the garment or melt the gum into a puddle of sticky goo.Place a piece of cardboard on your ironing board. Place the garment, gum side down, on top of the cardboard.
Set your iron to medium to prevent scorching or overheating. Run the iron over the back side of the gum spot as you normally would.
Check your progress occasionally. When the gum is sufficiently heated, it should peel right away from the clothing and stick instead to the cardboard.
 The process for removing any remaining stickiness or residue is the same whether you freeze or heat the gum off.Blot, wipe, or lightly scrub away any gum remnants with a color- and fabric-safe spot cleaner or with laundry detergent, then launder as usual.

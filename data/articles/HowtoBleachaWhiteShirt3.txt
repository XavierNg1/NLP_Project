 For this method, you'll use the natural bleaching power of the sun's rays to get your shirt looking as white as possible. Before bleach was commercially available, this was the primary way that people kept their whites bright and shining. To begin, wash your white shirt as you normally would. You can use one of the methods described above or simply use whatever washing technique you're used to.
 Next, if the sun is shining and there's no chance of rain, take your wet clothes outside. Hang the shirt over a horizontal wire or a wooden drying rack. If you don't have either of these things handy, you can try laying it on a clean, flat surface, like the floor of a deck or patio, or hanging it over a railing. Try to position the shirt somewhere will it will get plenty of sun â€” the more, the better.
 Now, all you've got to do is wait! Over time, the sun will do its work, naturally evaporating the moisture trapped in the fabric. As it does this, the sun will also gently bleach the fabric itself, resulting in noticeably whiter whites without the aid of commercial bleach. This method is great for cloth diapers and other sorts of frequently-soiled white fabrics.


The bleaching power of the sun comes from the ultraviolet radiation in its rays. This radiation can actually break up the chemical bonds that produce the colors in stains at a molecular level, causing them to "fade" or lighten in color., While sun-bleaching offers an easy, convenient alternative to commercial bleach, it has its drawbacks as well. Over time, the sun's rays can actually weaken clothing fabric, making it much more susceptible to damage and wear. For this reason, you'll want to avoid leaving clothes out in the sun longer than they need to be. Once your whites have dried, to avoid unnecessary wear, bring them in, rather than letting them sit out.

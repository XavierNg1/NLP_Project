 You probably won’t want to keep going at full speed with a cramp regardless, but slow down your pace when a cramp comes on.The lower impact of the slower pace will immediately reduce the up-and-down tugging and ligament stretching behind the cramp.
 For the same reason that deep breathing can help prevent cramping, it can also help alleviate cramps once they start. Quickly take in a deep breath, which will force down your diaphragm and relieve the stress on the surrounding ligaments.Hold the breath for several seconds, then exhale with force through pursed lips.Repeat several times until the cramp goes away.
 If deep breathing alone doesn’t help alleviate the pain after several seconds, try bending over—which can help you expel each breath more fully—and tightening your abdominal muscles as you do.These combined actions can help reduce the stress on your diaphragm even further to stop the cramping.
 While not particularly helpful during a run away from home, tightening a belt around your waist has also proven helpful in stopping pain related to side stitches.Try this if you have a home treadmill or remember to bring a belt to the gym with you.
 If you don’t have a belt handy, simply try using your hand to firmly grasp the area on your waist below the pain.Side stitches are almost always on one side of the body (typically right) with the pain centered just below the ribcage. As you exhale, pinch this area between your thumb and fingers, and then relax your grip as you inhale.This may not work as effectively as a belt, but combined with deep breathing, it should alleviate the cramp in five or six breaths.

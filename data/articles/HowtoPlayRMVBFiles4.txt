Right-click on the RMVB file and then left-click on "Open."
Choose the option that says "Select the program from a list" in the window that pops up and then hit the OK button.
Select RealPlayer from the list that appears in the Programs list if you want to use RealPlayer to play the RMVB file. Otherwise select VLC media player from this list to open this RMVB file with VLC media player. If you want to use Real Alternative instead you should choose Windows Media Player Classic from the list since that is the media player that supports the Real Alternative plug-in.

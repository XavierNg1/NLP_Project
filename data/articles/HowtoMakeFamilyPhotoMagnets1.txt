, This special type of photo paper is more expensive than photo paper, but it allows you to make photo magnets very quickly. Test a sheet to make sure it works in your printer.
 For uniform sized family photo magnets, choose photos where the faces are approximately the same size.
 You may be able to fit a few different photos on 1 sheet by turning the sheet and feeding it back into the printer. Allow the ink on the magnet paper to dry completely before touching it.
 Stick them on the fridge.


Use your family photo magnets as a game for your infant or toddler. Place the magnets on a low appliance or safe piece of metal. Allow the child to arrange the pictures at their level. Add magnetic letters and numbers to increase the educational content of the activity.

 For an easy, temporary cell phone number, purchase a prepaid cell phone from a phone store, department store, or convenience store. Follow the instructions for activation, which usually involve calling the service provider from a landline or visiting their website.There is no requirement to give the service provider your name or personal information.If you require more airtime than what is provided with the phone, purchase an additional airtime card from the same provider and activate it the same way.
 To get a temporary new number for an unlocked cell phone, purchase a temporary use SIM card. Open up your phone and replace your current SIM card with the new one, and send a text to the number indicated on your card to activate it. Your new number will stay active until you run out of the minutes or data allotted with the card.ZipSIM, for instance, offers temporary use SIM cards starting at $25 for a weekâ€™s worth of calls, texting, and data usage.
Note that temporary SIM cards will only work with an unlocked phone.

 Begin by getting everything you need. Just about everything can be obtained from your local craft store. In addition to what's shown below you'll also need a little bit of stuffing which is usually sold in large quantities.;
, You'll need to make sure everything's the right side or else you'll have a quite crooked mushroom.
 You can leave a small opening and then sew that after adding the stuffing.
 To do this you'll need to use a pin to hold the top and bottom together while you sew around the edges in a circular shape.
 The brown circle will later be sewn around the top however for now you will need to sew a circle around the edges. This will be a great guide for the next step.
 It doesn't have to completely fit the top of your mushroom.
 Remember, this will be your final product so be clean with it.
 You can decorate from here, use a mini-tip felt pen an add a face from here or leave it plain and cute as-is.

 Pour 2 cups of warm water into a saucepan.;
, Mix it well with the water.
 Do not drain the water from the can, but include it in the sauce.
 Finely grate 2 medium carrots or 1 large carrot and add that to the saucepan.
 Dice 1/3 of an onion and add it to the sauce. The type of onion is up to you but red and sweet onions work best.


You can alternatively use 2-3 shallots.
 Add in 1-2 cloves of chopped garlic, 1/2 tsp of celery salt, 1 tsp of dried oregano (or fresh equivalent), 1 tbsp of dried basil (or fresh equivalent), and optionally 1 chicken bouillon cube and/or 1 bay leaf.
 Mix the ingredients well and then bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat.
 Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 15-30 minutes. The longer the simmer, the more the flavors will be drawn out. Remove from heat when done.
 Once the sauce is cooked, if you do not like the consistency, you can make it even smoother by using a blender or a blending wand to get it as smooth as possible.

 After the pasta is almost cooked through, take the lid off the pot and stir the ingredients. Taste the American chop suey and add salt and pepper to taste.The mixture will be very soupy and thin at this point. Don’t worry; it will thicken up shortly.
 Once you’ve seasoned the chop suey, add half of the 1 pound (450 g) low moisture whole milk mozzarella cheese that you’ve cut into 1/2-inch cubes to the pot. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to stir the cheese into the mixture to incorporate quickly.Avoid over stirring the cheese into the American chop suey. That can cause the mozzarella to stretch and stick to the spoon, causing a big mess.
 Spread the rest of the cubed mozzarella over the top of chop suey. Follow up by sprinkling half of the 3 ounces (85 g) of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that’s been roughly grated over the pot as well.Don’t stir the cheeses into the mixture. You want it to form a topping over the dish.
 Place the lid back on the pot, and turn the heat to a low setting. Allow the American chop suey to come to a light simmer and cook for approximately 3 minutes., After the dish has finished cooking, take the pot off the burner. Leave the lid on, but let it rest for another 5 minutes or until the cheese has melted completely over the top of the chop suey.Allowing the dish to rest for a few more minutes gives the pasta an opportunity to soak up any excess liquid in the pot. That helps give the chop suey a thicker consistency and ensures that the macaroni is cooked to al dente.
 Once the dish has rested for several more minutes, remove the lid. Spread the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and the chopped fresh parsley that you set aside earlier over the American chop suey as a garnish and serve hot.When you serve the dish, you should have extra Worcestershire sauce on the table so guests can add more if desired.

 Even if you don’t use makeup every day, there are probably products that you reach for every time you do your makeup. These are likely basic products like your favorite foundation, concealer, eyeliner and mascara. Take these products and put them in their own organizer. You can even just put them in a small tray in front of your organizer for easy access.If you don’t have a separate organizer to use for these products, put them in the front of your organizer so that they are easily accessible.
 Take all your brushes and put them in clear makeup jars or a tall compartment in your makeup organizer. Take any other tools that you use and store them together so you know where they are., When you are doing your makeup, you generally work on one area of your face at a time, so having your makeup organized by eyes, lips and face will make the process of applying makeup easier.Eye shadows in individual packaging are best organized in small, shallow compartments. Put your mascaras and other eye products in a compartment next to your shadows and liners. This way you only have one place to look when you are doing your eye makeup.
Put face products like foundation, concealer, powder, blush and bronzer in the same area in your organizer. Since many of these products are in pans or are free-standing, they work best in wide, shallow containers.
Put all your lip products together. Lipstick is best displayed upright in deep compartments, or laid flat in trays. Also put any products like lipliner or lipgloss next to your lipsticks.
 Now that you have organized your collection, do your best to maintain it. Even if you’re in a hurry, always put your makeup items back in their proper place. This can save you the headache of reorganizing later, and it will make your makeup collection look impeccable!

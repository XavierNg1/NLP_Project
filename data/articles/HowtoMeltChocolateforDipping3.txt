 Any plastic, glass or ceramic bowl or mug will work well.









Don't overfill the dish. You can always melt a little more chocolate if you need it.
If you wish, add a tablespoon of vegetable oil per cup of chocolate pieces. This ensures even melting and helps prevent the chocolate from seizing, but it may affect the taste.
 Microwave it on medium heat in 30-second bursts.









After each 30-second burst, remove the dish from the microwave and stir the chocolate. Be careful, since the dish will get hot.
Repeat until the chocolate is entirely melted.
 It's easiest to dip fruit, cookies and candies directly into the dish, since transferring it to a different dish will cause it to cool faster.

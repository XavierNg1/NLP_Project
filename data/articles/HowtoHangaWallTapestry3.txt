 If your tapestry has no rod pocket then you can simply add one onto the top back edge of your tapestry to hang using the previous methods.









This is an easy way to prepare your tapestry for hanging either with a rod or using a baseboard., You can use heavy cotton, linen or even cotton twill rug binding. These materials will be strong enough to hold up your tapestry.









The strip must be wide enough to be wrapped all the way around your rod lengthwise with a little cloth left over. , Use heavy cotton button-hole thread to hand sew the strip across the tapestry. Catch at least two warp threads (the underlying straight threads) with each stitch so that it is strong enough to support the tapestry.









Use thread that is the same color as a dominant color of your tapestry so that it wonâ€™t be noticeable.
Make sure you sew the strip so that it sticks up along the middle. This will make room for the rod so that your tapestry lies straight when the rod is inserted.
Be very careful that your strip is straight, even if your tapestry does not have a straight edge. If your strip is not sewn straight, the tapestry will hang crooked as well. , You can either use a normal tapestry rod or a baseboard to slide in and hang as normal in the other two methods. Alternatively you can insert a rod that is slightly shorter than the width of the tapestry.









If using a short rod you can hang it on two screws attached to the wall at the ends of the rod. This way you cannot see any hanging apparatus from the front side. , Step back and observe the tapestry to make sure it is hanging straight. If it is not even try taking out the stitches and reattaching the rod pocket or casing.

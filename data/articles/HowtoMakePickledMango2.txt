 Take 2 green mangoes and slice them into long, thin pieces that are bite-sized. This part is really up to you. If you prefer cubed pieces over longer slices, that works too. Whatever you decide, this amazing Hawaiian dish, known as Li Hing Pickled Mango, will suit your tastes.
 Turn off the heat once the water is boiled.
 Stir 2½ cups of light brown sugar and 3 tablespoon (44.4 ml). of Hawaiian salt into the water to dissolve it. If you want to dilute the mixture a bit, you can add a little bit more water.
 Remove the mixture from the heat completely and add 1 cup of rice vinegar to the mix.
 Jade brand powder is a great powder to use; just add 2 tablespoon (29.6 ml). of the Li Hing powder to the mix and stir it in to combine the ingredients. You can add a bit more to taste if you like. Add a few drops of food coloring until the color is a deep red. Though adding food coloring is optional, it can really make this dish pop and look fantastic. Stir all of the ingredients together until they are fully incorporated.
 Once you've made and stirred the juice, place it in the fridge for an hour, or the freezer for half an hour or so.
 Place the mango pieces in a jar, packing it as tightly as possible.
 Then, remove the cooled juice from the fridge and pour it into the jar, over the pieces of mango. Fill the jar all the way to the top and make sure that you cover it tightly.
 This is how long it will take for the mangoes to fully absorb the juice.
 Once you've made this delicious treat, you can enjoy this pickled mango on its own, with other fruits, or with rice.

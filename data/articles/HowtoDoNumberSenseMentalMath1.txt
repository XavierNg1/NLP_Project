Round the number (to be added) up to the next highest multiple of ten.
Add to the other number.
Subtract the amount rounded up.

Example 88 + 56 = ? ; Round 88 up to 90.
Add 90 to 56 = 146
Subtract the two added to 88 (to round up to 90).
146 - 2 = 144 ; the answer!
This process is simple reframing of the problem as 56 + (90 -2 ). Examples of other usages of this technique: 99 = (100 - 1); 68 = (70 - 2)
You can use a similar reframing technique for subtraction, too.

;
, Multiplication is addition of multiple occurrences of the same number.


Note how many times a number to be added is repeated.

For example:
7 + 25 + 7 +7 +7 =
becomes 25 + (4 × 7) =
25 + 28 = 53



, Additive opposites can be +7 - 7.
Additive opposites can also be 5 - 2 + 4 - 7.


Look for numbers that add or subtract for a total of 0. Using the example above: (NOTE: The picture above is wrong. It shows 5 + 9 = 9 <--> -2 -7 = 9 when it should be 5 + 4 = 9 <--> -2 -7 = -9)
5 + 4 = 9 is the additive opposite of -2 -7 = -9
Since they are additive opposites, no actual addition of all four numbers is needed; the answer is 0 (zero) by cancelling.

Try this:
4 + 5 - 7 + 8 - 3 + 6 - 9 + 2 =
becomes:(4 + 5) - 9 + ( -7 - 3) + (8 + 2) + 6 = By grouping
and remember, don't add them; just remove additive opposites from the problem.
0 + 0 + 6 = 6

 If you know, as a young student, that you will want to take calculus, either in high school or later in college, you should start with your class schedule. Tell your guidance counselor that you want to get into calculus and map out a schedule that will do this for you. You will need to take at least the basic preliminary classes of Algebra (sometimes taught in one or two years), Geometry, and Trigonometry (sometimes labeled as “Pre-Calculus”).

If your school offers different academic levels of math classes, such as basic, standard, honors, or so on, you should try to get into the highest level that you can.

, Many students begin learning the basics of algebra in seventh or eighth grade. Some even begin getting some basic principles earlier than that. You need to work hard in these classes. Math is a subject that builds one class on another. If you have trouble with the basics that begin in algebra, you are likely to have even more difficulty later in calculus. In particular, here are some of the skills that you should develop:

Manipulation of equations

Quadratic equations

Powers and roots


, In most math programs, the subject that comes just before calculus is trigonometry. Trigonometry is based on the ratios of the sides of right triangles, particularly in connection with the unit circle. Trigonometric functions relate very well to describing motion, and calculus is based on measuring rates of change. Therefore, trigonometry is a key building block of calculus. In particular, you need to learn the following topics very thoroughly:Basic trigonometry functions: sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, cotangent

Inverse trigonometry functions: arcsine, arccosine, arctangent

Know substitute functions. A lot of trigonometry is based on substituting one function for another. You will need to be able to use these substitutions quickly and easily to do well in calculus.

Double angles like sin⁡2θ{\displaystyle \sin 2\theta }

Half angles, like sin2θ2{\displaystyle \sin ^{2}{\frac {\theta }{2}}}

Addition formulas, such as cos⁡(x+y){\displaystyle \cos(x+y)}




, Exponents and logarithms are key to manipulating equations and functions in calculus. These topics generally arise initially in algebra and pre-calculus classes. Exponents and logarithms are inverse operations of each other, and are key to many operations in calculus. You need to study these carefully. Go back and review these topics before your calculus class, if necessary.

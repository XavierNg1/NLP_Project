 The jar should be filled at least halfway with vinegar.


White vinegar can also be used, but apple cider vinegar tends to work better at attracting gnats due to the mild apple aroma.
Similarly, you can prepare a mixture made from 2 Tbsp (30 ml) cider vinegar, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) sugar, a couple drops of dish soap, and 1 quart (1 liter) of water. This can be used instead of straight vinegar.
You can use any container with a wide mouth. A jar is generally a good choice, but a cup, bowl, or similar container would also work.
 Make sure that the plastic wrap is securely fixed onto the top of the jar.


If necessary, wrap a rubber band around the mouth of the jar and over the ends of the plastic wrap to hold the wrap in place.
The plastic wrap should be taut across the mouth of the jar.
 Use a fork or toothpick to create several small holes in the plastic wrap.


The smell of the vinegar will attract the gnats, causing them to fly into the jar. Once inside, the gnats will be trapped.
 Place one of these jars in every area where gnats swarm.


Add more vinegar to the jar every two to four days. The smell of fresh vinegar attracts gnats better than that of vinegar sitting out for several days.
Empty out the jars as necessary. As the jars fill up with dead gnats, you may need to dump the contents, wash, and refill.

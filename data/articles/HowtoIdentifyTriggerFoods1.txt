 Are you eating because you’re hungry, emotional or having a craving? A trigger food is a food that you eat for no reason at all, but you cannot seem to stop eating it. Once you start eating a trigger food, you will continue to eat far past the point of fullness (e.g., eating Doritos and not being able to stop until the bag is near empty or empty, and then consuming an ice cream bar immediately afterward).;
, Once you know why you are eating, you can begin to identify trigger foods. These foods generally contain high amounts of sugar, fat and/or salt. When you notice you are eating a food that can be classified as a trigger food for you, write it down so you can keep track of what they are. Then make sure that you don’t add them to your next grocery list.
 Not only can a specific food trigger you to eat uncontrollably. Pay attention to whether there are certain places that stimulate you to eat more than your body would comfortably want to ingest. For example, when you go to a movie theatre, do you find it difficult not to have popcorn or boxed candy? When you go out to your favorite restaurant, do you automatically skip over ordering a salad and order something fried instead? Once you identify your trigger food locations, you can be more aware of your behavior and make conscious choices about whether you want to put yourself in compromising eating situations to begin with. This doesn’t mean that you can never eat out, but it does teach you to make healthy lifestyle choices, even when you don’t have complete control over what you eat.
 Once you have identified the foods that trigger you to eat excessively, removing them from your life is the best way to avoid them. You may notice that once you have avoided certain foods for a period of time, they no longer affect you the same way and your weight loss efforts will show results.

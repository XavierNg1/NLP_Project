 It doesn't need to be expensive—a generic brand should suffice. Find a shower cream anywhere that sells cleaning supplies: home-and-garden stores, bathroom-supply stores, and some drugstores.
 Don't worry about ruining the surface—the cream doesn't harm glass. Rub the cream all over the glass, and don't feel that you need to rub too hard.


If you have a marble shower, you should keep the cleaning cream away from the marble.
 The cream will froth, and it might take a few attempts to wipe it all off—but you don't need to scrub!

, Use a clean, dry towel (cloth or paper) to gently dry the shower screen so that the end result is evenly clean.
 If you're worried about the surface of your tiles, you can put the cream onto a cloth instead, but it will take longer and more persistence.

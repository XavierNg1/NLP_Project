 To begin, squeeze a small amount of moisturizer into your hand or a small container. If possible, use moisturizer that is non-comedogenic: that will not cake onto your skin and create acne.Some moisturizer products will cake onto your skin and clog your pores, creating an ideal environment for acne. If you tend to get acne, then a non-comedogenic moisturizer might truly be a wiser choice.;
, If you don't have the exact color, add lighter and darker powder until you have a mixture that is thick and opaque enough to serve as a concealer.
 You may need to go through a bit of trial and error to get the proportions right.









Alternatively, look for tinted moisturizer. You may be able to find a moisturizer product that matches your skin tone, which will remove the need to color the concealer.
 Use the homemade concealer in the same way that you would a store-bought product. Don the concealer into the spot that you want to cover up, and feel free to use more if the first dollop isn't enough. Use your finger or a brush. You may find that a small, clean concealer brush affords you a bit more precision and yields better results than just a finger. It's also more sanitary.

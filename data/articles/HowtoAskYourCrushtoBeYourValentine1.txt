 You can go all out and make something elaborate, or you can keep it simple – it’s up to you! It’s what you say in the card that matters. If you aren’t very artistic, get a piece of red construction paper, fold it in half and use that as your card. You can also draw, paint, or even make a collage on it. Get creative!


If you know your crush likes a certain animal or activity, you can draw or make a collage based on that.
Your card doesn’t have to be handmade, although your crush might find it particularly sweet if it is.;
, You can write a long note anytime, but if you just want to ask your sweetie to be your valentine, write something simple in your card. You could say “Would you be…” on the front of the card, then write “…my valentine?” on the inside. For a little something extra, you could write a compliment like “You look nice today.”


You could also write “Just wanted to know…” on the outside and on the inside say, “Will you be my valentine?”

, If you want your crush to know it’s you right away, sign your name on the inside. To be a little more mysterious, sign the card as “Your Secret Admirer” or “Your Hopeful Valentine.” You don’t have to write “Love” or anything serious like that if you don’t want to! You could put “xo” which means “hugs and kisses.”


For example, you could write: “Dear Helen, Will you be my Valentine? If yes, please meet me at the park at 4:00. xoxo, Jane.”

, If you’re feeling brave, you can always walk right up to your crush and hand them the card. However, it's pretty normal to feel shy about it, so you don't have to do it that way. You can always leave the note somewhere they’ll be sure to find it.


For example, you could put it in their locker, slip it in their backpack when they aren’t looking, or put it in one of their text books.
For an extra special touch, you can leave a single flower with the note. Roses are popular, but you don’t have to be that traditional.

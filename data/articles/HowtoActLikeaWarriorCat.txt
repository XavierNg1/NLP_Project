 Your cat can be blue (like Bluestar), Tortoiseshell (like Spottedleaf), or even just white with black paws (like Blackstar). Your coat can look like anything! Remember your cat's pelt color, eye color, any markings (such as tabby or calico), and his or her battle scars. Examples are:


Dapplefur- dappled tortie with a white muzzle and amber eyes.
Blueflower- blue-gray with a nick in her ear and green eyes.
Snowstorm- white with yellow eyes and feathered ears.;
, Your eyes can be blue, green, orange, amber, yellow or even violet! But also make reasons why this particular cat has 'unique' pelt colors or weird eye colors. Try to be realistic!

, Shy? Rude? Bossy? Remember, try to avoid a Mary-Sue! (That means don't make your cat perfect. It will impact the story negatively.)

, For example, Nightflower was born to Jayfrost and Willowtail in a bitter leaf-bare. Jayfrost died soon after her birth. As an apprentice, she excelled at hunting and was an ace in speed and agility. She became a warrior at an unusually young age, and so forth.
 You can be WindClan, RiverClan, ShadowClan, ThunderClan, SkyClan, BloodClan, or even StarClan. Or you can try to make a clan like SunClan, BoneClan, FrostClan, etc. But you may choose whatever you like!

, You can be a kit, apprentice, warrior, elder, queen, medicine cat, deputy, or leader. Maybe even a rogue, loner, or kittypet!

, You can make your name based on your rank, or you can make a random warrior name like Back scratch or something like that. You can go on warriorcats.com and type in your name and hometown to get an individual name, or you can try The Erin Hunter way, by having one list of the first part of a name (Jay, Bark, Spotted,etc.), and one with the second half (paw, claw, feather, etc.). Don't make unrealistic names; like Electricbook or simply strange ones like Fireflame. Keep it realistic, that's what makes a good clan cat!

, Stick to nature, but don't call your Clan NatureClan. Also, names like CookieClan, NetflixClan and WiiClan aren't good, because cats don't know what Netflix is. Names like DawnClan, IceClan, FireClan, and SunClan are just a few ideal ones.
 It can be anything, although it should relate to your clan's name and/or abilities. The territory for DustClan, for example, can be dusty and desert-like with dust storms. OakClan territory can be dense forest and undergrowth.
 Make up a leader first, followed by a medicine cat and five to ten warriors. When you start to get comfortable, make apprentices and elders. Queens and kits are a good idea, but they're optional. Finally, choose a loyal and dedicated warrior to be the deputy.


If playing with friends, let them develop their own characters as wished. If there is a struggle over who is leader, etc., throw a coin for it, or take turns at different stages of your games.
 You must have a full clan to have things like meetings, patrols, training, etc. But you could also gather friends from different clans, so you can battle and have gatherings. This is probably the most important part of being a warrior, because the warrior code is for all four of the clans, which you must follow.


To make it even more fun, ask a couple of friends to join your clan and assign apprentices to any warriors. You could show them hunting or battle skills!

, Have a warrior ceremony for them to make it even more realistic!


If there is more than one clan you are dealing with, have a battle sometimes. It would show, if you taught an apprentice battle moves, how well they are coming along with their training!

, You will be able to feed information to another cat or get information from leaders. Remember, don't spill too much.
 This doesn't mean you have to walk around on all fours but behave a bit catlike. Climb trees, eat lots of meat, "hunt", and, if you want, have a signature scent with your perfume or cologne.
 Warriors live in the forest, so your backyard is a decent substitute. Shallow out a small nest in the bushes. Place specific flowers and plants in a medicine cat den. Doing this may show that you are really dedicated to your clan yard.

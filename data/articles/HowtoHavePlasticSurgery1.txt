 What about your appearance are you unhappy with? Is your nose too big? Is your chin too small? Does your face look flat? Is your hairline receding? Choose which procedure you are interested in and start researching on the internet.;
, Get a general idea of the expected costs, procedure details, what type of anesthesia you will need, and how much downtime to expect after you have the surgery. Look up before and after photos on the internet.
 If you don't know where to begin, go to Google maps and type in "plastic surgeons in my area". This will list nearly every single plastic surgeon near you with a map and directions. First impressions say a lot. Do you like the doctors website? Look for a surgeon who is double or triple board certified. Usually, if a surgeon has these credentials, they will be stated on the website, at the bottom.


A good way to find a plastic surgeon is from asking people you know. If someone you know had the surgery you want, asked who they used and if they are happy. That way you can be sure you're using a reputable person.
 Although you aren't a doctor and will not be able to determine alone if this is the right procedure for you, you can look into potential side effects and alternatives to help make an educated decision.

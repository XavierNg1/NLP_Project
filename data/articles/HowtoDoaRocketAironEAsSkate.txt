 The Rocket Air requires a lot of time to pull off, so you'll want to make sure you get some good air before you attempt it. You can do a Rocket Air off of a vert or by doing an ollie (jump) over a gap.


To do an ollie, pull the stick towards you to crouch, and then flip it up when you want to ollie. Hold your crouch longer while going down a slope to get more air.;
, This will begin the move by kicking the board out.
 A Rocket Air involves grabbing the top of your board with both hands. You'll need to start the grab one hand at a time, and the starting hand varies depending on your stance.Press and hold the grab button:


Regular:  LT (Xbox 360) / L2 (PS3)
Goofy:  RT (Xbox 360) / R2 (PS3)

, Immediately after starting to grab with your first hand, press and hold the grab button for the other hand. This will complete the Rocket Air.Regular:  RT (Xbox 360) / R2 (PS3)
Goofy:  LT (Xbox 360) / L2 (PS3)

, Hold both grab buttons for as long as you can to maximize your points for the trick. You'll be able to hold the trick longer if you get really big air before starting the trick. If you want to increase your points, you can use the left stick to spin around while you're in the air. Be careful when doing this though, as it makes landing much trickier.
 If you launched off of a vert, you'll come straight back down and take off in the opposite stance. If you ollied over a gap, make sure that your board is lined up for the landing.
 It takes about a second to get back to your board after releasing the Rocket Air buttons. Make sure to give yourself enough time to safely get back to your board so that you don't wipe out when you hit the ground.

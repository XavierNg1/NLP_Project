 If they are Christian/s also, they should be able to help you. Ask them the following questions:


Were you a Christian when you were my age?
Are there any Christian stories you can tell me? (Bible stories, stories that helped them in their faith when they were children, etc.);
, You should not have to change your faith because of your parents' beliefs, but it may be helpful for you to find a Christian adult to answer any questions you may have, and mentor you in your walk with Christ.
 You can borrow one from the library, or, if you have a Kindle E-Reader you can get one for free on Amazon, sent straight to your e-reader. Many churches and religious organizations give paper Bibles away for free, and you can even read and search the Bible on the Internet.
 Swearing is not proper behavior for Christians. Every time you hear the word swear, replace it with curse so that you can realise the severity of it.
 If you have already seen porn, you should realize that sex is not really like what you've seen. God created intercourse for married couples to show love to each other, not to jump into bed the moment they meet. Block all of these sites on your computer, phone, and other devices. If you have a problem with porn, try rewarding yourself each day you go without watching it with something like a piece of candy.
 Hug them and give them a day off from chores once in a while. Remember, if it wasn't for your parents, you wouldn't be alive or even here. So, thank them with all your heart.
 Help them and never tell their secrets. Whenever they're down, cheer them up; think of you as their map. If they're ascending the wrong hill, you get them up the right one. But *don't* be controlling.

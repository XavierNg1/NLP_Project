 You need to be responsible to show it so here are some things you can do to be helpful:


Clean the house even when not asked and keep it clean!
If your little sibling needs help with homework or wants to play, spend time with him/her. This shows you are willing to spend time with your new puppy.
If you have a baby sibling, help potty train him/her. Your parents will be proud due to the fact that it is required when having a puppy.;
, Show your parents a slideshow or preview of the dog breed you want. State all the positives and all the negatives! Also, sign a contract to show all of the responsibilities you will take on to care for your puppy. Let your parents decide if the breed you have chosen is the right one. If you totally disagree, then show them a video such as Dogs 101 ex. let your parents choose a consequence if you disobey your contract such as no electronics for a week, no play dates for two days, etc.
 Stop being cooped up and go outside and breathe fresh air. especially because you will need to do it often with your new puppy at the least three times a week. Your parents will know you are willing to break time off TV to spend time with you dog.
 If your parents think you are old enough to get a small job, it's a great way to make money. However if not, helping around the house will do the trick. Help clean, Clear out the yard, maybe even dog sit for a friend! This shows you are willing to help get ready for your dog with helping to pay for the following supplies: leash, collar, toys, two bowls- water, food, dental care- toothbrush/toothpaste, oral-pup, grooming tools- brush, comb, bristle brush, hairdryer.

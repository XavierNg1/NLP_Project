 For all the materials that you'll need, check the things you'll need. (below)

, This will help you get a good idea on what you'll need to draw in the background and in the foreground.
 Start by draw a random shape. It can be anything. A circle, square, ETC. Also you'll need to brainstorm how the character is going to feel. Try making expressions into the mirror and then copying them down. You can also act out what your cartoon character is going to do. Try picturing how he/she/it looks like. *If you need too, you can look at drawings you find in magazines, books, poster, and the internet, but DO NOT copy them! You'll get into a copy writing mess!

, All you need to do to practice this is to draw scenes without characters. draw objects that you'll need or don't need.
 To do this draw a couple panels with a straightedge. (at best try a ruler)

, Just remember, draw outlines first, THEN color with colored pencils, markers, crayons, paint, glitter, etc. You might want to draw how big you're making the cartoon; such as " 11' 4', 3' 5', etc.
 You can tape it, glue it, staple it, ETC. anywhere you want!

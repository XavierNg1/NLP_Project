 Make sure that there are quite a few blank pages because you have to plan everything very precisely for a perfect day.
 Beforehand, make sure you have checked all bus routes, train railways and times, depending how you are travelling. It is a good idea to write these routes/times down and keep them with you in case you get lost or lose track of time.,Â A budget is important because when you don't have one, you don't realize how much money you're spending until you get home., You may want to buy clothes and if so, you need to try them on. Skinny jeans and tight tops are the worst thing that you could wear. Light clothes are recommended., If you're over budget when you want to by something on your 'want' list, then it's obviously not worth the money. On the other hand, if it's on your 'need' list then it's something you need and can't live without., This would be sensible because you can put all of your items in there.

Keep an energy bar or similar snack in your bag, to help restore your energy levels quickly. A bottle of water is also helpful, to slake your thirst as needed.

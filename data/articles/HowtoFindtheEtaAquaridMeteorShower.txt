 The best viewing time is 5-6 May each year.Although Comet Halley won't be visiting Earth until 2061, this meteor shower is courtesy of the Earth passing through its debris cloud.The best viewing time is in the hour or two before dawn.This means around 3:00am to 5:30am.
The Eta (η) Aquarid meteor shower is active from 19th April through to 28th May, but activity is considerably lessened either side of the peak time.;
, You will need to get away from city and town lights and go to a suitable viewing place, preferably higher up (a hill is good). While it is possible to see the showers in both hemispheres, the further south you're located, the more likely you are to see of the meteors.The closer you are to the equator, the better.The naked eye is best for seeing meteors, so don't worry about a telescope or binoculars.
Prepare well for your stargazing, especially by dressing warmly and having something comfortable to recline on. See How to stargaze the relaxed way for tips on equipping yourself for the cooler night air.
 The meteors appear to be coming from a point near the star Eta (η) Aquarii in the constellation Aquarius.However, if you look in that direction, the meteors may well seem stub-like because their tails trail back toward the radiant. For the best chances, keep an eye on the sky generally and in particular eastward, as meteors can appear anywhere in the sky.Expect their trails to point back to the Aquarius constellation.


Expect to be able to see around 30 meteors an hour, with up to twice as many obvious in the southern latitudes.They will be fast-moving (66km a second or 148,000 miles per hour).

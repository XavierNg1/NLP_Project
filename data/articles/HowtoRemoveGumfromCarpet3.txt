 These solvents will help dissolve the gum polymers making them less sticky and easier to remove from the carpet. Use a cleaning cloth to directly apply the solvent to the gum wad. A muscle rub product containing methyl salicylate can also be used as a solvent.









Always test a small amount of solvent on a hidden area of your carpet to ensure that no staining will result from using the solvent to remove gum.
 Wait 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the hardness of the gum, before attempting to remove the gum. During this time the solvents will work their way into the gum polymers and loosen the structures thereby releasing the gum from the carpet., Use a scraping motion in the same direction with each pass to avoid damaging the carpet fibers.
 Finish the cleaning process by removing any traces of the solvents with soap and water. Blot dry with a towel, and enjoy your gum free carpets.

 For everyone you'd like to reach on Skype from the Netherlands, have their Skype account information saved on your account ahead of time. Hopefully these are people you've contacted before so it may be saved already.
 In your list of Skype contacts, find the person you wish to reach and double-click on their name in the list. Their profile should show be expanded in a new window.
 The button is a blue circle with a white silhouette of a telephone handset inside. Click this button to initiate the call.


Note, if this is someone you don't have listed as a contact, you'll see a green circle with a "plus" inside. Press this to add them as a contact; you'll need to wait for them to do the same to begin speaking.
 The Skype call should ring as it awaits receipt on the other end. Provided your contact is ready and waiting, they should answer quickly. Continuing is as simple as starting to talk. If their computer has a camera, you will probably see their image.

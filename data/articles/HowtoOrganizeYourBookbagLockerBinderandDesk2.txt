 This is so you won't have to take up as much space. Take out any other junk in your binder.
 Separate subjects using tabs. Get the tabs with two sides- use one for your homework and one to put extras/notes in. Keep your planner and paper in it.
 Add stickers, song lyrics, and anything else that makes you feel confident and cool!

 Make sure that the frosting is chilled, firm, and smooth. If you are just practicing, you can use a scrap of parchment paper or wax paper instead.
 Insert a star shaped tip into your piping bag, such as the Wilton 195 or 363. Fill the piping bag with a medium-consistency buttercream frosting.This method will create a very simple tulip, shapes sort of like the top part of a fleur de lis., The center petal is a simple, vertical line that is fatter at the bottom and thinner at the top. You can create this by applying more pressure when you start, and hardly any pressure when you finish. How tall you make the tulip is up to you., The left petal starts at the base of the center one and angles to the left, curing at the tip. Place your piping bag at the base of the center petal, and pipe to the left. Once you reach leave the petal, start piping upwards, at a slight angle. When you reach the tip, whisk your tip to the left., The right petal is exactly the same as the left one, except that it angles to the right. Place your tip on the base of the tulip, so that it overlaps the first to petals. Start piping to the right. When you leave the center petal, start piping upwards at a slight angle to the right. When you reach the tip, whisk your bag to the right.

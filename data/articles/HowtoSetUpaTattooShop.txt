 This program can take you 12 to 24 months to complete, but it could also be very expensive. You will gain the experience you need to become a tattoo artist, which can come in handy because you typically need to have experience in a hands-on program before you can start your own tattoo business. You won't be tattooing right away, but the program is vital to your experience.;
, Set up a tattoo shop in a place where there is a lot of automotive and pedestrian traffic to help increase your potential for walk-ins. When people can see your business from the road or as they are walking past, they may be more likely to remember it and visit later.
 The requirements for starting a tattoo business will vary based on where you want to run it. There are health and safety concerns with the art of tattooing, and you will likely be subject to inspections. You also may need to have special permits to operate.


Your local health department can help you determine what licensing is needed for tattooing.
 You won't need to buy everything at once, and you don't have to buy everything brand new. Look in classified papers and online to find used equipment. You will need things such as a tattoo gun, needles, ink, transfers, furniture for the lobby, and a cash register.
 You can advertise online through paid campaigns and a business website or through social media. You can advertise locally with business cards and flyers. If your budget allows, you can also try radio or TV advertising.

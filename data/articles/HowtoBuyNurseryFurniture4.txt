 If you have room in the nursery, you should purchase a changing table that offers a barrier on all sides. Your changing table should also include a latching belt to hold the baby in place., If at all possible, you should test out a changing table in the store before deciding on a model to purchase. Consider your height alongside that of the table. You should also check that any cabinets or drawers are easy to access and completely functional., If the changing table you purchase comes with a changing pad, this is the pad you should use. It will likely be customized to work with that specific changing table as opposed to a pad you might buy separately.

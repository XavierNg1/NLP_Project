 Having a big, long net will be the easiest way to catch a gecko, as it allows you to capture the gecko from the greatest distance.Hover the net slightly above the gecko.
Try to center the net's rim around the spot the gecko is standing.
Drop the net as quickly as possible. Hold the rim of the net down against the ground or wall to contain the gecko, once you've trapped it.
 Wear thick gloves if you're unsure whether the gecko might bite.Cup your hands together, creating a hollow tube with your hands.
Hover your hands slightly above the gecko.
Drop your cupped hands down over the gecko. Be sure that the gecko won't be able to climb out of your hands. Keep the bottoms of your hands flat against the ground, and your fingers tightly knit.
 You can use a stick to gently "guide" a gecko in the direction you want it to go.


Slowly lower the stick slightly behind the gecko.
When the gecko moves, continue to "herd" the gecko in the direction you want it to go.

Be careful not to harm the gecko. You should never actually touch the lizard with the stick. It should simply be used to guide the gecko toward a net or a second person with open hands.

 Slice fruit together to get combos. When you get a combo (slicing more than 2 fruits at the same time) you get extra points. Example: You slice 4 fruit at the same time, You get 4 extra points! If you slice 6 at the same time, you get 6 extra points.;
, If you slice enough combos, you'll get one of those, gaining extra points. but with more points. Different Blitz: Combo Blitz: 5 points plus combos. Received after 3 combos in a row. Great Blitz: 10 points plus combos. Received after 6 combos in a row. Awesome Blitz: 15 points plus combos. Received after 9 combos in a row. Super Blitz: 20 points plus combos. Receive after 12 combos in a row. Hyper Blitz: Get 25 extra points plus combos. Receive after 15 combos in a row. Unbelievable Blitz: 30 extra points plus combos. Receive after 18 combos in a row. If you get more combos after the Unbelievable Blitz, you will keep receiving it every 3 nonstop combos until you stop hitting nonstop combos.
 Frenzies will bring you nonstop fruit without bombs for a short period of time, freeze will freeze your time and make your fruit go slow motion (great for hitting combos!) for a short period of time, and double points will double your points (including extras from combos and blitz.)

, Bombs in Arcade Mode are different than Classic. Instead of ending your game, they take away 10 points, and stop any blitz you were in. Hitting 3 bombs will make you receive the "Bomb Lover" award in the bonuses in the end of the game (worth 50 points!)

, At the end of the game, they give you 3 bonuses. You can get many different ones, and even if you meet the criteria for more than 3, they will only give you 3. If you get less than 3, they will give you an award like "Juicy Slicing" or "Fruit Salad". Avoid these, as they only bring you 5 points each. Try to get ones like "Impossible 9 Fruit Combo" or "Combo God!" They bring you 50 points each. Look up more bonuses and aim for them!

, Happy slicing!

 Once your cat is home from surgery, alternating hot and cold packs on your cats joints can give it some relief. Place a heat pack on the affected joints for 10 minutes. Swap it out for a cold pack and leave that on for the same amount of time. You can do this up to a couple of times a day.Your cat might not be willing to sit still while you do this. Try holding your cat in your arms while you hold the packs to its affected limbs. Petting it and speaking to it in a soothing voice while you do so can help calm down your cat.
 While your cat heals, it’s important it doesn’t move more than it needs to. Place its food, water, and litter box near where it's resting. You should also prevent your cat from running and playing as much as possible., The type of antibiotic you give your cat depends on the results of the bacterial culture your vet takes. Any other conditions, illnesses, and medications will also affect the type of antibiotic your vet prescribes. You should give them to your cat for four to eight weeks, even after their symptoms disappear.

 Please see How to Slaughter Cattle for steps on how you can humanely and properly slaughter your cattle.;
, After the carcass has been hung for a few days to a few weeks, it is time to cut the carcass halves up into different pieces.


Make sure you have the proper equipment, knives sharpened, and clean clothes and an apron before you begin.
 Cut between the 12th and 13th rib, first slicing with a large pointed knife and then cutting the top from the bottom with a meat saw. This cross-section of the cut should look like a rib eye steak.
 Or, set both halves on a table at a comfortable level. Begin cutting the meat at the hind end of the carcass.
 You will begin at the hip and move down to the tailbone. Cut across the top to create round steaks, or cut larger portions for roasts.


The meatiest end of the leg is the rump roast. Cut it away from the bone or leave the bone in when you remove it.
 This is the muscle to the side of the belly portion. Trim away any large amounts of fat. Set your flank steaks on a table and save your fat in a pile to use for pure rendered fat, if you choose.
 Remove the fat with a sharp knife and cut into sirloin steaks of any size. You can also cut this flat meat into pieces for fajitas or tri-tip steak meat.
 You can leave it intact or cut it into smaller steaks.
 You can also choose to use the area between the 6th and 12th ribs for a large prime rib roast.
 They are sirloin, porterhouse, T-bone and New York strip.
, Lift the leg up and cut beneath the shoulder blade until the leg comes loose from the body.
 This is called a blade roast.
 This is called chuck. It can be used as a roast or steaks with the bone in or out. The lower portion of meat should be used for ground beef or steaks.
 This is your brisket.

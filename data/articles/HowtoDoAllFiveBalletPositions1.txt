 Your heels should make a "V" shape. Make sure to focus on rotating your hips out. However, if you have hyperextended legs you can open your ankles to a couple of centimeters apart if your knees touch. If you demi-plie in 1st, you should make sure you are not rolling forward over your feet. This will lead to severe injuries.;
, Your arms should make a circle, and they should rest about 3 inches (7.6Â cm) away from your body.


Tuck your thumbs in and keep your fingers and arms long.

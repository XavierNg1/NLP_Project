 Transition metals can be found in the middle of the periodic tables. They get their name because their oxidation numbers, or their charges, are constantly changing. Let's say you're working with this compound: Fe2O3., You know that the metal will have a positive charge, so cross over the 3 from the O3 and write that Fe has a charge of +3. (For fun, do the reverse and write that O has a charge of -2.) Sometimes, the charge will be provided for you., Since you know that Fe is iron and that it has a charge of +3, you can call it Iron (III). Remember to only use the Roman numeral when you're writing out the name, not writing the formula.
 Since you know that O is oxygen, you can call add the "-ide" ending and call it "oxide."

, Now you have it. Fe2O3 = Iron (III) oxide.
 Under the older naming method, which is also used, you use "-ous" and "-ic" endings for the metals instead of the Roman numerals. If the metal ion has a lower oxidation state (a lower numerical charge, disregarding the "+" or "-"), then you add the "-ous" ending. If it has a higher charge, then it has an "-ic" ending. Fe2+ has the lower state (Fe3+ has the higher state), so it becomes ferrous. The name of Fe2+O can also be written as ferrous oxide.
 There are two transition metals that do have a definite charge. Those are zinc (Zn) and silver (Ag). This means that you don't have to use Roman numerals or the older naming method in describing those elements.

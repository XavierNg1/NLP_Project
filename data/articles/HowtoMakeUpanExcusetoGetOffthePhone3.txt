 Change the topic to get them away from their lengthy discussion. Then, bring the call to a natural close.
 Instead of beating around the bush, actually end the call. Here are some ways:


"Well, thanks for the call. I have to go now." Do not say why!
"What a great conversation we've had! I've enjoyed hearing what you've been doing. I must go now." Again, no need to explain yourself.
"It's wonderful talking to you but I'm pressed for time right now. I'll look forward to talking to you again soon."

, Bear with a bit of up front brusqueness for longer term honesty between you. If people know you as someone who hates talking for a long time on the phone, they'll be more aware to keep the conversation short; and if they don't, they're already forewarned when you end it brusquely that you've reached your fill.

 When interacting with your cat on a regular basis, pay attention to how it meows and how often. It may be that your cat is less vocal than usual and that is how you discover it is hoarse.

Some cats are more vocal than others, so when they stop meowing it is very noticeable.
 When your cat becomes hoarse, it will have a hard time meowing or making other vocalizations. Take the time to listen to your cat closely for meows that sound strange and unusual.

While the sound of a cat's meow can change over its lifetime, the changes associated with aging are very different from those related to disease.
 If your cat has a hoarse voice, you should look for other symptoms of health problems. This will help you assess the seriousness of your cat's condition. If your cat has any of these symptoms, it could signal a serious health problem that needs veterinary care:Weight loss
Digestive problems
Abnormal growths or skin conditions
Lethargy
Trouble breathing
Discharge from the nose or mouth
Sneezing or coughing

 The conversion to Kelvin is remarkably easy-- all it takes is some simple addition. The following three examples will be used throughout the section:

 30℃

 0℃

100℃;
, For example, 30 plus 273.15 is 303.15. This is all you need to do to make your conversion. Just add 273.15 and you're done.

 30+273.15=303.15{\displaystyle 30+273.15=303.15}

 0+273.15=273.15{\displaystyle 0+273.15=273.15}

 100+273.15=373.15{\displaystyle 100+273.15=373.15}, Once you've made your calculation, simply add a K and call it a day.

 30+273.15={\displaystyle 30+273.15=}303.15K{\displaystyle 303.15K}

 0+273.15={\displaystyle 0+273.15=}273.15K{\displaystyle 273.15K}

 100+273.15={\displaystyle 100+273.15=}373.15K{\displaystyle 373.15K}, The correct way to say "292 K" is simply "two-hundred and ninety-two Kelvin." Kelvin is known as the "absolute temperature," and does not use degrees.Each unit is actually called "a Kelvin." It doesn't get two degrees hotter, but two Kelvins hotter.
 Absolute zero, or 0 K, is the point where molecules theoretically stop moving. This is the "perfect" cold. While absolute zero is not possible to create, scientists have come close. The point of the Kelvin scale is to make this sort of calculation -- absolute zero -- easier to work with., Because 0 K is the lowest temperature possible in the universe, Kelvin has no negative numbers. This makes it much, much easier to work with mathematically. You can better compare temperatures, find differences or averages, and note relationships when you don't have to work with positive and negative temperatures.

Kelvin is also used to measure color temperature -- thus the 3000K, 6000K, etc. settings on cameras and professional lighting kits and bulbs., The Kelvin is defined as 1273.15{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{273.15}}} the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water. Accordingly, the number 273.15 is frequently used to convert temperatures to Kelvin. Don't worry if this explanation doesn't make much sense -- it is mostly for high-level chemists and physicists., You cannot go directly from Fahrenheit to Kelvin without converting to Celsius first. The Celsius to Kelvin conversion is much easier than the Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion. You will almost definitely need a calculator for this.86℉


, For example, 86 minus 32 is 54. As an interesting aside, know that this is because the freezing point of Celsius is 32 less than Fahrenheit.86−32=54{\displaystyle 86-32=54}

 Multiply the number you just calculated by 59{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{9}}}, or 0.5555.. For example, 54 times 0.5555 is 30. In some formulas, you may also be asked to divide by 1.8, which is the same calculation as multiplying by 0.5555. This finishes the conversion to Celsius.


54∗.5555=30{\displaystyle 54*.5555=30}


54∗59=30{\displaystyle 54*{\frac {5}{9}}=30}


, Once you've subtracted 32 and multiplied by 59{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{9}}}, you're in Celsius. Now just add 273.15 to get to Kelvin and call it a day.


30+273.15={\displaystyle 30+273.15=}303.15K{\displaystyle 303.15K}

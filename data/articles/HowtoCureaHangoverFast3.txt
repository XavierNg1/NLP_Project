 Since the fastest way to recover from a hangover is to avoid one in the first place, start by eating well before you start drinking. This will reduce the impact that the alcohol has on your body because the food that is digesting will slow the alcohol’s absorption. Good choices of food to eat before hand include bread, milk, cheese, and meat. These will be digested slowly and are high in protein., Since most people get a poor night’s sleep after drinking too much, getting ahead of this and making sure you feel refreshed before drinking will reduce the impact that a bad night’s sleep will have on your body. If you know that you are going out this weekend you may want to sleep more during the week to stay rested., In an effort to keep your body’s hydration on par with the dehydration effects of alcohol, order a glass of water with every beverage. Drinking a water after each beer, for example, will prevent you from being dehydrated, potentially reducing the symptoms of a hangover the next day., It typically takes your body 60 to 75 minutes to metabolize an alcoholic beverage, so allowing your body to recover from one before consuming the next is a good way to prevent a hangover. Slow drinking also prevents your blood alcohol from rising too quickly., To prevent any ill effects of dehydration, finish your night with a few extra glasses of water. To remind yourself to do this (since, if you are drunk, you probably won’t be thinking about water), set out a glass of water on the kitchen counter or next to your bed. Some people might even set out their NSAID too.


If you think you’ll be spending the night somewhere else, set a reminder alarm on your phone.

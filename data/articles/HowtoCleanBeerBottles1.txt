 If your bottles will not fit in a gallon tub, then use a bigger tub like a two or three gallon tub.Alternatively, you can use your sink. Place a stopper in your drain and then place your bottles in the sink.;
, Fill the tub until all of the bottles are fully submerged. Then mix in one to four tablespoons (15 to 60 ml) of bleach per gallon of water. Use a mixing spoon or stick to stir and disperse the cleaning solution into the bottles.Alternatively, you can use commercial cleaners like OxyClean or PBW (powder brewery wash). If you use these, fill your tub with hot water as opposed to cold water, and follow the dosing guidelines per the instructions on the product.
 If you are using a commercial cleaner, then you may need to let the bottles soak for a longer amount of time like 30 minutes., After the bottles have soaked, you will see the labels beginning to peel off. Put on a pair of protective gloves like nylon gloves. Then begin to slowly peel the labels off.Traces of glue may remain on the bottles after the labels have been peeled off. Use a sponge with an abrasive surface (or a scrub pad) to remove any remaining glue.
 Use a nylon bottle brush to do this. Fill the bottle with a small amount of the solution. Scrub the inside of the bottle to remove any dirt and grime. Scrub each bottle until all dirt and grime are removed.Hold the bottles up to the light to make sure all of the dirt and grime have been removed.
Place the bottles upside down on a drying rack to be sanitized.

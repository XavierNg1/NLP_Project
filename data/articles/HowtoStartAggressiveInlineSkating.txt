 Whether or not they are aggressive style doesn't matter yet, but chances are you have a pair of inline skates sitting around your garage or in your closet or room somewhere. If you don't have a pair though, go buy some (if you're broke, borrow some from a friend). Make sure that they provide a good amount of ankle support and get used to the fact that your ankle doesn't move when you're skating, because if there isn't ankle support than you may end up seriously screwing up your ankles if you land on them incorrectly.;
,, A few easily tackled obstacles would be things like: the recycling bin (emptied first), jumping off of curbs, jumping down a very small amount of steps (2 or 3), and as time goes on you can move to bigger and bigger objects.
 Instead of just jumping over the objects, try doing a 180 over said object.
 Start on the smaller flat ramps and either near the end of the first visit or at the beginning of the next, try dropping in on a quarter or half-pipe.
 This is called airing out of the ramp.



Find a curb or a short ledge of some sort.
Approach the obstacle at a slow speed. When you reach it, jump onto the obstacle placing the h-block or center of your frame onto the corner slide across the surface keeping the center of your balance on your leading foot and jump off when you either feel yourself falling or whenever you reach the end of the object. If you don't slide across your obstacle there are two things you should do.

If you have four wheels on each skate, try taking out the middle two. You actually don't need them to roll anyway, and they just get in the way when grinding. With most aggressive skates there are two very small wheels that don't even touch the ground, you don't have to take those out, they are for helping your grinds, and they donâ€™t get in your way.
Apply wax to the surface you are grinding on. you can use candle wax for this, but there is special skating wax commonly used for just this purpose.

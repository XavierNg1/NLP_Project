Research cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and Carnival. These lines have ships that include waterslides, rock climbing walls, miniature golf and arcades.
Reserve a cabin that is large enough to accommodate your family. Cabins are notoriously small on most cruise ships, so you may need to ask for an upgrade. You can also reserve adjoining cabins.;
, Some cruise lines offer babysitting services on board. This can be helpful if you want to enjoy some nightlife or do things without the kids during the day.



Choose Caribbean destinations that offer private beaches, hiking, snorkeling, and other activities that you and your children will enjoy.
 If you want to eat with your kids, choose the early dining time, which is usually around 6:00 p.m.


Look into other options if you would prefer a leisurely dinner without the kids. Royal Caribbean has a program that allows you to sit down to dinner with your kids but finish up alone. Staff members collect your kids for a special program after they have eaten.

 It is located on Prosperity Street Promenade, and appears as a T-shirt icon on your map. When you enter the shop, you will see a short cutscene in which the robbers steal from the shop and then escape on foot.


This random event will not appear as a blip on your radar.During the cutscene, take note of which robber has the cash bag.
 The robbers will have run in separate directions. Shoot at the robber carrying the cash bag until you’ve killed him.


You can kill them all, if you want, but it’s unnecessary. The robbers who are not carrying the cash bag will only drop the amount most non-playable characters (NPCs) carry, around $20.
 You will obtain $2,000 if you decide to keep the money. Returning it to the store owners will result in a 25% discount on one item.The discount is only available at this Suburban shop.
You can exit the shop and still be able to use the discount once you return.

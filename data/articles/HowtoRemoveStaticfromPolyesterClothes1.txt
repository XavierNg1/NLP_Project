 The fabric softeners are positively charged, so they will bond with the negative charge found in the polyester clothes, which helps balance and neutralize static buildup., The friction created when garments rub together in a dry environment, like a tumble dryer, can cause electrical charges to cling to the fabric, which creates static electricity.To help minimize static, add a couple of dryer sheets to your tumble dryer. As the sheets heat up, they release and oil that then lightly coats the polyester clothing. This lubrication helps minimize the amount of friction, which reduces static cling.Be sure to dry polyester garments at a low temperature., When added to the dryer, wool dryer balls can help clothes dry more quickly and help reduce static cling by preventing the clothes from sticking together. As they move around, the balls help separate the clothing and expose them to the dry air.This separation also reduces friction, thereby minimizing static.


Dryer balls aren’t as effective if they are added to a large load of clothes. Make sure you only add them to small and medium loads so they have room to move around.Add three large dryer balls per load.If you don't have a dryer ball, add a tennis ball or two to your tumble dryer to get the same effect.
 Skip the dryer all together and air dry your polyester clothes to prevent the buildup of static electricity.Allowing polyester clothing to air dry won’t damage the garments, so clip the garments on a clothes line to dry in the sun, or drape the clothes over a drying rack indoors.

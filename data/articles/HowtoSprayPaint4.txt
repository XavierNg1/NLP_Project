 Rust will not only give a rough surface texture, but it will cause the paint to chip off over time. Use ingredients from your kitchen like vinegar and baking soda or purchase rust remover from a hardware store to do this.


Allow the vinegar or a paste of baking soda and water to sit on the metal for several hours to dissolve away the rust.
Use anything from steel wool to a toothbrush to scrub off the rusty reside after soaking.
 Use sandpaper to remove the sheen from the metal and make it better for the paint to stick to. The metal should lose its gloss and feel a bit rough to the touch.
 After removing the rust and sanding the surface, be sure to give a thorough wipe down to the metal with a damp cloth.
 Add one even coating of primer to the entirety of the surface.
 Follow the same painting tips as aforementioned and give an even coat of paint to the metal. Add multiple coats if desired.

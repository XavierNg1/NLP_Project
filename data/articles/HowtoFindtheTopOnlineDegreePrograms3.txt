 In order to ensure that your degree will be recognized by potential employers, you will need to get your education from an accredited institution. Non-accredited institutions will carry little or no weight with many employers and can therefore be a waste of your money and time. The DOE offers a searchable database of accredited colleges and universities. Use this database to determine which colleges on your list are accredited. Once done, you can eliminate any that are not.

 The degree sign is available in the Symbols section of your device's keyboard.
 This is typically located in the bottom-left corner, next to the keyboard.
 Mot keyboards split the symbols onto two keyboards. You'll typically need to switch to the second view to find the degree sign. The way you do this depends on the keyboard. Usually you'll either tap a key with mathematics symbols on it, or you'll tap a ">" key to switch to the second view.
 This will insert a degree sign into your text.

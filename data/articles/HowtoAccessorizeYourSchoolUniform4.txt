 Embrace a new style of shoe, such as a different height or toe, to add interest to your look. If you usually wear wedges, you could try a neat ballet flat. If you usually wear an open-toed sandal, try a short boot to switch things up.
 If the style of shoe you can wear is restricted by the dress code, wear a fun color for a new twist. Burgundy, forest green and cobalt are all subdued enough to satisfy many school dress codes while still setting you apart.


If shoe color is highly restricted, try swapping in some different laces for a new look.
 Try shoes with a floral, geometric, or other pattern to liven up your uniform. Since most uniforms are in flat, neutral colors, embracing a pattern on your feet can add color and interest to your look. Plus, since shoes are not a huge accessory, even loud or busy patterns are often very wearable.Try a polka-dotted kitten heel for a retro spin on your uniform, for example.
You could try a ballet flat in a blue floral pattern to go with a navy uniform, for example.
 You can add some sparkle to your shoes by gluing on glitter or using a bedazzler to add gems and grommets. This is a fun and playful look that sets your shoes apart, even if they have to meet various other rules. You could try bedazzling just the toe, or adding glitter to only the heel as a creative accent.

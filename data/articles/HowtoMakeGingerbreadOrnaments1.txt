 Gingerbread dough for cookies or for making a gingerbread house is fine to use.
 A gingerbread person is easiest but you can draw an angel, an animal, heavenly bodies and so forth, depending on what you'd like. Draw the template onto card, then cut it out in readiness for using on the dough.

You can print off a simple outline image from online if you find that easier than drawing a design freehand.
 This must be done before making the dough shapes, so that you have a place to transfer the ornaments to after cutting. Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF., Roll the gingerbread dough to a thickness around 6mm (1/4 inch)., Using a sharp kitchen knife, carve around the template design in the dough. Lift out the gingerbread shape and put it on the lined sheet or tray., Each time that there is no more space to press out ornaments, bunch up the dough and roll it out again. You may also need to sprinkle fresh flour on the workspace., Bake for about 8 to 10 minutes, or until firm.,, Tie ribbon around the ring when it has dried in place, and make a loop from the ribbon. It's now ready to hang.

Alternatively, pierce a small hole in the center top of each ornament. Use a skewer or similar item for this. Thread ribbon through the hole. Tie in a firm loop.

, You will need mounting bolts and nuts as well. Generally the center of the table is the best spot to put the vise. Position the vise so that its clamps are parallel to the long side. Make sure that the vise's tightening bolt is pointed towards you for easy access. Now hand tighten the bolts.
 Mount this in the mill using a collet by tightening the machine from the top. Do not operate mill with dial indicator attached. Position the table so that the tip on the indicator is touching the stationary clamp of the vise.

The indicator dial is designed to move if the vise is not parallel to the x-axis. To straighten the vise, move the table in the y-axis and pay close attention to the dial. Make adjustments to the vise until the dial does not move when the table is moved in the y- axis.
 Make it tight but do not overdo it., Obtain a set of parallels that will raise your part out of the vise high enough to work on but still be secure. Tighten the vise so that the part is snug but do not tighten all the way at first.
 When the part is flat, the parallels shouldn't move. Once you have gotten the part in flat, tighten the vise the rest of the way and recheck the parallels. Repeat step 2 if parallels move., Start up the mill and run it between 500 and 1000 RPM. Do not change the RPM of the mill without the machine running.
 Your edge finder should look like it's spinning off balanced., When the edge finder "jumps" into spinning straight, stop adjustment., This is your zero point. Remember that this point is actually off from the side of the part by the length of the radius of your edge finder.,, Your mill should now be zeroed and ready to go. Remember the measurement implications that come along with using an edge finder.

 The game can be played online on Facebook or on your mobile devices through its app. Open it and press the “Play” button on the welcome screen to begin.;
, You will be shown the game map. Tap or click the level you want to play. Note that not all levels will have alligators in them. You will know if alligators are part of the level by checking the goals on the pre-game screen. If you see a green creature, then you will have to make and collect alligators in the game. Alligators and their eggs first appear in level 101.
 Alligators will not appear right away. They need to be hatched from eggs first. The eggs will appear together with the other cropsies, and they are located on nests., On levels that require you to hatch eggs, you will have the Egg Cracker booster. This booster will make it easier for you to hatch all those eggs. Tap or click the Egg Cracker booster from the top right corner. The button looks like a cracked egg.
 Once the booster is activated, it will pass through the whole board cracking all the eggs on it once. The eggs won’t hatch right away as you need to break them three times. Using the Egg Cracker booster is one way to break the eggs. You can use the Egg Cracker multiple times, but it’s limited, so use it wisely.
 You don’t need to use the Egg Cracker booster to crack eggs all the time. Making matches with the eggs will also crack them for you.
 The final break needs to be done by matching the cracked eggs, at least three in a row or column. Once you do, an alligator will appear. It will scramble off the screen, and will be counted towards your level’s goals.

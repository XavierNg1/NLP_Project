 Anti-nausea wristbands are designed to apply pressure to the correct pressure point on your wrist. They usually have a knob or flat button positioned over the acupressure point. Several styles are available and are made from knitted fabric, plastic, or woven nylon.


Choose a band based on your own preferences, budget, and sense of style.
 If you don't want to spend money on a band, you can put together one using a wristwatch or sweatband and a small stone or button. Simply place the stone or button underneath the band and secure., With your opposite hand, place 3 fingers below the crease of your wrist. Place your thumb right below them and center it in between the two large tendons. This is the pressure point.Specifically, you're looking for the P6, or inner gate, pressure point which relieves nausea. The same point on the opposite side of your arm is known as the P5, or outer gate.
 Make sure the knob, button, bead, or stone is directly covering the pressure point. Then, secure the band so you feel medium to firm pressure on that spot. The wristband should not slide or wiggle around your wrist, but be set firmly in place.


Make sure the wristband is not too tight. You should not feel pain; if you do, loosen the band.
You might feel relief as soon as you put it on, but after your body grows accustomed to the pressure, you'll need to press down on the acupressure point for extra relief.

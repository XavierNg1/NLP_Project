 Both the plug and coil wires are located at the rear of almost all V8 engines. Four-cylinder engines have them placed on the right side, near the center of the engine. Six-cylinder engines are on the opposite: left side, near the center of the engine.
 Run a jump cable from the positive battery terminal to either the positive side of the coil, or the red wire that leads to the coil. This will give power to the dashboard, which is essential if you want to start the engine.
 On Ford cars, it is on the right-side fender well, near the battery. On GM cars, it is on the starter under the steering wheel.
 Place a flat blade screwdriver in the top center of the steering column, pushing between the wheel and the column. You want to push the locking pin away from the wheel. Don't worry, you're allowed to be rough here.


The locking pin will not break or set off any alarms and you should be able to find the solenoid should be underneath.
 You will see a small wire at the top of the solenoid and the positive battery cable below. Remove the ignition switch wire from the solenoid and, using an insulated screwdriver, short the solenoidâ€™s positive post to the terminal where the ignition switch connects.


Doing so will apply 12 volts directly from the battery. This should activate the solenoid, and the starter should crank the car.

 You are a good candidate for a portable dishwasher if you are renting and unable to renovate the kitchen, or if you lack the space to fit a built-in dishwasher.


Be sure you are willing to put effort into using your portable dishwasher. You will need to physically move it (unless you keep it in one place) and hook it up every time you use it.;
, Most portable dishwashers are 18 inches (45.7 cm) wide. Some models are larger, at 24 inches (61 cm) wide.


Try moving the dishwasher before you buy it to make sure it is not too heavy.
 The capacity will depend on the number of dishes that you will want to load into the dishwasher. Most portable models are smaller than built-in dishwashers, but Frigidaire makes one that can hold as much as a built-in dishwasher.



Look for a stainless steel tub to prevent rusting or cracking.
Find a dishwasher with multiple wash cycles if you need them. Some models come with rinse and hold cycles.
Decide what rack features you want. You can find dishwashers with adjustable racks or a removable upper rack.
Browse selections that include advanced features as well, such as a delayed start option, or a mechanism that grinds food before the dishwasher is turned on.
 Some models are more complicated than others, and depending on your home, you may need to connect multiple hoses and power sources.


Consider storage. When you are not using the hoses and coils, you will want to keep them out of the way so they do not just drag on the floor. Some models allow you to hang or clip them on the back of the dishwasher.
 Many portable dishwashers have finished sides and tops. Look for a color or finish that matches your kitchen.
 The most popular makers of portable dishwashers include General Electric and Frigidaire.
 For a larger selection and more competitive pricing, search online for portable dishwashers. Check sites for major brands, or consider buying a used model from retailers such as eBay or Amazon.
 Before you buy, make sure you can return the dishwasher if it is damaged or you do not like it. Inquire about warranties as well.

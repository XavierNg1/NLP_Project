 Before you actually start planning any date you will want to think about who you are inviting on the date. You will want to make sure that everyone going on the date will be compatible with one another. Take a few moments to think about the personalities of those going on the date to make sure it will be a good one.Think about the other couple you are bringing along and make sure they will be a good fit for you and your partner.
Try to find a good mix of personalities that will prevent any one person from dominating the conversation or from shying away.;
, Although you will be going on a double date, taking a few moments alone with your partner can be a good idea. This small break can give you both some time to enjoy each others company alone and discuss your thoughts and feelings about the evening. Think about some ways you can enjoy small moments as a couple during your double date.You might try asking your date to grab the next round of drinks with you.
Getting up to dance with your date can give you both a few minutes together.
 Going on a double date will require you all to pay careful attention to everyone's mood and level of engagement. Whatever the reason, you will have to step in and engage someone if it feels like they aren't comfortable, are acting withdrawn, or are being excluded. Keep everyone engaged and part of the evening to help make your double date a good one.If someone hasn't spoken in some time you should steer your conversation in a direction that involves their thoughts.
Make sure to focus your energy on the other couple and not just your own date.
 Part of double dating is sharing the evening with another couple. This couple won't share the same bond that you and your date might. Always avoid over-sharing personal details or being overly affectionate with your partner when on a double date to keep things comfortable.Don't discuss anything too personal that might make the other couple uncomfortable.
Keep your displays of affection light.

 A fact family is a set of facts, or mathematical problems, that use the same numbers. The are three numbers in each fact family. These three numbers can be added or subtracted in different ways. For example, 10, 3, and 7 form a fact family. You can use these three numbers to create two addition number sentences and two subtraction number sentences:


10-3=7
10-7=3
7+3=10
3+7=10, Write or state a subtraction word problem for your students:


I have 7 candies. I eat 3 of the candies. How many candies do I have left., Walk your students through the process step by step:


Ask your students which number sentence they are trying to solve. Write “7-3=?” on the board.
Ask them to determine the third member of the fact family. Write the following number sentences on the board: “3+__=7”; “__+3=7”; “; “7-__=3”; and 7-3=__” Fill in the blanks as the students provide you with the answers.

 Go to Facebook.com and enter your email address and password to log in.
 Click on the downward-facing triangle on the top right corner of your page (next to the lock icon). This will open a drop-down menu that includes options like “Create Page”, “Activity Log”, “Log Out”, and “Help”. To open your settings, click on “Settings” in this drop-down menu.
 Once you are in your “Settings”, ensure that the “General” tab is selected. It is the tab at the top left of the “Settings” menu. When you open “Settings”, it should be automatically opened to the “General” tab.
 Beneath the “General” settings box to the right of the “General” settings tab, you’ll see the words “Download a copy of your Facebook data”. Click on the blue “Download a copy” text.
 When you click on “Download a copy”, a new page will open that says “Download Your Information” and offers you the option to click a green button that says “Download Archive”. Click on this button.
 To continue with the download, you’ll need to enter your Facebook password and hit “Submit” on the pop-up window.
 If the download doesn’t save directly to your computer, check your email account that’s associated with your Facebook account. You should receive an email from Facebook that tells you that your download has begun. Once the download is complete, you’ll receive another email containing a link that brings you to the page with the “Download Archive” button.
 Once you have downloaded the archive to your computer, a subfolder titled facebook-yourusername will appear in your Downloads folder. Open it.
 Inside the facebook-yourusername folder you’ll see a file titled index.htm. Once you open that file, you can navigate your saved data as though you were on an HTML version of your Facebook page., Do this before deleting the messages you want to delete.
 Once you’ve saved backups of your Facebook data, you can delete whatever messages you want without permanently losing copies of your messages.

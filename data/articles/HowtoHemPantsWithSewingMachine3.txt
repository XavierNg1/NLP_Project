 Fold the pants so that the outside of the pants are facing out. You should be able to see the inner seam. This will make it easier to sew the hem. You could simply fold the legs inside out without doing this to the entire pants.
 Fold up the hem from the edge up to the top line. Make sure your top line or crease is on the edge of the fold. This edge will be the hem. Make sure the size looks good before you finalize the job.
 Take your pants onto an ironing board. Wait till the iron is fully heated. Then iron the fold down. This will create a professional fold and ensure that you don't have any uneven lines., Load the bobbin with the thread of your choice. You can use matching thread to blend in, or a contrasting color, like the gold thread used on most denim jeans.
 For a simple hem set your machine for a straight stitching, or a small or medium straight thread., Make sure you position your pant leg so the machine only stitches the hem and not the leg's opening together. Sew about 1/8 inch from the top of the hem. Continue sewing in a straight line around the circumference of the leg., Follow the same steps on the other leg. Don't forget to iron the seam on the opposite leg and compare the length with the finished leg. This is your last chance to fix any irregularities in the length.
 You can now wear your jeans.

 If you have tried a few times to address your boss’s bullying behavior immediately after it occurred and nothing changed, it may be more productive to schedule a meeting for a less emotional time.


Choose a private setting for your conversation. A neutral location, like a conference room, or an off-site location, such as a coffee shop, is better for the meeting than your boss’s office.
Invite a representative from your HR department to sit in on the meeting.
 It may seem intimidating to confront your bullying boss, but it is a vital step in developing a better workplace relationship and standing up for yourself. If you maintain a sense of control over your emotions and speak objectively, you will be more persuasive and can help keep the conversation from becoming overheated.


Don’t be accusatory. State the issues in your own words and offer ways you both can work together.Stick to the facts and be professional. You can say something like, “I don’t appreciate you calling me names, and I hope we can have more productive, professional interactions in the future.”
Cite specific examples: “It is not appropriate for you to yell at me in front of the entire marketing team.”
If you stand up for yourself, the bully may back down.
 After you speak with your boss about the bullying issues, make sure you record what happened at the meeting and what was agreed upon.


Follow up this meeting with your boss with an e-mail confirming what transpired.Forward a copy to the HR department, and keep a copy for yourself.

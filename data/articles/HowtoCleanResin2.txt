 In order to clean resin from a 3D printer, you will first have to remove the resin tank and platform. To do so, remove the platform first to avoid getting resin on it. Then, gently slide the resin tray out of place by holding it by the front tabs, sides, or rims. Avoid touching the glass as you do not want to stain it with fingerprints.Some resin trays may be held in place with tabs, so consult your user's manual for precise instructions for your machine.
 If you have an old resin bottle on hand, it's best to use this to store the resin. Do not pour old resin into a bottle of new resin. Pour the resin into an old container so the tray is completely empty., Use a spray bottle filled with isopropyl alcohol to clean the tray. You can buy isopropyl alcohol online or at a department store. Gently spritz down the inside of the tank with the alcohol. Then, use a wipe out any stuck-on resin using a paper towel., The glass window found above the tray should be cleaned as well. Some resin may be stuck onto the glass. Put on a pair of gloves and use your fingers to gently rub or peel off any resin.If any alcohol got onto the glass tray, use a lens wipe or microfiber cloth to remove it.

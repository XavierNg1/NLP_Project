 Keep a calendar online or by your desk and log what posts you want to blog about on specific days. Give yourself deadlines like you would have at any job and, not only will you spend less time blogging, but you will become accountable to yourself.;
, Don't say that you'll blog at some point; set aside an hour or 2 each day, whether it's in the morning before work or at night before you go to bed, that is specifically for blogging. Setting a specific time each day to blog will keep you on schedule and maximize the use of your time. You might find that you actually feel like you have more time to do other things, since you are spending less time blogging.
 Keep a list of post ideas so you will always have a place to go for new topics. You will spend less time blogging if you don't have to think up a new idea every time you want to write something.
 If you find you don't have enough time to blog daily, hire some guest writers or cross-post something you wrote for another blog. Maybe you're not comfortable updating your blog's HTML, so find someone who can do that for you. You may have to spend a bit of money, but you'll spend less time blogging in the long run.
 Answering questions that your readers may ask in the comments can eat up a lot of your day. Instead of responding to your readers' comments as they come in, set aside a block of time each day specifically for addressing all of the comments that come in on any of your posts.
 Everyone is guilty of sneaking in an extra episode of their favorite TV show or wasting time on Facebook or Twitter when they should be writing. Shut off the TV and don't open a web browser until your blog post is finished. You will spend less time blogging if you don't stop every 5 minutes to answer an email.

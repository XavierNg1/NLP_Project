 The bigger the gap, the better it teases out the curls. Choose a comb with sturdy teeth, that won't break against your hair.;
, If you struggle to get a comb through, use one of these treatments before you begin combing:


If your hair feels extra greasy, apply dry shampoo, followed by dry conditioner.
If your hair isn't greasy, but still hard to brush, use detangling spray, coconut oil, or olive oil.
 Divide your hair into front right, back right, front left, and back left sections, and clip them apart. Divide each of these sections in half again if your hair is extra thick.
 Comb each section with downward motions. Start near the end of your hair, teasing out knots before moving to a slightly higher position.


Be careful not to snag knots too hard or you'll rip the hair from the root. If your comb gets stuck, work the hair off it with your fingers and try again.
 Wet hair is sometimes easier and less painful to comb, but is also more likely to break or split. If your scalp is sensitive, wet your hair and try again. For better results, try the following:


Wet hair and apply conditioner.
Leave in for one hour.
Rinse out conditioner.
Pat dry with a microfiber towel or cotton T-shirt, then comb. Do not use a towel, as the friction from towels adds frizz to your hair.
 If you treated your hair with oil, get rid of it with an application of dry shampoo.

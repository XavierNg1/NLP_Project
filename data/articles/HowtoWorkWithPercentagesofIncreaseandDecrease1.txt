";
, The amount that exists after the percentage has been applied can also be called the "new amount".


For our question, we do not know the percent. We know that $40 is the original, and that's $32 is the "after."

, Make sure the "after amount" goes into the calculator first.


For our example, type 32, hit divide, type 40, hit equals.
This division gives us: 0.8. (It's not the final answer.)

, For our sample problem, 0.8 changes to 80%.
 If your answer is smaller than 100%, you have a decrease or discount; larger than 100% is an increase.


Because the price in the example dropped, and the price that we calculated is also a discount, we're on the right path.
If the price in the example dropped from $40 to $32, however, and we got 120% after our calculation, we'd know that something is wrong because we're looking for a discount and we got an increase.
 Figure out how much above or below 100% you are and this will be your final answer. In our sample problem, 80% compared to 100% means that we had a discount of 20%.
 To get the hang of things, read the prompt and see if you understand how to finish the following problems:


Problem #1: "A $50 blouse is now $28. What was the percentage of discount?"

To solve it, grab a calculator. Enter '28,' hit divide, enter '50,' hit equals; the answer is 0.56.
Convert '0.56' to '56%'. Compare this number to 100%, subtracting '56' from '100', leaving us with a discount of 44%.


Problem #2: "A $12 baseball cap is $15 after tax. What was the sales tax percentage?"

To solve it, grab a calculator. Enter '15', hit divide, enter '12', hit equals; the answer is 1.25.
Convert '1.25' to '125%'. Compare this to 100%, subtracting '100' from '125', leaving us with an increase of 25%.

 The most straightforward way to brew lemon beer is to add a small amount of lemon juice to the beer during secondary fermentation. Some of the sugars in the lemon juice will undergo fermentation, which will add complexity to the beer. However, the basic brightness of the lemon will remain present in the beer's finished flavor.
 An option for adding more subtle lemon flavor to your beer is to steep lemon peel in the secondary fermenter. The lemon peel contains the fruit's essential oils, which are very flavorful and will not be metabolized by the yeast. You can also steep complementary spices in the secondary fermenter, such as clove or cinnamon.
 A third option for making lemon beer is to use a prepared product such as lemon jam. The flavor in these products is often more concentrated than in lemon juice, and it won't tend to dissipate so much between fermentation and consumption. Note that the sugar present in jams and jellies will increase the gravity of your beer.
 Of course, a simple way to make sure the lemon tastes as fresh as possible in your beer is to add it to your glass just before drinking. Adding a lemon wedge to your beer glass can be an easy way to improve its presentation or even to test a beer recipe for the possible addition of lemon during fermentation.

 Overeating cannot be treated like flu. It is a bad habit, like smoking or drinking alcohol, not a disease. You should quit your habit, not just lose weight, or it will come back again quickly. You will need to change your lifestyle, not your pills.;
, Appetite suppressants are mostly quite powerful medicine, they may cause great impact on your body, and so consulting your doctor about your overall health state and possible pills prescriptions is definitely a wise idea.
 Pills will not do the job alone. You will need to eat less, move more, and spend time doing some physical acts like cycling, jogging, swimming and/or playing sports instead of sitting on a sofa in the evening.
 Changes are harsh. Sometimes your wish to drop all this hard work and go eat another portion of your favorite meal will be overwhelming. Many people give up in the very beginning, after doing merely several exercises and dieting for a couple of days. They continue growing fat and ugly and say this is their constitution or metabolism. Pathetic, aren’t they? Do not be one of these people, as it is your health and well-being, so – stick to the plan.
 Taking your pills and watching movies all day long will not help you a bit. Pills are you supporters; they will assist you in doing harsh work of burning your fat down, not doing it instead of you.

 This is a good amount of kefir grains to start with, as it will produce a nice average kefir flavor. As you get into the practice of making kefir, experiment with adding more seeds or fewer seeds. You'll see the the amount of seeds you use really affects the flavor, and it's all a matter of personal preference.
 Again, the amount of milk you use in relation to the kefir is a matter of preference, but 2 1/2 cups is a good place to start. Don't fill the far all the way to the top, since the mixture needs room to breathe during the fermentation process; you should keep it about 2/3 full.
 Designate a spot on the counter or in your cabinet to store the kefir. If you put it in the refrigerator the fermentation process won't take place.
 The fermentation process takes several hours, so the easiest thing to do is prepare the kefir seeds and milk at night and use it in the morning. The longer you let the seeds do their work, the more tangy the kefir will taste and the thicker it will get.


If you prefer less flavorful kefir, you can use it after 5 hours or so instead of waiting all night.
Coconut kefir takes longer to ferment. You may have to let it sit for longer than 8 hours.
 Place a piece of cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer over a second jar or a bowl. Pour the kefir from the original jar through the cheesecloth, separating the kefir seeds from the liquid. The kefir is now ready to drink or store in the refrigerator.
 Rinse the seeds in distilled water (never tap water). Place them in a clean jar, fill it with milk, and start the process over. If you're not yet ready for a second batch of kefir, you can rest the kefir by placing the seeds in a jar, adding milk, and letting it sit for a week before straining.

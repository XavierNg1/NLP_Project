 You want to make sure you have quick access to a fire blanket in the event of an emergency. Store it in an easy-to-reach place that you can access without too much trouble.


It's best to store fire blankets in the kitchen, as this is where most home fires break out.
The sooner you can get to, and use, a fire blanket, the better the chances are of containing the fire., Fire blankets are not designed to be reused. It can be dangerous to use a fire blanket again if it's already been used to fight a fire. Wait until a fire blanket is room temperature to the touch before disposing it. Just to be safe, it might not be a bad idea to douse the fire blanket in water before disposal., You should never be without a fire blanket or extinguisher in the event of an emergency. As soon as possible, replace any fire blankets in your home.

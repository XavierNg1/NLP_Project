Generally, the UK is 5 hours ahead of the US Eastern time zone, so adjust based on your US time zone.
For a brief period of a week or two in the spring or fall, the UK is only four hours ahead, as the US and UK do not switch to and from Daylight Savings Time simultaneously.
If you're not sure, you can find the current UK time by going to Google.com, and entering "UK time" in the search field. Google will return the correct current time in the UK.

Wear hats and scarves when going outside, even in the winter. The cold air can be just as damaging as the hot sun. Consider using a UV-shielding spray for your hair if you are going to be outside on a hot, sunny day for a long time.

They give shampoo that nice lather, but they can also strip your hair of its natural oils and make it dry and brittle.

 Start from the ends ad work your way upward, brushing in small sections at a time. If you have curly hair, consider using a wide-toothed comb. Never brush your hair from the roots straight down; this can cause your hair to snag and tear, which will make the split ends even worse.

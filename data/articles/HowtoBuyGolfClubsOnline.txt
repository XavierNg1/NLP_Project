 But, you need to understand the risks of buying online. Aside from the scams and fraudulent site that are taunting us everyday to buy now, you can even have a bad experience from a reputable site. Golf clubs are a very personable thing and one size does not fit all. So before you make that purchase, take a little time upfront so you don't have a big headache in the end.;
, The best way to do that is to visit a local golf shop and try to hit a bunch of the clubs to see what is the best for you. Many of these shops will also provide you a free golf swing analysis. This will also help with the type of shaft, flex, lie and length of the club. Having this information will provide you a better chance of getting the right club.
 Key signs they are a reliable website include:


They have a phone number (800 preferred) and contact information easily available
They are members of the better business bureau
They post a Hacker Safe or similar logo
They take major credit cards through a secure shopping cart
They offer a warranty on their product. Make sure it is posted clearly on their site.
Better yet, they offer some sort of money back guarantee. Since you can't physically see the product, this is advantageous if you get the clubs and they are not what you expected.
 Many of these clubs are excellent alternatives to the name brands, especially when you consider the cost savings. The same principles apply in deciding on the company to purchase from. A money back guarantee is really critical to ensure the product is everything that they say it is.

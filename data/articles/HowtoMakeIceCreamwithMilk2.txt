 Condensed milk is typically sold in non-refrigerated cans. For this recipe, you want make sure the milk is good and cold before mixing your ingredients. Place it in the fridge for a few hours before you get started.
 Take the heavy cream out of the refrigerator and get to work immediately, since you want to make sure your ingredients are very cold when you mix them together. Start by beating the cream at a medium speed using a whisk attachment. Continue beating until stiff peaks form.


If you donâ€™t have a stand mixer, a hand mixer will work fine.
 Once your stiff peaks have started to form, take the chilled condensed milk out of the fridge. Turn the mixer speed down to low and slowly pour the condensed milk in with the cream. Add the vanilla extract.
 After the additional ingredients have been added, turn the mixer back up to medium speed. Keep beating the mixture until it thickens and stiff peaks begin to form again. The peaks will be much thicker this time around.
 If you like your vanilla ice cream with additional flavors and additives, now is the time to add them! You can add anything you want, so experiment and have fun. Try adding crushed cookies, fruit purees, nuts, cake pieces, chocolate syrup and more to create your own custom flavor. Stir the mixture well to fully incorporate your add-ins.


For example, to make strawberry cheesecake ice cream, add 1 cup of cheesecake and your desired amount of strawberry puree.
Mix in 2/3 cup crushed Oreos to make cookies and cream ice cream.
Add 1/4 cup mango puree for a fruity mango ice cream.
 Transfer your ice cream mixture into a large freezer-safe container that can be resealed (like Tupperware). Put it in the freezer for at least 6 hours, or overnight. After 6 hours, your ice cream is ready to be enjoyed.

 Turn your garment inside out and place the fabric onto a flat surface with the wrong side facing up. Use bias tape to measure the edge of the fabric as the length of bias tape should be the same as the edge of the fabric that you want to encase., Once unwrapped, find the wider side of the bias tape and place it on the back of the fabric. Alight the raw edge by using flat hair clips instead of standard sewing pins.Bias tape will always have a slightly wider back side than the front because it allows you to easily catch the back portion when stitching from the front.
 Remove the hair clips as you sew along the folded crease of tape. Backtack at the start and end of the stitch. Use a bobbin thread to match the main fabric and not the bias tape as this will be visible when worn so you want it the thread to be as subtle as possible.Backtack is also known as a backstitch and refers to stitching at the beginning and end of a seam line in the reverse direction. You only need to backtack for a few stitches to secure the stitch. Most sewing machines provide this function with a simple knob or button., The raw edge should be wrapped with the bias tape and secured with hair clips. The stitching you created with the sewing machine should now be covered by the edge of the bias tape. Gently pull the tape as you fold it up and over the raw edge of the material. You want the tape to lie as straight and flat as you can.If you pull the tape too hard over the fabric as you fold it over, it may pucker once you stitch it.
 Remove the bobbin thread and replace it with a thread that matches the colour of the tape and stitch the tape. Backtack at the start and end of your stitching. Remove your clips as you closely stitch to the front edge of the bias tape. Catch the back side of the tape as you stitch.

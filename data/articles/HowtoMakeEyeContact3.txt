 Do not try to force yourself to hold the eyes of every person you meet if you are uncomfortable. Start slowly, reminding yourself to make eye-contact in every conversation .


It is easier to practice while listening to someone instead of while you are talking.
 Smile and nod along to the conversation, rotating your gaze though both eyes, the person's nose, and mouth. When talking, don't feel like you have to make eye-contact the entire time-- change your expression or look away to keep the other person's interest.
 If you struggle with real people, you can practice with a screen or mirror. Try to make eye-contact with every character you can on TV or video blogs. News channels, where the anchor looks right at the camera, are a great way to practice comfortably in your home., Making eye-contact is a sign of trust, reliability, and openness, and helps in a variety of social settings. However, there are some settings when it is vital for success:



Job Interviews: Good eye-contact tells a boss that they can trust you. Be sure to look them in eyes while you talk, as it assures them that you know what you're talking about.

Dates: Eye-contact can help you make an intimate connection, but it can be difficult to look away in a one-on-one setting. Hold your gaze longer than usual to show your attraction.

Arguments: Strong eye-contact is a mark of assertiveness and power. Hold your opponent's gaze for longer periods of time so you do not appear weak or unsure of yourself.

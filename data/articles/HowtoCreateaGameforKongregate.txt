 The version doesn't matter, just as long as it's Flash. You should probably get the latest version (As of this writing, CS5.5) but any version will do. Even versions from back in the Macromedia days, like MX 2004.;
, ActionScript is the programming language used in Flash. It's rather easy to learn and there are tutorials all over the Internet.
 You will almost certainly not be able to make a game entirely on your own. Not a good one, anyway. A small crew of maybe three or four people will be good.
 These are crucial for obvious reasons.
 This will take anywhere from a week to a few years depending on what kind of game you're making, how many collaborators are involved, and how much time is spent on development.
 Unlike Newgrounds, you don't have to worry about getting blamed (taken down for a low rating), so even if it sucks it will always be there, unless you decide to take it down.

 This is because aspergillosis primarily strikes people who have compromised immune systems. As a result, aspergillus and aspergillosis infection is not a substantial risk to healthy people. This is because healthy immune systems are typically able to fight off aspergillus mold relatively quickly., Aspergillus is all around us. It is in the air we breathe, in the homes and buildings we live and work in, and is even in some of the food items we eat. As a result, you should have realistic expectations about how you can minimize exposure to aspergillus and avoid aspergillosis., Aspergillosis, as an infection and disease, manifests in several forms. Each of these forms is more prone to strike individuals with different health problems. As a result, you need to evaluate your risk based on your general health level. Major forms of aspergillosis include:


Allergic pulmonary aspergillosis. This is an allergic reaction to aspergillus spores. People with outstanding lung problems like asthma are much more prone to this variety of aspergillosis.
Aspergilloma. This is when a fungus ball grows in an individualâ€™s lung that has previously been scared by diseases like tuberculosis.
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. This is an infection that can ultimately lead to pneumonia. This infection afflicts people who have weakened immune systems like people with AIDS, cancer, or leukemia.

 The key to any good story is conflict - it is a catalyst for action and change within a narrative. A good script will feature a strong antagonist to stir things up, albeit not always a human character (e.g. a storm that strands characters together). If the show you are writing for has a regular villain or other recurring troublemakers, use them to instigate conflict, which will demonstrate your ability to work within the show's parameters.For example, choose a well-established villain like Professor Moriarty if you write a spec script for the "Sherlock" television series.
 Some television shows have one, clearly-identified protagonist (e.g. Olivia Pope on "Scandal"), while others feature an ensemble cast who alternate leading roles in different episodes (e.g. members of the Bluth family on "Arrested Development"). Be sure that your spec script focuses on one character within one main story-line. If the episode features sub-plots, make sure they operate as their own story an do not upstage or confuse the main narrative.As a general rule, the person reading your script should always be able to answer the question, "Whose story is this?"

, Most television series follow their characters through a few main settings on a regular basis (e.g. home, work, and a local cafe). Decide whether your spec script will focus heavily on one setting or follow the episode's protagonist through them all. The former would be best suited for a plot driven by one of these settings itself, such as an office shake-up that creates the drama needed for the episode.

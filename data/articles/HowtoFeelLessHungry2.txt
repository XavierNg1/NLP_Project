 Consuming more fiber, especially in the morning, will add bulk to your diet and make you feel full for longer. Fiber stays in your stomach longer than other foods, so you will have a sense of being full and less hungry during the day. Protein can also help keep you feeling satisfied, and it suppresses the hormone ghrelin, which signals your brain it is time to eat.Try oatmeal with peanut butter or wheat toast and an egg.


You can also add flaxseed to your breakfast cereal, your yogurt, or your morning smoothie. Flaxseeds are high in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids and can be ground in a coffee grinder or a food processor to then add to foods.
Omega-3 fatty acids can also suppress your appetite by triggering the production of leptin, which can lead to feelings of satiety., Being sleep-deprived can lead to anxious snacking and overeating. A good nightâ€™s sleep can reduce your cortisol levels, the hormone that rises when you are anxious or stressed. Avoid stress eating by committing to eight hours of sleep a night., Most alcohol can make you hungry and lead to overeating. If you are of age, enjoy a glass of wine or beer at the end of your meal, instead of before or during the meal. This way you will be drinking on a full stomach and be less likely to be hungry later or end up wanting to snack late at night., Look at your daily activities and try to schedule your meals for the same time each day, with about three to four hours between them. Eating at the same time each day can help prevent swings in the hormones that control appetite.Try to keep healthy, portioned snacks in your purse or backpack in case your meal is delayed and you need a snack.

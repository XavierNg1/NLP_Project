 Making a meal plan is essential to only buying what you need and staying under budget. If you don't already have healthy recipes you love, find some you like online or ask your friends for recommendations.One site you can try is the USDA's What's Cooking website (https://whatscooking.fns.usda.gov/). It has healthy recipes that you can use to plan meals.
Don't forget to plan around your schedule. Opt for leftovers or quick meals on nights you're going to be busy., You may think that eating healthy means you need to try out a bunch of new trendy health foods. While these trendy foods may be healthy, that doesn't mean they're the only healthy foods. Stick to simpler ingredients that you know, even something as simple as a roasted chicken with vegetables and brown rice. You'll be more likely to keep eating healthy, and you'll save money at the same time., Once you've planned out your meals, create a list of the items you'll need. Sticking to a list (and not buying extras) can help you stay on budget, so you can afford healthier food., Meal planning isn't just for eating at home. It can help to make a plan before you go to a restaurant. Look over the menu if it's available online, and compare calorie counts. Many restaurants have the calorie counts available, but you can also use online calorie counters or websites.Consider choosing a healthy appetizer to save money. It will also keep the portion small.
Opt for dishes with lean proteins paired with whole grains and lots of veggies.
Choose veggies or fruit over fries, onion rings, or mashed potatoes.
Ask for a take-out box when you get your food. Split it in half before you start eating, and put half in the box to take home. Splitting it up helps you control your portion and stretch your money.

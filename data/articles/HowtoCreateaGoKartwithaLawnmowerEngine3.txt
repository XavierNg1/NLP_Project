 You should round the edges of your bumper by connecting the vertical pieces that link to your frame and the horizontal piece parallel to the back piece of your frame with a short connector cut on a 22.5 degree angle. Drill holes for your tube padding into the back of your bumper.


Drill 5/16" centered holes through your bumper padding at 1 1/8" from the padding end.
 Cut a 1" x 1" section of square tubing and weld bolts to the ends. A 6" bolt will go on the driver's side of your kart, while a 4" bolt will be on the passenger side. Weld the axle underneath the base of the frame.


Always use proper protective gear when welding. Failing to do so can result in significant harm to yourself.
 A 16 gauge sheet metal piece should be sufficient for the floor of your kart. Using your plans from earlier, drill holes in the sheet for the fastening bolts for your seat.
 You should brace both outer sides of the go kart frame with flat, 3/16" gauge steel. This is where you will install the bench for your seat.

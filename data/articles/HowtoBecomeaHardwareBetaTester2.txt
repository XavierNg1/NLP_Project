 Search their home page for links to applications for beta testers. Or simply Google keyword searches with the company’s name (like, say, “Google”) plus “hardware beta testers” and “application.” Find out how each company recruits their testers.


Many companies will offer online applications that you can submit right away.
Some companies may then screen candidates through direct email or phone calls., The exact format to the application will vary from company to company. However, where appropriate, be sure to include any information that will make you stand out from other candidates. Do the same with any follow-up interviews or surveys that you may be asked to complete.List all types of technology that you own and/or use frequently, such as phones, computers, other devices, and entertainment systems.
Include personal info like age, gender, and location, since they may want to test certain products with specific demographics.
Include your level of expertise with each one. For instance, if you can take a gaming console apart and put it back together again, say so.
On the other hand, if you have no idea how one works but play them every so often, sell yourself as someone who could gauge how easily a product can be used by a novice., Again, the application process may differ from company to company. Expect follow-up surveys or interviews conducted by either the company itself or a second party that has been contracted to oversee their beta testing.Follow any directives about joining and participating in the company’s online community.Complete all necessary prerequisites to qualify for consideration.


Be aware that fewer candidates are picked for hardware testing than with software testing. This is due to the fewer numbers of test units that the company can provide.Since there are more opportunities to test software, consider starting with that to gain a solid reputation and experience with the company.

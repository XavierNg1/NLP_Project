 Look for the Google Drive app on your Android device and tap on it.


You will be brought to the main drive or directory. All your folders and files on Google Drive can be accessed from here.
 Tap the red circle with a plus sign on the screen. The New menu will appear. Tap “Upload” from here, then select “Gallery.” Your mobile gallery will be brought up, and you can see all your pictures from there.


You can navigate through the albums and folders as you normally will.
 Go to the album or folder that contains the picture you want to store on Google Drive, and tap on it. The selected picture will be uploaded to Google Drive.


You can only upload one picture at a time.

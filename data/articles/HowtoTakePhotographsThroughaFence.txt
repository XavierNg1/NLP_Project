 This will help you with ensuring that you focus on the right piece of the frame.;
, For the most part, you will be shooting outdoors and you will be shooting with a longer lens anyway. Use that to help get rid of the fence.
 Real close. If you can get a quarter inch away without scratching your lens, that's great. Be sure that your lens hood is off. What this does is, since the fence is so very close to the camera, for all intents and purposes, it is ignored.
 This will give your camera even less to try to focus on (even though it should be on manual focus).
 This will throw the fence even further out of focus. This is also where the manual focus helps a lot because your depth of field is greatly reduced.
 No matter how much you minimize the fence, if there is a reflection it will make it more visible.
 If you are fighting the fence and your camera, and the subject is only a few feet away, the fence may very well win. Give him some space.
 Forget about getting rid of it, use it.

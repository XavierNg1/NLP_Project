 Since the cheat works by generating the item or structure where the cursor is, you’re better off placing it somewhere wide and accessible. It won’t spawn if the area is too small to hold a Pond, and you wouldn’t want it too near your stuff. Go to a clear place at least a screen or two from your camp’s location.


To make it look naturally generated, place it in the nearest Grasslands or in a Forest area.
 This method only works for the PC, and this will immediately place a pond right where your mouse is pointed at, so make sure you see the mouse cursor on the screen before you enter the cheat code.
 The DebugSpawn code is simply a code that generates items and structures depending on what item name you type in. While you’ll need a guide to find all the item names, the Frog Pond is simply “pond” in the game’s files, ensuring that you get a single Frog Pond every time you use the cheat.


To get rid of the scrolling text that remains on the screen after you finish putting in your cheat, press CTRL + L.
The other ponds are known as “pond_mos” and “pond_cave” in the database, so if you want to get an Eel without diving deep into the Caves, or want to farm Mosquitos without being in the swamp, you can use these instead of “pond.”

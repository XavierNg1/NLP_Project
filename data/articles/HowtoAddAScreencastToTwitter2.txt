 Screenr will then detect and search for Java on your computer, which is needed to run the screencast application.


If your computer does not have the most recent version of Java installed or updated, Screenr will provide you with a link to install or update Java on your computer.
 For example, if you have multiple applications open and displayed on your screen, use the drag and resize option to indicate and choose the application you want to use and record for your screencast.
 You can choose between using an audio device such as a microphone to narrate your screencast, or choose the "no audio" option.
 The record button resembles a solid red circle. You will have up to 5 minutes to record your screencast.
 You will then have the option to play and preview your screencast, or publish it to Twitter.
 Your Twitter followers and other Twitter users will then be able to view your screencast.

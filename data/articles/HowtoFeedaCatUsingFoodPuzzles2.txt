 As your cat gets better and more proficient at operating food puzzles, you need to try new and more difficult puzzles to keep your cat interested.You might try:


Puzzles with smaller holes
Puzzles that are opaque
Puzzle that don't roll as easily (like a cube-shaped toy)

, Another way to increase the challenge and keep your cat engaged it to mix other objects—such as ping pong balls, little toy mice, or other cat toys—with the food in the puzzles. This way, your cat might not receive a snack every time they get something out of the toy., You can also make it more challenging for your cat by simply placing the puzzles in new locations! Put puzzles in places your cat needs to work to access, or new and usual places in your house.You might try placing them:


On windowsills
On low bookshelves
Under furniture

, If your cat has become a master forager, you can make it a challenging two-step process! Select a large cat puzzle that can fit a smaller one inside. That way when your cat successfully releases the first puzzle, they still have another step before they earn a treat.

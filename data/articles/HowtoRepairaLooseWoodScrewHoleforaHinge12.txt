 Drill the screw at an angle, I.E. slightly up or slightly down. I have been fixing doors this way for twenty-five years and have never broken a jam or had the door come off again. Do not put the screw in at an angle more than 20 degrees or the head of the screw will stick out and prevent the hinge from closing (but you can file the screw down so it will not hit with an attachment that goes on the drill). I usually put the screws in at about a 10 or 15 degree angle so they will not prevent the hinge from closing.









Many times you can use longer a 3 inch, self drilling screw right in the old hole without having to go in at an angle. I have used 2, 3, 4, 5 and even 6 inch screws in old jams. Since I learned this, I have never replaced a jam. I buy the screws in one pound boxes but I use so many 2 inch, self drilling screws to fix doors that I buy them in five pound boxes.
Be sure and replace all three screws where the problem is so that it will really hold well (permanently).
With the self drilling screws and an electric drill, you can fix the door really fast (in minutes).

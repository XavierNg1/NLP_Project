 Remove the contents of each shelf. Use a clear section of counter space or pull a kitchen table close.;
, Use your judgment and remove any of the following:


Foods that are spoiled or too old or stale to eat.






Foods that are infested with insects.






Foods that you won't, can't or don't know how to use.
 If things besides food have slipped in, or if some shelves seem to be taken up by general storage, decide on new homes for these items.
 Allow the shelves to dry thoroughly. Take this opportunity to line the shelves if you wish.
 If anything has leaked or gotten sticky or oily on the bottom, wipe them off or (if necessary) repackage it before returning it to the shelf.
 If your shelves were a jumble of different foods, now is the time to designate shelves or parts of shelves for particular purposes. Put spices in one place, canned foods in another. If snacks or baking supplies are a part of your pantry, make separate spaces for those, too.

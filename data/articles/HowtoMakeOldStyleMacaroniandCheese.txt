 Keep it warm.;
,, As soon as the macaroni is in the water, start the next step (making the sauce). You want the sauce and macaroni to be ready at about the same time.


Be sure to stir the macaroni from time to time so the pieces don't stick together.
If you're going to put the macaroni and cheese in the oven to bake, you can remove the pasta from the water when it's slightly undercooked. It will cook a little more in the oven, and if it's perfectly cooked when it goes in, it might come out too soft.
 Melt the butter over medium-low heat, then stir in the flour with a wire whisk (this is called a roux). Turn the burner down a bit and let the roux bubble a few minutes (make sure the butter does not burn). Continue to stir to cook the flour a bit, but don't let it brown. Stir in the warm milk all at once, stirring vigorously with the whisk to smooth out any lumps. Whisk in the mustard and cayenne if you are using them and let the sauce bubble gently for about 2 minutes.


This is just one of the many cheese sauces you can make. For variation, try other cheese sauces like Make Mexican White Cheese Sauce.
White sauce (also referred to as bechamel) can also be made in the microwave.
 Some people prefer to rinse the pasta briefly to keep it from getting mealy (it removes excess starch released by heat).
 Stir until it is well mixed, then add salt and pepper to taste.
 If you want to bake the macaroni and cheese, put it in a baking dish, sprinkle more cheese or some buttered breadcrumbs on top, and bake it for 20 or 30 minutes at about 375 °F (191 °C).


The baked version is less creamy and has a crusty top.
To butter the breadcrumbs, heat up some butter in a small skillet and stir in the crumbs or make them in the oven as described in How to Make Buttered Crumbs.
For best results, Make Fresh Breadcrumbs.

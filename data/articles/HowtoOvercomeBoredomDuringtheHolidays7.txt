 Take along something to share and have a good long chat with them.
 Find out what you can offer, from making and serving food to handing out needed supplies. Getting involved with projects that help other people in need will give you a sense of purpose.
 Doing physical exercise like walking, running, hiking or cycling will give you more energy and quickly puts a stop to feeling bored. If it's too cold to be outside, look for indoor sports and exercise opportunities instead.

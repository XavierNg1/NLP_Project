 Mosquitoes use standing water as breeding sites to lay their eggs. On first glace you might think your yard is clear of possible breeding sites, but mosquito pupae and larvae can breed in very small and unsuspecting quantities of standing water (bottle caps).Look around your yard and drain or turn over any objects or areas that may be vessels for stagnant water. These vessels can include things like pet water bowls, saucers underneath plants, puddles near outdoor faucets, old tires, buckets, watering cans, wheel barrows, holes in trees, and depression or divot spots in your property.Consider hiring a professional to fill tree holes and property depressions.Clear out the gutters around your home as well as nearby street gutters.Any low points where water accumulates can become a breeding site for mosquitoes.If you have a pool, keep it chlorinated while in use, and drained and covered in the off season.Tightly tie down tarps covering objects and equipment so as not to leaves folds and depressions where water can settle, and mosquitoes can breed.If you have saucers underneath your plants, fill the area of the saucer with sand. That way, the plant can still absorb the water, but mosquitoes can’t use the standing water to lay their eggs.;
, BTI (bacillus thuringiensis israelensis) mosquito treatments are small, solid, naturally occurring bacterial larvicides that can be added to standing water unable to be drained, such as retention ponds, ditches, and rain barrels.BTI treatments come in a couple forms: BTI dunks can be added to open water where they float on the surface, and BTI bits can be sprinkled in gutters or wherever water tends to collect.BTI is safe for aquatic plants, animals (including fish), humans, and only kills breeding mosquito larvae., When they aren’t flying around, mosquitoes settle in cool, dark, damp, covered areas.Mow your lawn, keep trees and shrubs trimmed, and clear out any tall grasses or low lying brush.This will expose more of your vegetation to sunlight, which dry out any damp areas and make it less welcoming to lurking mosquitoes.Clear out any piles of leaves, brush, or decaying branches, as these dark, moist, piles become alternative and ideal places for mosquitoes to continue breeding., Growing certain plants in your yard garden can help repel mosquitoes. Plants like Lemon Balm, Lemongrass, Lantana, Lavender, Ageratum, and other mint-family plants are all good choices. These plants give off strong aromas that make mosquitoes want to steer clear.Citronella, Catnip, Basil, Lavender, Rosemary, Marigolds, and Geranium are some other plant options that can discourage mosquitoes from coming into your yard.Most of these plants not only repel mosquitoes, but make for attractive flowerbeds or outdoor table centerpieces.
 Use the cedar mulch in your vegetation and garden areas to keep moisture in the soil, soak up any excess moisture, improve the appearance of your vegetation, and repel mosquitoes.Since cedar oil is a common main ingredient in mosquito repellants, mosquitoes will steer clear from nesting near vegetation with the mulch., You can use a garden sprayer to treat yard with insect and mosquito specific replants such as pyrethrin and pyrethroid sprays. You can spray the underside of shrubbery in your yard or spray around the perimeter or your yard to create a barrier. Pyrethrin is a botanical insecticide made from dried chrysanthemums.Pyrethroid is a synthetic version of pyrethrin, and in some cases is considered to be a more effective repellant when compared to pyrethrin.There are also repellant granules that can be scattered across your lawn using a fertilizer spreader.These granules are normally infused with mosquito repelling oils. Typically, these granules are safe for pets and children.


These repellants can be bought at home department stores or online. You should check the packaging material to see how long the mosquito treatment is supposed to last; some treatments claim to last all summer, while other only last a number of weeks before another treatment is needed.You can spray your yard yourself with a store bought repellant, or hire a professional to treat larger yard areas. Professional may be able to better spray hard to reach places and may have different formulas that work on a variety of yard surfaces.Pyrethroid can be dangerous to other helpful insects such as bees and butterflies. To reduce the harming of these insects, pyrethroid spray treatments should be applied just before dusk, and on clear, non-rainy, non-windy days., Mosquitoes and other insects are attracted to incandescent lighting.To keep mosquitoes away and out of your yard, change your outdoor lights to fluorescent, LED, yellow “bug lights”, or sodium lamps.Replacing the bulbs near doors and entrances will especially help keep mosquitoes out of your home.
 Although mosquitoes account for only a portion of a bat’s diet, bats can eat hundreds of mosquitoes within an hourTo help combat the mosquitoes in your yard, buy or build your own bat house and attach it in an open, sunny area of your yard, about fifteen feet from the ground.Combined with other mosquito repelling approaches, a bat house in your yard can reduce the number of mosquitoes looking for a meal on your property.
 Since mosquitoes are very lightweight insects, a breeze more than 2 miles per hour can knock them out of their flight pattern.If you plan to relax outside, place a few fans in strategic areas (perhaps from behind) to blow the mosquitoes off their course and away from people.

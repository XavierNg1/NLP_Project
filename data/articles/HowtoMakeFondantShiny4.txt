 Use your fingers to carefully rub a thin, smooth, and even layer of vegetable shortening over the surface of the fondant.


If you want to keep your fingers clean, you could try using vegetable cooking spray instead of solid shortening.Hold the nozzle approximately 4 inches (10 cm) away from the fondant and lightly mist it over the surface at even intervals.
 After applying the fondant, use a dry paper towel to lightly buff the shortening into the fondant, working in small, circular strokes.


Any irregularities, fingerprints, or stroke marks should fade as you buff the fondant. Press lightly, however, to avoid leaving any indentations.
After you buff the piece, you should be left with a smooth, satin gloss.
 The gloss should remain intact for a day or so, but you may notice some fading once the fondant begins to absorb the oil. You can apply another coating at this point in the same manner used for the first.


Shortening does not dry completely, however, so some gloss will likely remain even after absorption occurs.
Since fondant remains wet and sticky, it's easy to accidentally leave fingerprints and other marks while moving the cake. You can remove these marks before presenting the piece by lightly buffing them out with a dry paper towel.

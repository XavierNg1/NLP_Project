 A person with confidence is very attractive to the opposite gender.


Feel your best by putting on your favorite outfit, styling your hair, and listening to your favorite music. Of course, you can only do this if you know in advance that you plan on asking someone for their number.






Even if you don’t feel that confident, act with confidence. It will appear the same to onlookers, and eventually the act will transition to the real deal.;
, If you practice a scene over and over in your head about asking for someone’s number, it will either 1) look equally rehearsed in person, or 2) work out differently in real life, making the practice unnecessary.
 Are you asking this persons number to call them up for fun? To meet them the next day? For a date in a week? Have an idea of what you plan on doing with their number before you ask.
 Although nerves can get in the way and make real talking seem like the most frightening thing in the world, it is unfortunately necessary for you to sell your charming self in exchange for a number.


Don’t expect to just walk up, ask for a number, and leave. You will have to do a little talking before and after the number-taking goes down.
Be open and honest. They may ask you questions, in which case your best solution is to be brief and truthful.
Don’t monopolize the conversation. Although it is easy to talk about ourselves, ask your potential partner questions and give them time to respond. Be a good listener, it is very attractive.
Know when to end the conversation. Although a little discussion is good, drawing it out for too long becomes boring. Make sure that you aren’t being too time-consuming in your conversations.
 Although you may know in advance that you want a person’s phone number, never stalk them to get it. Being caught in the act of creeping on them will definitely not put you on their good side.

 Your hair doesn’t need to be brushed and smoothed out for this braided bun. Tie your hair in a loose ponytail at the nape of your neck.Texturize your ponytail by pinching your hair at your crown to get some added volume.;
, Braid your ponytail in a classic three-strand braid. Braid your hair all the way down to the bottom of your hair.It’s okay if some pieces of hair pop out while you continue the braid.
 Use your fingers to create a hole in the area of your hair above the ponytail holder. Reach your thumb and pointer finger up and underneath your ponytail holder so they poke up vertically through the hole you just created.Keep your fingers poking through; they are going to grab onto your braid.
 Lift your braid up with your free hand and bring it to your two fingers poking out through the hole. Hold onto the braid with your two fingers and pull the braid down through the hole.The sides of your hair should be twisted since the braid was pulled through the hole.
 Fold your braid once more through the hole. This time, don’t pull your braid all the way down through the hole. Flip the braid to pull the bulkiest part to the hole, and let the bottom portion of the braid (the tail) fold over on itself within the hole.The idea is to have the bulkiest part of the braid be the majority of the braid seen in the bun.
 Hold your braid with one hand and use your other hand to insert bobby pins into the sides of your bun. Once the braid is secured into place, use your fingers to pull the braided pieces apart a little bit to make the bun look fluffier and to add texture.It’s okay if the bun looks a little messy and not too perfect.

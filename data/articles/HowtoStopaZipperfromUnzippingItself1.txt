 To fix your loose zipper, you can use a small metal key ring, about the size of a penny. Look for a key ring that is thin and durable.You can also use a small rubber band if you are looking for a flexible option. A rubber band can be good if your zipper tends to unzip itself and get stuck mid way on the zipper. The band can stretch enough to allow you to attach the zipper slider to the top button of your pants.;
, Slide the key ring through the hole in the zipper slider, usually located on the end of the slider. Make sure the key ring is secure on the zipper slider once it is attached.If you are using a rubber band, you can put the rubber band through the hole in the zipper slider and then loop the top part of the band through the section on the zipper slider to form a knot. You should have a knot with a long section of the band loose at the top of the zipper slider.
 Once the key ring is attached to the zipper slider, loop it over the top button of your pants.If you are using a rubber band, grip the long section of the rubber band and loop it over the top button on your pants.
If you are trying to fix another garment with a zipper besides a pair of pants, loop the key ring or rubber band over the top button on the garment, such as the top button on a dress or a skirt. Keep in mind this method looks better on dresses or skirts that have hidden zippers, as the key ring or rubber band will show if the zipper is exposed.
 Keeping the key chain or rubber band in place over the top button, zip up the garment. Then, button up the garment with the top button. Make sure the top flap by the button covers the top of the zipper as well as the key chain or rubber band. Your zipper should stay in place with the help of the key chain or rubber band.Remember to be careful when going to the bathroom, as you will need to remove the top button and then the key ring to take off your clothing.

 This will also help your nail polish stay on longer. Wait for the nail polish to dry before moving on to the next step.

, Use a strawberry red colour, just as you would do regularly. Wait for your nails to dry before moving on.
 Paint the outline of a row of about 4 or 5 triangles in white polish at the base of your nail. Then, fill in the triangles with the white polish. The reason that you paint the leaves in white first is to make the green absolutely pop.
 Trace over the white leaves with the green nail polish. Then fill in the design as in the previous step.
 Using yellow nail polish, dip a toothpick into the nail polish. Draw small seed dots on your nail, spacing them out fairly evenly (keep it as neat as possible).
 Wait until your nails are completely dry so as not to smudge the design. Then paint over the whole design with a top coat to seal it and to make it nice and shiny.
 Match your clothes in similar colours and you're all set to show off your strawberry nails.

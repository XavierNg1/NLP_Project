 Both wrapped and unwrapped mints are available at most grocery stores. Horses enjoy both types, and will not mind either. Try to get a mint that is sugar-free. If you cannot find a sugar-free mint, it’s probably okay. However, horses with equine metabolic syndrome, Polysaccharide Storage Myopathy, or Cushing’s Disease cannot eat sugary mints.If your mints are wrapped, be sure to remove the wrapper before feeding them to a horse. Over time, your horse will learn to recognize the sound of the wrapper and will get excited about its treat.;
, Feed mints to gentle horses. A horse that tends to be calm and gentle is much easier to feed by hand than a high-strung horse that tends to bite or that may be pushy to try to get the mint. Larger horses might be more intimidating for you at first, so you might also want to start out by feeding a smaller horse.


To get a feel for which horse is most relaxed, pet it gently on the forehead or nose when it is in its stall. If it doesn’t shy away, it is an especially docile horse and would be a good candidate to receive a mint.
Some breeds are naturally calmer than others.Clydesdales, for instance, are known for their gentle demeanor. American Quarter Horses are also typically quite calm.
Horses with a habit of chewing on human clothing or grooming brushes, or horses with a history of biting, will probably not be gentle when being fed by hand.Do not hand-feed a horse with these habits.
 If the horse you intend to feed a mint to is in an open pasture, you'll need to get it to approach you. You could use a verbal signal like “Mint!” or you could just make clicking or kissing sounds to get the horse’s attention.Do not bang pots and pans together or yell in an aggressive way at the horse to get its attention. This will only scare the horse and cause it stress.


Most horses will come to you easily if you talk gently to them and make kissing noises.

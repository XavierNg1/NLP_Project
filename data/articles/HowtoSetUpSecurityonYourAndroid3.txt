 To ensure that you phone remains secure, it is strongly recommended to keep your software updated. There are two types of updates that need to be checked. The first is the phone operating system.


Open the Settings menu of your device, then scroll down the menu to the very bottom and tap “About phone.”
Tap “Software updates,” which is at the very top, and then tap “System updates.” The device will check for Android OS updates. If there is one, it will begin installing.
When updating your phone's software, it is important to do it from a trusted location, such as at home instead of somewhere like an Internet cafe or coffee shop.
 Open Google Play on your Android device then press the menu icon (three vertical lines) at the top left. Select “My apps” from the menu, and a list of all installed apps will be displayed.


At the top of the list are all apps that require updating. You can either select the “Update” button across the app name to update apps one by one or tap “Update all” at the top of the screen to automatically update all apps.

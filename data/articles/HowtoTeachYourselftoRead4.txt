 The Literacy Information and Communication Service is an online resource sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education. By accessing their website, you can see a list of literacy programs in your specific geographic area. Many of the programs listed are free, but you need to read the details of each listing to be sure.
 Many libraries offer free literacy programs that pair learners or small groups of learners with a trained literacy tutor. These programs are free of charge and are typically offered on an on-going basis so you don't have to wait for a certain start date to begin instruction.
 Check with your local YMCA, church, public school or other community group to see if they sponsor a literacy program or if they can pair you with someone who'd be willing to help you improve your reading skills.
 It could be that you've had difficulties learning to read because you suffer from a learning disability. For example, dyslexia, a learning disability characterized by difficulty in interpreting spatial relationships or integrating auditory and visual information, is the most common learning disability and affects about 10 percent of the population.Having a learning disability does not mean you won't be able to learn how to read, it just means you may have to use special tools or customize the process by which you learn.

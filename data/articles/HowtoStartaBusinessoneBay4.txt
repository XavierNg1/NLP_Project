If you want to sell new merchandise you may need a steady wholesale supplier or drop shipper as your business grows. Initially you may be able to obtain enough new merchandise locally by shopping on clearance and hunting down good buys; but as your business grows your merchandise needs will increase.
Choosing the used, vintage and antique merchandise market means scouting out area flea markets, secondhand or consignment shops, auction houses, and estate and garage sales to keep a steady supply of unique marketable merchandise on hand.



Your customers want to have their purchase in their hands at a reasonable price. Because they have to pay shipping fees, they consider their bid price and their shipping costs when deciding how much they are willing to pay for your product. Heavy items cost more to ship; consequently, they may sell for considerably less than lightweight items that are cheaper to ship.
Damage caused during shipping is the responsibility of the seller. Not only is damage greater with breakable items, but the amount of time you spend packaging them and the money you spend on packaging supplies and shipping insurance increases.

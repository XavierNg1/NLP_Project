 No matter what type of fruit you're freezing, the flavor and texture will hold up best over time if you use fruit that's perfectly ripe. Discard fruit that's overripe and bruised, and leave out fruit that's not quite ripe yet.
 If you're freezing fruit that has a peel or skin, like apples, peaches, plums or pears, it's best to remove the peel before freezing. If you leave the peels on they'll toughen in the freezer, and once thawed they won't have an appetizing texture. The pits and seeds should also be discarded.To peel apples, pears and other fruits with a tough peel, use a vegetable peeler or slice off the peel with a paring knife. Remove the seeds using an apple corer or by slicing out the core with a knife.
To peel peaches, plums, nectarines and other fruits with a thin skin, use the following process: slice an "x" in the skin at the top of the fruit. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Boil the fruit for 30 seconds, then remove it from the pot and place it in a bowl of ice to cool down. Once cool enough to handle, pull off the peel with your fingers. Remove the pit by slicing the fruit in half and prying it out.
 Use a paring knife to cut the fruit into equal-sized slices for easier storage. Fruit frozen whole may freeze unevenly or get freezer burn, so it's better to cut the fruit first.


Small fruits are the exception; there's no need to cut blueberries, raspberries, grapes or small strawberries before freezing.
 Place it on the sheet in one even layer, so that no fruit is overlapping. This will prevent the fruit from sticking together once frozen.
 It's ready to remove from the freezer when the fruit is slightly frosty; it needn't be frozen solid.
 Scoop all of the partially frozen fruit in a bag or bin that's freezer safe. Label the bag and store it in the freezer until you're ready to use it.


Labeling the bags will help you remember what type of fruit is inside.
Most frozen fruit will keep for six to nine months.

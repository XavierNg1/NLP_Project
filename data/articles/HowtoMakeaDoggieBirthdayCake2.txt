, This recipe makes a small cake in a serving size suitable for your dog and a friend. If you have more canine guests, you'll want to double the recipe.
 You may do this in the microwave or on the stovetop. When the bacon is crispy, place it on a paper towel to drain the grease.
 Crumble the bacon into the bowl, and add the ground beef, cooked barley or rice, carrot and egg. Use a spoon to thoroughly mix the ingredients together.


You know best what your dog finds tasty. Feel free to add a handful of other vegetables your dog likes to "sweeten" the cake for him or her.
You could also add herbs for some gourmet flair. Add a tablespoon of chopped parsley if you know your dog likes the taste.
 Use your fingers to press it evenly into the pan. Use the back of a spoon to smooth the top.
 The beef should be fully cooked at this point. Remove the cake from the oven to allow it to cool, then invert it onto a plate. You may have to run a knife around the edges to help loosen the cake., Wait until the cake is mostly cool, or the cream cheese will melt.

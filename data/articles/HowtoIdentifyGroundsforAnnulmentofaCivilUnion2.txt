 It is an expectation of any marriage or civil union that the two parties entering into the union are open and honest with each other. If, some time later, it becomes evident that one of the parties withheld critical information from the other, the union may be annulled. Some of the grounds that would justify an annulment are as follows:impotence
sterility
criminal history
sexually transmitted diseases

, If one of the members of the union entered into the union solely to obtain permanent residence in the country, this could provide the basis for an annulment. The other party, the one seeking the annulment, would have to prove that he or she did not know about the immigration issue at the time of the union., A civil union, just like a marriage, is a legally binding contract between the two parties. As such, the same requirements for mental capacity that would apply to a contract apply to a civil union. If, for example, either party can show that he or she was mentally disabled, was intoxicated to the point of incapacity, or was in any other way unable to make a legally binding decision, then the union may be annulled.To obtain an annulment, the moving party would need to show that one of the members was mentally incompetent at the time of the marriage or union. This could be due to a permanent mental disability, or even a temporary insanity, if the moving party can show that the union occurred during a time of disability.

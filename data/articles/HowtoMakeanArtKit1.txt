 Choose something easy to carry around with you, especially if you want to do art on location or you are taking classes. You could use anything from a shoe box to an old briefcase.


Choose an ample container. You are likely to acquire more art supplies as you continue.
Plan to protect the supplies that are sensitive. A hard sided pencil case or simply a tin or shoe box can keep pencils and other delicate items from breaking.
Give some thought to how you will carry paints, brushes, and whatever you will use to clean them, especially if you're painting away from home.;
, Here's a list of what you might need with a rough estimated price. You will not need all of these items; just select what you would like to use and then build up your kit as you go along. You can always add to it later.

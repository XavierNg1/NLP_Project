 Pour about a tablespoon (14.78 mL) of isopropyl or rubbing alcohol directly on a rag or paper towel. Work the alcohol into the stain. Blot up any extra alcohol with paper towels. The correction fluid should come away with the paper towels. Immediately wash the clothes as you normally would.Rub with vinegar if you’re uncomfortable blotting the stain with alcohol., Put the stained area of the clothes over a clean cloth. Soak a second clean cloth in acetone. Tap the stain with the acetone-soaked rag. Use clean sections of rag each time you tap it because the correction fluid should come up with the acetone. When you’re satisfied the stain is gone, saturate the area with some rubbing alcohol. Finally, rinse it with clean water before you launder it.Wear rubber gloves when working with acetone.
Work in a well-ventilated area.
 Pour a generous amount of gasoline on a clean rag. Put an old clean cloth or absorbent paper towels behind the stain. Blot the stain with the gasoline. Once the stain is gone, wash out the gasoline by hand with liquid laundry detergent or dishwashing liquid. Rinse your clothing very well and then launder it.Take precautions when working with gasoline. Wear rubber gloves and work in a well-ventilated spot.
Dispose of your rags and paper towels according to the hazardous waste regulations where you live.
Try rubbing in some white spirit or mineral turpentine instead of the gasoline. Take similar precautions when working with white spirit.

Make sure the grinder is tightly secured to the bench.
Check that the tool rest is in place on the grinder. The tool rest is where the metal item will rest as you grind it. The rest should be secured in place so there is a 1/8 inch (3 mm) space between it and the grinding wheel.
Clear the area around the grinder of objects and debris. There should be enough space to easily push the piece of metal you are working with back and forth on the grinder.
Fill a pot or bucket with water and place it near the metal grinder so you can cool off any metal that gets too hot while you grind it.;
, Wear safety glasses, steeled toed shoes (or at least no open-toe shoes), ear plugs or muffs and a face mask to protect yourself from grinding dust.
 Stand to the side until the grinder reaches maximum speed.
 Move so you are directly in front of the grinder. Holding the metal tightly in both hands, place it on the tool rest and slowly push it towards the grinder until it touches the edge only. Do not allow the metal to touch the sides of the grinder at any time.
 To cool the metal off after or during grinding, dip it into a bucket or pot of water. Keep your face away from the pot to avoid the steam created by the hot metal hitting the cooler water.

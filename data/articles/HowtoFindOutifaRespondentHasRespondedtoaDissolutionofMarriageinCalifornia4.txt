If you aren’t the petitioner, the respondent might think this information is none of your business.
If you are the petitioner, keep in mind the following: If a restraining order or protective order exists between you and your spouse, in your dissolution case or in some other case, do not attempt to contact your spouse. Depending on the order, you may not even be allowed to communicate with your spouse through a third party. When in doubt, consult an attorney. Also, if a conversation about your impending divorce could lead to a heated argument or domestic violence, you should instead communicate through attorneys, mediators, and/or the court.
 If you are the petitioner, keep in mind the following:

Every divorce is different. Some ex-spouses consider each other a friend, and others can hardly stand to be in the same room together. Be honest with yourself about what type of relationship you have with your ex-spouse and if it’s a good idea to communicate directly about the divorce proceedings.
If you decide to communicate directly, speak respectfully and honestly. Also, try not to talk about the case in front of others, especially any children you share.

Affliction improves your damage over time spells by making them faster and hit harder.






Demonology relies on both shadow and fire spells. and relies heavily on pets to improve your buffs






Destruction is your direct fire damage spec. It relies on critical strikes and heavy hitting spells but has still got damage over time spells in the rotation.





;
, An imp (lvl 1+) is usually the best direct damage pet and also has a buff that increases stamina of party/raid members. A voidwalker (lvl 10+) has very good health, and is great at tanking whilst leveling in PvE. A Succubus (lvl 20+) is great at cc, and melee dps. A felhunter (lvl 30+) is good as affliction as it's damage is buffed with the amount of DoTs on target. It has a silence as well which makes it great for PvP. A felguard (demonology spec only) is the best AoE damage pet out there by far. Each spec has its go to pet, Affliction - Felhunter, Demonology - Felguard & Destruction - imp

, Have 3 ready before fights by using your soul shard gathering abilities.
, Keep your pet attacking at all time and have the highest possible DoT uptime for best damage output. elitistjerks.com/f80/ is a great warlock guide site for how to manage your specs.
 Destruction can be a tad lacking when it comes to speed but offers fun high hitting spells while Demonology got great pet utility that helps you control monsters and Affliction is simply great for survivability with all its self-healing possibilities.

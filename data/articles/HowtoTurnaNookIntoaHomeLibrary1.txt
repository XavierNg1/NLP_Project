 Estimate how many books you will have in your library and count how many books your shelves can hold. Not all the shelves need to be large or built in, because you can find many freestanding book shelves that allow you to stack books in tight spaces or on the walls themselves.


Make sure to choose bookshelves that either have adjustable shelf height or that have shelves of varying heights. Many reference books are taller than normal shelves.

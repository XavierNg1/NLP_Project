 It is best to choose a bag with multiple compartments to store different types of items. Some toiletry bags even have a hook to hang the bag up, which can be useful.
 Begin with items that are essential, such as a toothbrush and toothpaste, and deodorant. Shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner may be included, though some people prefer to use the products provided by hotels. Depending on personal preference, some other essentials may include face wash, moisturizer, sunscreen, and cotton balls/cotton swabs. After you pack the essentials, you can move on to other items like makeup.
 For travel, save a lot of space by just bringing basic makeup rather than several different colors of eye shadow, etc.
 Items such as hand sanitizer, a razor, and nail clippers can go in your toiletries bag.
 If a brush is really big, you can just put it in your suitcase.

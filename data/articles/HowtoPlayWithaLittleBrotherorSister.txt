 Going to the park? Bring your T-ball set along! Swimming pool? Bring pool noodles and inner tubes! Remember, in years way down the road, you and your siblings will want to look back on this period of your life and smile, because it was fun!;
, If they want to play freeze tag, and you want to play Truth or Dare, you can try to talk them into a game of whenever they get frozen in freeze tag, they have to pick truth or dare. Some siblings might stick to their guns only on what they want to do, however, so be ready to give in to them if you have to.
 Sometimes - as long as your parents are okay with it - spontaneous or random events can make your siblings surprised and happy, and will strengthen the bond between you.
 Let them win (on purpose) at games you play, but don't make that fact blindingly obvious. Make it look like you are trying your hardest to win but sadly lost!

, If they are little make silly mistakes while playing or ask questions like if you are running "What do I do with my arms?" Let them win!

,, Show them how much you love them by treating them to ice-cream on the weekends, bringing them to a museum with their friends, or reading them a story, kissing them and telling them how much you love them. If they know how much you love them, it will be less awkward and more fun when playing with them.
, Have them guess how high you love them. Example: "Do you love me to the roof?" "Higher." "Do you love me to that building over there." "Higher." And so on.
 Hold them close and tell them that you love them for always. If you're lucky, they might say it back.

 A 2-liter bottle will work the best, but you can use a smaller one for a smaller plant. Clean the bottle thoroughly with water, and remove the label.
 Remove the cap and set it down on a piece of scrap wood. Use a drill or a nail and hammer to poke several holes into it. The more holes you poke, the faster the water will flow out. Place the cap back onto the bottle when you are done.Avoid making the holes too small, or they may get clogged up by the soil., You can do this with a serrated knife or a pair of sharp scissors. Plan on cutting the bottom inch (2.54 centimeters) off of the bottle.If your soda bottle has a molded line around the bottom, you can use that as a guide instead.
 It needs to be deep enough so that you can fit your bottle halfway into it.Plan on making the hole about 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters) away from the plant's stem. If you are digging next to an established plant, be careful not to cut through the roots., If you have not already, screw the cap back onto the bottle. Flip the bottle upside down, and insert it cap-side-down into the hole. Gently pat the soil down around the bottle.


You can insert the bottle deeper into the soil, but you will need at least 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) sticking out of the soil. This will prevent soil from getting into the water., Leave your drip irrigation to do its work. Make as many drip irrigation as you need for all of your plants.

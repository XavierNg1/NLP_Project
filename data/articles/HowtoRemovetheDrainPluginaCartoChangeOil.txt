 Get oil and a filter replacement.;
, Get together a jack, a socket set and oil.


Park on a flat surface, or, if your car has a low clearance, use jack slopes or set it up. If you choose to support the car, use two jacks, rather than a slope. (An additional jack costs about US $ 20, this is a very small price and guarantees you'll avoid a serious over-balance and a car crushing your face. )

 Crawl under, and find the engine oil screw near the front. Where you plug in the socket, use the wrench to loosen the plug in a counterclockwise direction. Once relaxed, you can use your hand and remove the plug. The hot oil will begin to pour out. Ensure that all the old oil goes into the pan. Once it is completely discharged, wipe the screw and plug opening.

Remove the oil filter (use gloves if it is too hot) and wipe clean the filter area, especially when it is installed in the engine.






Dab rubber seal on your new new oil filter, and then twist it with your hands. You don't have to use the wrench to tighten the oil filter. # Add the new oil. Remove the filler cap above the engine of the car. Position the funnel at the opening point. Check the correct oil capacity in your car's manual, but typically, you will need to pour four to five quarts of oil. After it's full, put back to the filler cap.
 Check the dipstick. If you need, add more oil. Now check near the oil drain and plug any leaks. If you find leaks, simply screw in the plugs or the oil filter. You're done.
 Carefully wipe excess oil, old oil into a plastic container, and then deal with it. Don't just pour in any place, however. It is better to bring it to a recycling center or other authorized locations.

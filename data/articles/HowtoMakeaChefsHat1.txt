 Before you start working on the pleated, fluffy upper part of the chef’s hat, you first have to make the band that serves as the base of the hat. Use a tape measure to measure the circumference of your head so you can customize the hat especially for you and don’t end up making one that is too big or small.Measure your head by wrapping the tape measure around your head directly above your ears, where the brim of the hat will lie.;
, After you measure your head, add one inch (2.54 cm) on to the measurement number. It’s a good idea to make the brim a little bit larger than the size of your head so that it isn’t too snug.
 Take a piece of Bristol board, cardstock or stiff, white paper and draw a long rectangle using pencil, with the measurement that you calculated as its length. Decide how tall you want the brim of your hat, then use that number as the width.You can alter the band’s height to make the band taller or shorter, depending on your preference. Anywhere between 2 and 8 inches (5 and 20.3 cm) is generally a good height for the brim.
 Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut the rectangular band out of the paper. Try to cut in straight, even lines to make the hat look crisp and professional.

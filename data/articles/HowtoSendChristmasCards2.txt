 Write "Dear," or "To," and then, the addressee's name. This should go near the top of the inside of the card. Some people like to place the greeting above any pre-printed messages in the card., You don't have to include this if the card already has a pre-printed message. However, it helps to personalize the card with a short holiday themed salutation.


It can be something as simple as "Merry Christmas!"
If you want, write a little passage just below the salutation! Something like a poem, a short message, or a passage about the person works.
 These are short phrases or words that signal the end of your message within the card. You'll also place your name directly after or below the closing.


For example, you can use, "From, Your Name", as a closing statement.
Other closing statements to try include: love, yours sincerely, yours faithfully, best wishes, season's blessings, or even a few X's and O's, which mean "Hugs and Kisses"., People often include small things, such as photographs, with annual Christmas cards. This serves to update others on how your family has changed and provide more in-depth information that can't be written in the card itself.


Collect together a few family photos or school photos of your children to place inside the cards.
You may also want to purchase a gift card to a restaurant or store where the addressee lives to include as a more substantial item.
You can also write a "Christmas Letter" with more information about what has happened during the year. Most letters reference positive events, such as awards, family trips, or new jobs.Save some time by writing the letter in a word processing document and printing out multiple copies for each of the Christmas cards you'll send.

 Doing this will help to alleviate scratching.


This remedy is based on the myth that chiggers burrow into the skin, and thus sealing over the bites will cause them to suffocate. However this is incorrectâ€”chiggers do not actually stay under the skin, and are easily dislodged. Coating the affected area with nail polish or glue may help prevent too much scratching, but will do little to stop itching., Apply the powder to the chigger bite.
 After showering, apply the paste to your bites.
 You can dab Listerine on the bite, apply castor oil or spread on some Vick's Vap-o-Rub or Rawleigh's Medicated Ointment. The Camphor, Menthol & Eucalyptus oils in both will help stop itching and aid in quick healing of the bites.
 Mix water with any common household ammonia like a blue window cleaner. Use a cotton ball to dab this onto your bite, repeating the treatment as necessary., Blow dry the bite for a few seconds. The itching sensation should fade away after your skin releases the heat.

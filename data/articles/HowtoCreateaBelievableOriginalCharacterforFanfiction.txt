 Each fandom will have information that other ones will not need. For example, in Reborn! you will have to choose a flame type for your character, were as in any other fandoms, this information would not exist. Jot down all the things that you will have to consider when creating your OC.;
, If vampires don't exist in your chosen fandom, then don't make your character half-vampire. By all means be creative, it is your OC after all, but remember to keep your OC realistic to your chosen fandom.
 Don't make them a smart, pretty, athletic person who also saves kittens from trees in their spare time from saving the world. Mary-sue's (or Gary-stu's) are not the best way to blend your OC in, you want them to feel at home.
 This is an optional step, however it makes your OC blend in better if they have a past that other characters can relate to, since that in turn will help the reader relate to them too. Although you will need to be careful with this as certain canon characters will not be suited for your OC. For example, using the manga/anime Reborn! again, Tsuna, the main protagonist, is a meek, shy boy and would not have an aggressive older sister who likes to make people bleed.
 For this you may want to look at the canon character's friends and see what traits they like in a person.

 Shellac was a common wood finish before the 1920s; this may be enough to indicate to you that you have a shellac finish. Shellac is also the principal way to make French polish and has been used for this purpose on quality furniture over the past century.;
, Old or new, here is the way to check the finish on the furniture or woodwork:


Dab a little denatured alcohol on one section of the wood finish. Try to find an inconspicuous spot.
If it is shellac finish, it will liquefy and dissolve.A result of softening without dissolving suggests there is shellac present but that it has been mixed with lacquer as well.
Any other response and you're probably looking at a different wood finish. If in doubt, talk to someone familiar with furniture restoration.

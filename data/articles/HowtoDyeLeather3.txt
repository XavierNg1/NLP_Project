 Mink oil is a natural substance that lubricates and soaks into leather to condition it. Mink oil also has waterproofing abilities and protects from salt, mildew, mold and other elements.

Warning: Mink oil is controversial, since it can leave an oily layer that repels other products (making further polishing or enhancement difficult).Worse, "mink oil" products are not standardized, and may contain silicone or other ingredients that can damage your leather.Research product reviews before using it on high quality leather.
 Before dyeing, ensure the leather is free of dust, dirt, or other extraneous material. Use a brush or lightly damp cloth to remove any dirt or dust from the surface.

, Gently warm up your leather in the sun. Heating the leather helps the mink oil "pull" the dye into the leather, making it permanent and indelible.

You should never place your leather in the oven to warm it; it is very easy to ruin the leather.
 Place the bottle of mink oil into a container filled with hot water to gently heat up the oil. This will ensure an even coating of mink oil on your leather by helping to pull the oil into the leather./images/thumb/3/3b/Dye-Leather-Step-24-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-24-Version-3.jpg

, Use clean, smooth strokes from a oil-soaked cloth to spread the mink oil across the length of the leather. Give the leather an even coating to ensure an even finish. You may need to make multiple applications to get to the desired darkness.

, Occasionally move the leather back and forth so that the leather does not stiffen. This also helps to work the oil into the leather.

, For a pleasing, shiny finish give your cooled leather a buffing with a clean brush or cloth. Buff the leather by rubbing the cloth in circles.

, Be careful when handling or wearing the leather after finishing the process, as it's possible for fresh oil to rub off onto clothes, skin, or anything else it comes into contact with in the first few weeks after dying.

You may want to keep your dyed leather in a safe place in your closet until the dye fully sets to prevent accidental stains.
If you are unhappy with the shade of your finished leather, repeat this entire process as needed for deeper color saturation.

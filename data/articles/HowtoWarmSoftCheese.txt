 Unwrap the cheese, if it has a wrapper.;
,, By way of example, a 4.4 oz/ 125 g piece of cheese should be heated on Low (30% power) for 30-45 seconds, on average. For microwaves that run on high power, 15-25 seconds at the most should warm the cheese imperceptibly. The cheese should be slightly warmed right through.
 Leave to stand for 5 minutes prior to serving.
 Soft cheese should be given ample time to warm up to room temperature simply by sitting out.

 The paper should be no smaller than an 8’ by 11’ to allow room to write everything on the game board and allow enough room for the coin to move. You can use any coin, but choosing a silver coin may help to repel the evil spirits., This will allow the spirit to spell out answers to your questions. If you want you can draw them in a similar pattern to the Ouija board.Draw A-N arched along the top and the O-Z along the bottom. The shape the letters make on the paper would be similar to an oval on the paper.
 Some questions may require a numerical answer. You may want to find out how old the spirit is or when they were alive.
 These will provide easier answer options to simple questions. It’s always faster to ask a yes-or-no question than one that requires more explanation. You can use the start and end options to call a spirit or end the game.

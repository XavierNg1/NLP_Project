 This is done by fighting Heartless, Nobodies, pretty much any enemy you encounter.;
, Buy as many items as you can.
 If you haven't got it already, try to get the Final Form. This form houses the glide ability, which when leveled up to a certain extent, will undoubtedly help you in the battle you must face.
 In order to obtain Fenrir, you must find Sephiroth in Hollow Bastion/Radiant Garden. He is not that difficult if you are at least level 75 or above, have gotten every magic spell leveled up, and have your forms leveled up to an extent. The spinning technique and glide will help immensely here. You will need A LOT of potions/hi-potions/elixirs and equip berserk-this allows you to continuously attack Sephiroth when your magic is recharging. Do your best to avoid his attacks. Occasionally, this is impossible. One of his attacks will sap your health down to a tiny sliver. Use Curaga or quickly use a potion to escape instant death. If you need more help, do some research on how to beat him.

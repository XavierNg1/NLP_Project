 Coffee is a very effective at absorbing odors. If you have not had luck in getting the burnt popcorn smell out of your microwave, pour about 2 tablespoons of ground coffee along with ½ cup of water into a microwavable cup or bowl., Put the cup or bowl with the coffee and water into the microwave. Then microwave the coffee on high for 3 minutes. Leave the coffee in the microwave for a minute or two after the cycle is over., Carefully remove the cup or bowl with the coffee from the microwave. You should notice that the smell of burnt popcorn is gone. Coffee is not only very good at absorbing smells, it also masks bad smells as well.
 If the coffee didn’t work to entirely absorb the smell, leave an open container of baking soda in the microwave overnight. Baking soda also has strong absorbing capabilities and can once and for all fix your problem.

 Wrap the sauerkraut inside the paper towels and squeeze gently over a sink or bowl to get the excess liquid out.


Squeeze out as much moisture as possible. If too much excess remains, it can seep into the bread, causing it to turn soft and mushy.;
, Butter one side of four slices. Gently line the slices up butter-side down on a piece of wax paper.


The buttered side will need to be on the outside as the sandwich cooks, so when you assemble the sandwiches, the non-buttered side needs to face up.
If you do not use wax paper, you may end losing too much of the butter after you lift the sandwich up.
 Evenly divide the corned beef and place it on the bottom of each sandwich. On top of the corned beef, lay one piece of Swiss cheese, sauerkraut (1/4 amount for each sandwich), and roughly 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of prepared Thousand Island dressing., Butter one side of the remaining four bread slices and place one slice onto the top of each sandwich with the buttered side facing out.


As with the first half of the bread, the buttered side must face out to come into contact with the hot skillet.
 Add the butter and heat over medium until it melts completely.


Note that you can also use a shallow frying pan or skillet if you do not have a griddle.
By buttering both the sandwiches and the griddle, you create more evenly toasted bread with a softer texture and a more buttery flavor.
 Add the sandwiches to the buttered, hot griddle. Once the cheese begins to melt and the sides along the bottom look golden brown, carefully flip the sandwiches over and cook the other side.


The other side should also be golden brown before you remove it from the pan.
 Remove the sandwiches from the pan and slice in half before serving.

 Owning a car means that the car had to be manufactured and this adds to your carbon footprint. However, keep in mind that the total production footprint of your car is for the lifetime of your car. Therefore, the longer you drive it, the lower the impact will be over time. Start by adding between 5 and 12 tons of CO2 emissions depending on the size of your car.If you have a compact or economy sized car, then add 5 tons of CO2 emissions.
If you have a medium sized car, such as a sedan, then add 9 tons of CO2 emissions.
If you have a large vehicle, such as an SUV or truck, then add 12 tons of CO2 emissions.
 The amount that you drive your car each year can also have an effect on your carbon footprint. You will have a larger carbon footprint if you drive your car frequently. Check your vehicleâ€™s mileage and miles per gallon and then plug these into a simple equation.Use the equation: total miles driven / miles per gallon = total fuel usage.
For example, 8,000 / 40 mpg = 200 gallons of fuel used

, To convert the total gallons of fuel you have used driving your car into CO2 emission, you will need to multiply the total by a conversion factor of 22.Use the equation total fuel used X 22 = CO2 emission.
For example, 200 gallons X 22 = 4400 pounds of CO2

, Some utility companies will tell you what your carbon footprint was for the month. Check your utility bill to see if you can find this information. If not, then check your utility bills to find out what your usage was and plug the numbers into some simple equations to find out what your impact was.Multiply your kilowatt hours by 1.85. For example, 67 hrs X 1.85 = 123.95 lbs of CO2.
Multiply your natural gas usage (therms) by 13.466. For example, 19 therms X 13.466 = 255.854 lbs of CO2.
Multiply gallons or propane used by 13. For example, 3 gallons of propane X 13 = 39 lbs of CO2.
Multiply gallons of fuel used by 22. For example 15 gallons of fuel X 22 = 330 lbs of fuel.
 If you purchased any carbon offsets or did something to offset some of your carbon usage, then you can subtract the amount of carbon that you offset from your totals.For example, on tree can absorb a ton of carbon over its lifetime, so if you have a midsized sedan, then planting nine trees could offset the production footprint of your car.Check out non-profit groups that plant trees to help offset emissions. You can donate to have a tree planted and offset some of your emissions.

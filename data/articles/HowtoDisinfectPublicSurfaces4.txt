 Even a benign location, such as a library, houses innumerable bacteria and immeasurable squalor. Thus, a few precautions can aid in making a public experience a somewhat less repugnant one.


Any object, such as a keyboard, that has experienced constant fondling by unwashed hands, can be a potential dirt-magnet.

Using the keyboard example to represent such objects, one may begin the use process with a disinfectant wipe. The wipe alone, however, cannot remove years of accumulated oils and dander on the keys, so wearing a pair of gloves is an excellent means by which to avoid personal contamination.


If one wishes to reduce breathing in the horrible particulates located in previously inhaled atmosphere, such as pathogens and airborne saliva particles, a surgical mask is a lightweight and practical option.
 Often.

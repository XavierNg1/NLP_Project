 You can find them in the aisle dedicated to hair accessories, brushes, and combs. Usually, bobby pins are quite inexpensive.


Some women recommend buying higher quality bobby pins, claiming that they do a better job of holding your hair in place.If you cannot afford professional pins, try spraying your bobby pin with hairspray or texturizing your hair before using cheaper bobby pins. This gives them more ability to grip your hair., Start at your temple and slide the comb straight back along your scalp, toward the crown of your head.


A rattail comb works well for this because of its pointed tip.
You can use your index finger if you do not have a comb; however, you run the risk of not having a straight part.
 This pulls the hair up and away so that you can separate any straggling hairs from the lower area of your hair.
 Here are a couple of tips for doing this:


If you parted the section of hair on the left side of your head, pinch the hair with your left hand. This frees up your right hand to reach across to slide in the bobby pin.
Likewise, if you parted the section of hair on the right side of your head, pinch the hair with your right hand. This way, your arms are not getting crossed and tangled in front of your head.



Inserting the bobby pin in this way provides a better grip on your hair so that it stays in place.
 Gently wiggle the tip of the pin so that the arm of it grabs a few strands of hair., Then, lift the bobby pin and carry it over the whole section of parted hair.
 Put your finger on the rounded end of the bobby pin and wiggle it from side-to-side to help it grab your hair.,, This locks the bobby pin in place so that it will not become loose and fall out.Carefully clean up any loose strands that got caught up locking the bobby pin but are not actually secured in it.

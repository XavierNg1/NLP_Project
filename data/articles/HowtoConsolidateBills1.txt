 Bundling services like phone, TV, and internet can sometimes save you money, and it can definitely help simplify your bills, as you'll only be paying one bill for several services. You may be able to bundle utilities, insurance, and more. Look for providers offering deals to get you to consolidate and/or switch companies., The problem with a bundle is you can't always pick and choose what is included, so you might end up paying for something that you don't want and will never use. Compare the price of the bundle to what you would it would cost to pay only for the features or items you want and use., Providers often offer extremely low rates for the first month or two then hike the price significantly so be sure to analyze if switching/consolidating makes sense in the longer term. If the bundle deal only lasts for a limited time, reconsider the deal.

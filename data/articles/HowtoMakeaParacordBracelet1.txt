Pull the left strand around the right side and then around the back. It should come back towards itself., Using the strand you just pulled around, pull it over the loop you are holding on to with your left hand. Weave it over the two left strands and under the two right strands. Weave it over the right loose cord.You know have two "core" strands on the left and two "core" strands on the right.

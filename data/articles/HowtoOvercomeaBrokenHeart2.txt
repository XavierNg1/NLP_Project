 Losing faith in or being disappointed by a family member you feel responsible for or care deeply about can be a harrowing experience. However, for your own sake, it's important to try forgiveness toward this person.
 In many cases, the best thing that you can do is let that person go their own way and hope that blood ties will restore them to you when they're ready or over whatever has caused the rift.
 Talk to someone you can trust, and perhaps seek counseling if you're having a hard time getting over what has led to this broken heart.


Talk to other affected family members. A burden shared can be a burden lightened and hearing or learning about different perspectives of the situation may help you to see things differently.
 Reach out to this family member some time down the track when you feel able to. Realize that it may be rejected but be reassured that you have at least tried.

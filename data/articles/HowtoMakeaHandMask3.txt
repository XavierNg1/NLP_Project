 Add ½ avocado, 1 egg white, 2 tablespoon (11 g) of oats, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lemon juice to a small bowl. Use a fork to completely blend the ingredients and form a thick paste.Because the mask recipe calls for so little avocado, it’s the perfect use for any leftover fruit that you may have.
 Once the mask is mixed, slather it over your hands. Massage it in gently, and allow it to sit on your hands for 20 minutes so the avocado and other ingredients have a chance to hydrate and soothe the skin., When the 20 minutes are up, use warm water to rinse off the mask. Dry your hands with a clean towel, and follow up with your favorite hand cream to lock in the moisture.You can use the mask 1 to 2 times a week to keep hands soft and hydrated.

 Locate the app on your mobile device and tap on it. The Yahoo app will load.


You can also use any other Yahoo mobile app, such as Yahoo Mail and Flickr.
 This should be located under the “Sign In” button.
 Select “Recover your password” then input your Yahoo username in the field provided. Tap the “OK” button to continue.
 The next screen will show you several options on how you can recover your account by resetting your password. If you’ve provided a backup or recovery email address and/or a mobile number, these will be listed here.


Select the email address or mobile number Yahoo will use for the password reset instructions, then tap the “OK” button. Get the instructions or link from the recovery email address or mobile phone.
There’s no option to recover the password by answering the security questions on the mobile apps.
 The password reset instructions will direct you to a page where you can create a new password. Type in your new password, confirm it in the two fields provided, and tap the “Next” button.


You’ve now successfully set a new password and recovered your Yahoo account.

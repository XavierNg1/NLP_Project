 When dry-detangling your hair, you can use your fingers, a wide-tooth comb, or a paddle brush.


Using fingers can make it easier to find and work through smaller knots.
Combing or brushing hair can result in some breakage. Your hair is not very flexible when it is dry, so take care when detangling it this way.
A paddle brush is better for long, loose curls. It probably wonâ€™t work on tightly curled hair.
 Pin your hair into four sections so that you can tackle each section separately. If your hair is especially thick, it might help to separate your hair into more than four sections., Put a bit of lubricating oil, such as coconut oil, on your fingers. This will reduce any friction that your fingers may experience as they run through your hair.


Consider using argan oil to lightly spritz your hair. This will make it easier to comb through your hair with a comb or paddle brush. You can find argan oil at your local beauty supply store.
Consider wearing latex gloves to make your hands slip through your hair. You may also consider wearing gloves if you don't want to get the skin of your hands oily.
 As you start to comb through your hair, find where the thick and thin masses of tangles are. Separate out one tangle at a time. Pull the knotted area away from the rest of your hair if possible. If you can see it in the mirror, try taking a quick look to get a read on the situation.
 Run your fingers through your hair, working each knotted area one at a time. Start at the end of the chunk of hair. Work your fingers through the bottom of the knot. As your fingers undo some of the knot, work your fingers through more of the knot until you get to the root.
 As you finish detangling a section of hair, loosely twist it and pin it up. This will break up your work and prevent your detangled sections from re-tangling.
 Work through the rest of your hair, section by section. Pin up detangled sections as you go until all of your hair is detangled.

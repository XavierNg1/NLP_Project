 Excel 2011 will only save all of your sheets as one PDF file if the headers and footers for each sheet are identical. If they aren't each sheet will be created as a separate PDF document, but you can also easily merge these afterwards.Select all of the sheets in your workbook. Click the tab for the first sheet, hold down Shift, and click the tab for the last sheet to select all of them.
Click the Layout tab and then click "Header & Footer".
Click the Customize Header... and Customize Footer... buttons to edit the headers and footers for all of the sheets.
 If there's only a certain part of the spreadsheet that you want to turn into a PDF, select it now. Otherwise, move on to the next step.


Note that a PDF cannot be easily converted back into an Excel sheet, but this method will preserve your original copy.
 Browse to the location that you want to save the file at, and give it a name.
 This will save a copy of the spreadsheet as a PDF file.
 At the bottom of the window, you can choose between "Workbook", "Sheet", or "Selection".
 If the headers don't match, a separate file will be created for each sheet. Note that this will occasionally happen even if the headers and footers all match exactly.
 If the conversion process resulted in multiple PDF files, you can quickly join them together using Finder.


Open the folder that contains the PDF files and select all of the files that you want to merge.
Click the File menu and select "Create" â†’ "Combine Files into Single PDF".
 Open the PDF file by double-clicking it. This will open it in Preview, allowing you to review it before you send it off. It's not really possible to edit the PDF now, so if you need to make changes you'll want to make them in Excel and then create a new PDF.

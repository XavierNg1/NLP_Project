 Increase the thrust to maximum setting, retract the gear and flaps. You should be cruising at around 650 knots.
 When you're ready to land, align the aircraft so that the path you have drawn (the runway) is completely vertical and in the centre of your screen.
 Hold down the "Page Down" key to reduce your speed. You should lose thrust immediately.
 This slows the aircraft. This will also make it a little hard to steer. Increase the flaps to 100%.
 This only applies for the F-16.
,, For the F-16, this speed is around 260 knots. If you go faster than this, you will crash.
 Once you are about 100 or so feet above the ground make sure you slowly go down. This is the part where you are most likely to crash. While landing you may hit the ground and bounce up but just slowly go down again. Make sure you descend very shallowly.
 Should you crash, a box appears which gives you the option of exiting or resuming flight.


If you resume flight you will start again directly over where you crashed. Just repeat the previous steps.
 By now you should have landed but you're still moving. Just press both the "," and "." keys together and you will slow down to a complete stop in seconds. If you wish to brake faster, retract the flaps (by pressing shift + F).

 Sleeping while the car is moving is never simple, as you have to keep your seatbelt on and sleep in a seated position. There’s no one right way to do this, and it may take you a while to get situated and comfortable.


Take a reclinable seat, if possible. Many front passenger seats will allow you to recline the back fully. Provided no one is sitting behind you, this is the best way to duplicate a flat sleeping area.
Rest your head on your pillow against the window. If you’re unable to use a reclining seat, the next best thing for hanging your head is to use the window.
 The enemy of the road trip nap is the unruly driver. Shakes, bumps and hard turns can ruin your sleeping experience and leave you restless. Be sure the driver knows of your intention to get some shut-eye so they can drive accordingly.


Remind them that you’ll be doing the same in their situation if you plan on switching roles later on. This way they’re more open to match thoughtfulness with thoughtfulness.
Also check with the driver before covering any windows to block out the light. The driver may very well need those to check blind spots and the rest of the road. Sunglasses and a hat are a little more handy here.
Keep the music under control. You don’t want to be jarred awake by heavy metal after an hour only because you forgot to take the mp3 player off of shuffle.
 Even when you’ve planned, prepped, and done every you could’ve to ensure a long sleep, the unavoidable bump or uncontrollable car horn will inevitably interrupt you. Keep a positive attitude even when drowsy and cranky, and know that you hope your driving companions will do the same.


Bring along a sleeping mask to cover your eyes for sudden wakefulness. If something jolts you awake, you won’t be disoriented and jarred by sudden sun or streetlight. The mask will keep your eyes in darkness allowing you to drift back to sleep shortly.

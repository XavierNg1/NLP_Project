 Applying foundation and concealer will help to ensure a more even canvas for your highlighter and other makeup. Concealer can help to hide minor imperfections and brighten your skin even more. Take the time to apply your usual foundation before you begin to apply any highlighter and apply concealer if desired.








Use a sponge or makeup brush to blend your foundation well all over your face.
If you have any dark circles or minor imperfections, use some concealer to add a little extra coverage to those areas. This will make it easier for you to draw attention to the highlighted areas as well.
You can also use concealer to map out the areas where you plan to apply highlighter. Try applying a few dots of concealer onto the bridge of your nose, on your cheekbones, down the center of your forehead, under your eyes, and in the crease on your chin. Make sure that you blend the concealer well.;
, Take a blush brush or a kabuki brush and use it to apply a bit of highlighter from your temples to the tops of your cheekbone in a C-shaped curve. You can apply one layer for a subtle effect or apply multiple layers for more intense highlights.
 Get a bit of highlighter onto your fingertip and then dab it onto the tip of your nose. Move your finger back and forth to blend the highlighter. Remember that you do not need much highlighter, just a small dab.
 To accentuate the center of your forehead, you can sweep some highlighter down the center of your forehead towards the bridge of your nose.Start at the center of your hairline on your forehead and sweep straight downwards.









If you want a more dramatic highlighting effect, then you can sweep the highlighter all the way down the bridge of your nose, but this is optional.

 Use your dominant hand to grip the handle of the knife with your index finger and thumb on the blade. Your finger and thumb should be in front of the bolster, the thick part of the blade where it meets the handle. Try not to lay your index finger across the top of the blade. Gripping the blade will give you more control as you chop.








While you can still chop while completely holding the handle with your entire hand, you won't have the best range of movement.
The index finger and thumb should look like they're pinching the sides of the blade.
 The hand that's not holding the knife should hold the food that you're cutting steady. To prevent the knife from cutting your subordinate hand, curve your fingertips in towards your palm, so your hand forms a claw. Set your clawed hand on the food you're cutting, so the food can't move or slide.








This might not feel natural when you start practicing, but it's the best way to prevent kitchen accidents.
 It's important to tuck in the thumb of your helping hand, so you're less likely to cut it. The knuckles on your thumb and fingertips should be closer to the knife blade than the fingertips. This way, your knife will simply bump against the knuckles instead of cutting the fingertips if you chop quickly.








Practice keeping your thumb tucked in. If you notice your thumb sticking out while you're cutting, stop and tuck your thumb in again. Practice while going a little slower until it becomes a habit.

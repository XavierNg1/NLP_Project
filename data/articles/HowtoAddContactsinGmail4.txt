 If you use the Google Gmail or Inbox apps, you can quickly add senders to your Contacts list. Open the message that you want to add the contact from.
 If the contact has an image, tap it in the open message. If they don't have an image, tap the letter representing their first name. This will open the contact details.


You'll need to open the message before tapping the image. If you tap the image in your list of messages, you'll select the email instead of opening it.
 This will open your device's Contact list.
 You can select from one of the contacts already in your list, or you can tap "Create new contact." Tapping "Create new contact" will open your device's New Contact screen.
 Enter the rest of the contact information. If you want to save it to your Gmail contact list, make sure that you save it as a "Google contact."

 If lifestyle changes don’t relieve your anxiety, make an appointment with a therapist. Look for one who specializes in helping people with GAD.

If you have panic attacks, cognitive behavioral therapy can help you change your perception of them, making them less frightening.
 Medication can help you manage the symptoms of GAD while you treat the root causes of the disorder. Talk to your doctor about whether medication is appropriate for you.Medication doesn’t actually treat generalized anxiety disorder, but it does reduce the symptoms. This can make it easier to attend therapy sessions and make lifestyle changes that will bring you long-term relief.
Antidepressants, buspirone, and benzodiazepines are a few of the medications used to treat anxiety. Avoid benzodiazepines if possible. These medications are dangerous and life threatening and should only be used as a last resort.Keep in mind that medication should be a short-term solution. It will only mask your symptoms. It is important to get help from a therapist to find long-term solutions to your anxiety.
 Talking with other people who have GAD can give you a sense of community as you work on recovering. A support group lets you share your successes and learn how other people are managing their anxiety. Look for a group in your area, or seek out a support community for anxiety online.

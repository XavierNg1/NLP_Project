Don’t send him a wink because that really doesn’t tell him anything. And don’t just say “hi” and then expect him to do the rest. You’re online here; you need to do something significant. Send him an email. Make your move like a grown up.;
,


Chances are, he hasn’t yet seen your profile, so this is the first impression you’ll be making on him. Mention your name and mention what caught your eye about his profile. Give him a little insight into who you are.



Take note of what he has written in his profile and mention something about it in your email. Is he a meat lover? Does he go hiking for fun? Is he a single dad? Mentioning something personal demonstrates that you’re not just sending out a generic email by the boatload to myriad men.



Let him know that not only are you interested in him, but you want to hear back from him and you would potentially like to engage in a conversation at some point. The point is to let him know that you want him to take action as well, now that you have made the first move.



No one likes to read novellas online, so keep your email short, simple and concise. There’s no need to fill it up with useless banter because the last thing you want him to think is that you’re a chatter bug.

Once you have written to him, do not write to him again until he writes to you. If he doesn’t write to you, then he’s not interested, move on. And yes, he did get your email; don’t start creating drama. He’s not interested, move on.

You can download game templates for PowerPoint, Google docs, Microsoft Excel, or use one that a gaming website provides.These templates range from very simple to fairly elaborate. Do a little exploring to see what is out there.
You can also play Jeopardy games directly through some of the gaming websites, no downloading required.
 After you’ve found a Jeopardy template that you like, download it to your computer, mobile phone or tablet. Some template websites offer versions for all possible devices, while others cater to a specific device type.


These template files are not large, so download a few different ones that interest you.
You can experiment with several until you find the right fit.
 If you’re filling in all of the data yourself, start compiling your clues/answers. The template will likely walk you through set up, and each one is a little different.If you’re playing this game as a way to study for a class, use your school texts and notes to decide what the categories should be.
Select major themes or topics from textbook chapters to help you study for exams.
If this is a recreational game, you can decide on the categories as a group or devise some other way to come up with them.
 Remember, the higher the point value, the harder the question should be, so increase the difficulty as the point value gets larger in each category.If you need to memorize vocabulary words, use those as your answers.


The clues will be the definitions of the corresponding vocabulary words.
Once the template is completely filled out, the game is ready to play.

 Add the flour in one amount and stir quickly. Beat for a minute or until it forms a smooth ball and leaves the side of the pan. Allow to cool, however do not seal with cling-film or cover the dough as it may sweat which can affect the end result.;
, A food processor makes short work of the dough and makes a good quality pastry, however care must be taken that the dough does not climb under the blade attachment and leak, which it does quite often. The mix-master tends to give the best result, or hand held electric beaters.
 With a food processor this is about 1 minute worth of 5 second bursts, a mix-master takes about 4 minutes. If making a savoury version, add 1/2 tsp of salt or flavouring powders such as 1/2 tsp ground dried mushrooms, or 30g of finely grated Parmesan cheese. Ensure that your oven has been heated to 220C / 428F. You can do this by checking the thermostat or with an oven thermometer

, You may use a plain or a star or fluted nozzle.
It is best to fold the top third of the bag down forming a collar and then using a scraper or spatula to load the dough in, no more than 2/3rd the volume of the bag. Folding the collar leaves a clean top of the bag and when the folded collar is lifted up and the bag twisted closed, the filling does not come out the top. Squeeze by twisting the top of the bag further to increase pressure. Shake the bag gently to remove air pockets and then lift the collar up and twist to contain the paste.
You can also make your own by using a heavy duty strength snap-lock bag and snipping the corner off one end. Line your tray with baking parchment and you are ready to go. The dough may rest reliably in the bag for up to half an hour.
Pipe in your desired shape (see below sections for suggestions) and bake as follows.

 As you cut, hair will fall onto his neck and shoulders. These stray hairs can be itchy and messy., Typically, the lower the number, the shorter the haircut. Each number clipper corresponds to the length of hair that will be left after you use the electric clippers. Look on the instructions to your clippers to determine which clipper extension corresponds to which hair length.If the boy has thin or fine hair, you probably do not want to use clippers. Toddlers, unless they have thick, dark hair, probably also should not get a haircut with electric clippers.
If the boy has thick hair or dark hair, clippers are probably a good choice for him.
 Many traditional boys’ haircuts are cut with clippers on the sides and then scissors on top. However, some haircuts use clippers on the entire head. This will be a more uniform look than clipping around the sides and scissoring on the top.


If you plan to use scissors on the top, choose the place where you want to stop clipping. Pick a point where you want the clipper cut to transition into a scissor cut. Right above the occipital bone is a common place.Be consistent about how high on the head you want to stop clipping.
Mark the place where you will stop using the clippers with a washable marker, or just be careful to go to the same height every time.
 Place the clippers at a ninety degree angle from the boy’s head. Clip from the base of the neck straight up. You always cut from the bottom up., Make sure that you’re using smooth, even cuts and are not missing any little strips along the way. Start from the bottom of the head and move upwards, still holding the clippers at a 90 degree angle.
 You can now use the attachment-less clippers to “clean up” the area around the boy’s hair. You can use the clippers now on the stray hairs on his neck and around his ears and sideburns.

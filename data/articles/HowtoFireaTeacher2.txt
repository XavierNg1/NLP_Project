 Most states will require this, especially if the teacher has tenure. You can do this verbally, but you may want to consider giving them a written warning, depending on the severity of the misconduct report.


If the teacher is still within their probationary period (usually their first three years as employees) and haven’t attained tenure, it’s possible that they can be dismissed outright.If the teacher has tenure, terminating them becomes a lot more difficult. Unless they’ve done something lewd, immoral or criminal, they have a right to a warning and a chance to improve the bad behavior.
 If you want to make sure you’re understood, provide written documents with suggested resources and actions clearly spelled out.


Keep a copy of these documents in the teacher's file so that you can access them.
It’s highly likely you’ll be asked to prove that you provided resources and specific suggestions.
 Your school district and possibly even the state may have specific evaluation requirements, so familiarize yourself with those rules. For example, in Ohio, school officials must first schedule two 30-minute observations. During those observations, evidence needs to be gathered that supports the grounds for possible dismissal.In addition, the teacher must also be provided with written copies of very detailed plans for improvement.
Investigate your school’s criteria and follow it accordingly.
 Document everything – complaints, absences, what was found in the evaluations, and anything else that has to do with that teacher. If you’re intent on terminating the teacher, you will be asked to provide all evidence and information gathered. The more you have, the better your case is.

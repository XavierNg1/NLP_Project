 Go to your Samsung Galaxy device’s home screen.


The home screen is the first display screen that comes when you unlock your device.
 This is the file manager of Android devices, where all the files are stored.


My Files can be found in your app drawer.
 Go to the Media folder, which is inside My Files.
 To create a folder, click on the Menu button found at the bottom left of the screen.


Click on “Create folder” and name the folder “Notifications.” Press “OK” when you’re done.
, Look for the audio file in whichever directory you have placed your music files on your Galaxy device.
 Tap and hold on the selected .mp3 (message tone file), and then tap on “Copy” when a menu pops up.
 Long press the screen and select the “Paste” option inside the “Notifications” folder.
 You can now set the tone you selected by either going to Settings and setting the tone there (Part 1), or use the Messaging app to set the tone (Part 2).

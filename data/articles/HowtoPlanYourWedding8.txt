 If you have multiple venues, plan how you will travel from the ceremony location to the reception location. Some couples may choose to rent a limousine or ride in a classic car. Others like horse-drawn carriages. If it's popular with other people, book early. If it's your own cars, book them in for cleaning and detail a week before the wedding.


If there will be alcohol at the reception, do you have a safe way for you and your bridal party to get home? You may want to ask a friend or relative to be a designated driver for the night.
In some families it is traditional to decorate the coupleâ€™s vehicle, so if you have a nice car, you may want to keep it at home in the garage!

 The bowl that holds your ice cream base must be fully chilled so the cooling liquid inside it is frozen solid. Place it in your freezer until is completely frozen, which should take 10 to 22 hours.If you’re having a problem with the bowl getting freezer burn, wrap it in a plastic bag before putting it in the freezer.
 When the bowl is completely frozen, remove it from the freezer and place it inside the ice cream maker. Next, place the dasher, or mixing arm, in the bowl to ready it for churning., The ice cream maker should be turned on before you add the base so it begins churning it immediately. Carefully pour the base into the machine and place the lid on top., Consult the manual that comes with your machine to know how long it takes for the ice cream to churn. In most cases, it will need 20 to 30 minutes to reach the proper consistency.If you want to add mix-ins such as nuts, crumbled cookies, and candy pieces to the ice cream, you should also consult your manual. You’ll likely be advised to add to them just before the ice cream is finished mixing.
 When the ice cream maker is finished churning the ice cream, it will have the consistency of soft serve. If you like that texture, you can eat it right away. Otherwise, spoon it into a freezer-safe container with a lid and freeze it for another 2 to 4 hours.Make sure your container is airtight to prevent the ice cream from becoming freezer burned.

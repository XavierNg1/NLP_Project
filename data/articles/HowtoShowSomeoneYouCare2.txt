 While some people are quiet after a difficult event, other people will want someone to talk to. Make yourself available to them if they need a sympathetic ear, and be sure to listen to their issues. Don’t feel like you need to have any answers or solutions – just listening is often enough.
 Even if they do not take you up on it, offering to help out around the house can help someone going through tragedy feel less burdened by everyday life. You can even offer to provide company as they go to the store or complete their errands.
 Having a nice meal with someone is a great way to talk and show your affection. After someone loses a family member, for example, some people organize meals for the family so that they can forget about cooking for a while and enjoy a meal and some company.
 This can be big, from a surprise spa day with friends, to small, like going to the movie theater together. Even if you don’t talk, having your company will be enough to make the person feel better.
 Some tragedies, like the death of a loved one, take time to heal. Your friend might be angry or depressed, and they might lash out at friends when they feel upset. Don’t take it personally. Know that your time together is helping them feel better and be patient as they heal.

 You can select to add a dry rub of seasonings to your wings and let them set in the refrigerator for at least a 1/2 hour. Otherwise, season the wings with salt, pepper and paprika. If you are in this for the heat, sprinkle on some cayenne pepper.
,, Take the pan out of the oven and, using tongs, flip each wing over. Put them back in the oven for 15 more minutes.
 In a saucepan on the stove, melt 4 tablespoons of butter. Add 1 1/2 cups hot sauce to the pan. Stir to combine. Add 1/2 cup maple syrup or honey and 1 tablespoon ketchup as an alternative recipe.
 Take the wings from the oven and place them in a large bowl. Pour your prepared hot wing sauce over them. Stir to coat.
 The excess wing sauce will remain in the bowl to use later. Return the wings to the oven. This time they will cook at 350 degrees. Check on them every 5 minutes for doneness.
 Remove the wings from the oven once they have completely cooked. Return them to the bowl of sauce and stir to coat with sauce.
 Accompany the wings with celery sticks and a dish of bleu cheese dipping sauce or dressing. These side items will tame the tongue after its been introduced to a particularly spicy sauce.

 Flip the pineapple over and sniff the stem end. A sweet scent is generally considered the most important aspect of choosing a ripe pineapple. If it has no scent, it's probably not ripe.You can try smelling the pineapple from other sides; a sweet enough scent may be distinguishable from any side of the fruit. You should still be able to smell the scent from the stem end, however, where it will likely be strongest.
Avoid pineapples that smell fermented. Although you want the pineapple to smell sweet, you do not want it to be so ripe that the sweet smell has an alcoholic or vinegar-like taint to it.;
, Lightly squeeze the pineapple using the fingers of one hand. You want the pineapple to be pretty firm, but soft enough that it gives very slightly when you press down on it.
 A heavier pineapple means a juicier pineapple, because the extra juice gives the pineapple extra weight. More juice also means a riper, sweeter pineapple.


Note that "heavier" doesn't mean "larger." The pineapple should feel heavy when compared to others of equal size. If a larger pineapple feels just as heavy as a slightly smaller one, the smaller one is probably a better pick.
 While public opinion is conflicted over the efficacy of this method, some people believe that a pineapple is ripe when a leaf can be plucked from the top of the pineapple without too much resistance. If a leaf comes out too easily, however, the pineapple may be rotten.

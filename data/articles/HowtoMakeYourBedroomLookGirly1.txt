 Pink comes in a variety of shades — from hot pink to bubblegum pink — so choose a shade that reflects your personality. If you can’t decide between bright pink or muted pink, you can always mix and match.;
, Certain pieces of furniture are must-haves for any girly girl’s bedroom. For a classic girly look, white furniture works best; it’s versatile and it complements all shades of pink. Furniture in a natural wood finish will also do. Examples of classic girly furniture include:


A vanity table with mirror and chair.
A cute dresser. Your dresser can have ornate detailing or simple, clean lines — whichever you prefer.
A chaise lounge, if you have the space.
 Select white or pink accessories that coordinate with a classic girly theme. Classic girly accessories include:


Frilly or ruffled bedding. A pink bedspread is an important design element for a classic girly look. A matching ruffled or frilly bed skirt and pillow shams will further accentuate a classic girly theme.
Throw pillows. Nothing says girly like a lot of throw pillows. Silky, cushy throw pillows in assorted shades of pink are particularly girly.
Rugs. Choose one large rug in a shade that goes well with your bedding. If you prefer, choose two matching rugs — one can be placed at the end of your bed, while the other can be placed under the chair of your vanity or near your bedroom door.
Wall hangings. Hang photos of you and your family or friends in feminine frames. Other types of wall hangings that would look great in a classic girly bedroom include sculptural pieces or posters with flower motifs.
Lamps. Table lamps with ruffled shades in pink hues add girly detail.
Curtains. Soft, pretty curtains in sheer material adds a classic girly touch.

Stuffed animals. Arrange them on your bed or place them on your vanity.

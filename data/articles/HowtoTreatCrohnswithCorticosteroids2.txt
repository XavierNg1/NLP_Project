 Corticosteroids have been used since the 1950s to treat irritable bowel disorders. They are fast-acting when used for acute flare ups of Crohn’s disease. Acute flare ups are intense, sudden flare ups that produce severe symptoms.Corticosteroids are used to treat inflammation in the body.Because of this, you use the corticosteroids as needed, not to manage chronic, recurring symptoms.
Corticosteroids are used for symptoms including fever, nausea, and weight loss.
 Corticosteroids are meant to be a short-term treatment for flare ups of symptoms associated with Crohn’s disease. They are helpful in reducing symptoms after a flare up has occurred, but do not prevent flare ups.Corticosteroids generally are used for three to four months.Corticosteroids are given in the lowest dosage possible for the patient. Your doctor will only prescribe them for the shortest amount of time they are needed to help your symptoms.
You are not supposed to use corticosteroids often, even for short periods of time.
 Corticosteroids cause the adrenal glands to stop producing cortisol. Cortisol is the hormone produced by the adrenal glands in the body that is similar to corticosteroids. Taking a high dose of steroids can increase the likelihood of shutting off the adrenal glands, so you cannot just stop taking corticosteroids. That is why tapering off of steroids is recommended.Your doctor will taper you off the corticosteroids so that your body has enough time to start producing cortisol.
Your doctor will reduce your dose of corticosteroids over a course of a week or two.

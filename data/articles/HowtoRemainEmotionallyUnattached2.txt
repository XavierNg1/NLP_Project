 The sensation of holding onto something very cold can distract you from any negative emotions you are feeling and help you to respond in an unemotional way. Try sticking an ice cube in a plastic baggie and putting it into your pocket before you have to have an uncomfortable conversation.For example, if you have to tell a friend that you are upset about something she said, you could reach into your pocket and feel the ice cube to distract yourself from getting too emotional.
 Flavors can distract us from our emotions as well. Try popping a strong mint in your mouth whenever you are in an upsetting situation.For example, you could keep a couple of mints in your mouth before you have to meet with your boss. If you start to feel nervous, you could pop the mint in your mouth and focus on the flavor to take your mind off of the situation.
 Music is another great way to distract yourself from negative emotions. Try listening to some of your favorite upbeat, energizing music the next time you feel down and see how it changes your mood.For example, if you are feeling sad at the gym and you want to stop feeling that way, you could play something upbeat and happy on your mp3 player.
 Smells also have the power to distract us from our emotions. Try paying attention to the smell of the air if you find yourself in a negative situation and you want to detach yourself.For example, you might focus on the smell of brewing coffee if you are having an argument with a parent or your significant other.

,,, If you think that someone has misused your content, stay calm and don't overreact. There is nothing worse than someone rushing in accusing someone else of copyright theft and making threats. Be reasonable, sensible, and kind to begin with; sometimes people just don't get that what they've done is wrong and if you are rude or nasty to begin with, they'll get defensive immediately. Leave the legal action out of it for now! If you're a business, notify your legal team telling them the situation, but respond calmly.

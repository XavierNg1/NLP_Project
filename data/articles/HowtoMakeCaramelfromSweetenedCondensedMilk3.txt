 Open a can of sweetened condensed milk and pour the contents into a nine-inch pie plate. Cover the pie plate with foil.
 A larger pie plate or large roasting pan will do.Add hot water to the baking dish until it comes halfway up the pie plate.
 After an hour, remove the baking dish (with the pie plate inside) from the oven. Remove the foil and whisk the milk.


Check the consistency and color. If the milk hasn’t achieved the desired thickness or caramel color, cover it with the foil again and return the pie plate and water-filled baking dish to the oven. Top up the water if necessary.
 After the first hour, check on the confection frequently until it reaches the desired consistency and caramel color. Remove it from the oven when you are happy with the dulce de leche, or until it has achieved the color of peanut butter., As the dulce de leche cools, whisk it until it’s smooth and creamy, about three minutes.

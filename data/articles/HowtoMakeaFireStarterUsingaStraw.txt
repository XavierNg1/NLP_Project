Place a small amount of the cotton-Vaseline mixture at the top of the straw (the un-fused end) and then use your stick to push it down inside the straw. Make sure it reaches the end of the straw.
 Just be sure to leave enough room at the top of the straw so that you can fuse it together.
 Light the end to fuse it closed. This will seal the cotton inside the straw and provide you with a great, portable fire starter.


Avoid burning the straw end––hold the lighter a few inches (centimeters) away from the straw end.

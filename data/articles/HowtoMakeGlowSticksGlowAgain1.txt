 Crack the glow stick down every bit of its length. If no light at all appears, your glow stick is completely used up and there's no hope for it. If you can get a tiny bit of light, even just a couple spots, you've got something to work with.


The light in a glow stick is caused by a reaction between two chemicals. One is kept inside a glass tube. Cracking the tube breaks the glass and lets the chemicals mix and react.
Be gentle. Cracking too hard will break the glow stick and spill glass and goo that can irritate the skin.;
, Put the stick in a zip-locked bag. Press out the air from the bag, then seal it. It's unlikely that the glow stick will break during this method, but just in case, this will make it easy to throw away.
 For best results, stick it underneath a lightweight frozen object. This will freeze the liquids inside, preventing them from reacting.


Setting your freezer to a colder setting may help as well. Before you do this, be aware that this can cause excessive ice buildup or freeze liquids in an attached refrigerator

, Check on the glow stick after an hour and try shaking it and cracking it. If this doesn't work, return it to the freezer overnight and try again the next day. Most brands of glow sticks will get a little extra glowing time when the liquids inside melt and recombine.


Some brands will be quite bright, while others will just stay at the same dim level, but last longer. There's no way to tell what will happen without experimenting.
Keep it in the plastic bag while you shake it, just in case it breaks.
It can take a little while for the glow stick to warm up and glow again.

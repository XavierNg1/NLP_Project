 While you clean your kitchen and get on ant scout patrol, do some scouting work of your own. Can you tell where the ants are entering the house? Follow the first ants to see where they're entering and leaving.


Popular routs of ingress for ants include things like gaps in the woodwork, cracks in cement, vents, screens, cracks in the floorboards, and so on., Alternatively, you can use putty, glue or plaster. Temporary methods of blocking ant access to your home include petroleum jelly or poster tack.


If you use a temporary sealant (such as poster tack), only use this until you can purchase a more permanent solution, as it will deteriorate over time and the gap will open again., Soapy water will both kill ants and destroy their chemical trail. This will prevent more ants from following in their tracks.This cheap and easy method consists simply of:


Putting one teaspoon of liquid dish soap into a spray bottle and filling it with water. Add mint oil, citrus peels, or citrus rind oil to make this spray extra potent.Spritzing the ants you see with the solution in your spray bottle.

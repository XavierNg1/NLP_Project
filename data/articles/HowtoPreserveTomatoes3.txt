 Most ovens don’t stay at a low enough temperature to dehydrate food, but check to see if it can stay at a temperature of 135ºF (57ºC). If it does, arrange the tomatoes on a baking tray and dehydrate them according to this recipe.
 Leave the seeds inside if you want to rehydrate them as whole tomatoes or snack on the dehydrated tomatoes. Scoop them out with a teaspoon if you prefer tomatoes without seeds.
 Ensure there is one-half inch (1.3cm) between each tomato half so that air can flow through.
 Allow them to dehydrate for 18 to 24 hours.
 Fill to the top. You can also grind them in a coffee grinder to make tomato powder.

 Take a whole pear and peel it. Then core it with a spoon to remove the seeds. Finally, use a knife and cutting board to chop it into half-inch (1.27 cm) sized pieces.


You can buy seedless pears if you do not want to waste time removing the seeds.
 Place all of the ingredients in a blender. Then blend until smooth. Continue pulsing the blender until the smoothie is the desired consistency.If you have brewed your own green tea, make sure that you have let it cool down before adding it to the smoothie. Hot tea will make your smoothie runny.
 Serve the smoothie cold. If the smoothie is not as cold as you would like, place it in your freezer for a few minutes. Consider garnishing it with some orange slices.

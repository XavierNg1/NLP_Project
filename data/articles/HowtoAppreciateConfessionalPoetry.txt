Usually, the organisation of the collection is meant to show a particular period of the poet's life, from beginning to end.

 Reviews aren't meant to dictate your opinion of a particular work. Instead, they're meant to help you shape it, usually by revealing information that you may not have known or by bringing a different viewpoint that you may not have considered.

 Blurring powder is generally used to enhance existing makeup and help further smooth over any inconsistencies in your skin tone. Before applying blurring powder, put on your makeup as you regularly would. Once you're finished with your normal makeup routine, you can apply the powder as necessary., Blurring powder sometimes gets stuck on the bottom of the container. This is especially true if the container is new. To loosen the powder for use, shake the container lightly before opening it. When opened, there should be a light layer of blurring powder on top of the container., Dab a pad or makeup brush into the container, getting a light dusting of blurring powder on the pad or brush. Then, gently dab the powder onto your face. Use brief, patting motions throughout your face to apply the powder. You should apply a layer of blurring powder over all your regular makeup. This should make your makeup look more even.If your makeup looks particularly uneven or sparse in certain areas, target these areas a little more when applying blurring powder.
Make sure to use gentle motions. Moving too fast can cause blurring powder to create dust, which can cause sneezing and coughing., After you're done applying powder, examine your face. Some blurring powder is very sheer, and your face may not look much different after the first layer. If you believe it is necessary, add another layer of blurring powder. You can also simply add a layer on areas that look particularly sparse, like your chin or forehead.

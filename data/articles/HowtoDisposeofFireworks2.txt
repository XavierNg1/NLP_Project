 After your firework show, comb the area for any pieces that may have scattered in the explosion. Watch the fireworks as they fall to the ground, and mark their locations so that you don't miss anything. If you leave a piece of burning material on the ground, you might start a fire! Furthermore, fireworks often contain metals and other materials that can pollute an ecosystem and contaminate the water table.Do your part to minimize your impact.
 Use trash bags, Ziploc, or plastic wrap so that the wet explosives don't dry out.Consider double-wrapping the bags. It's okay to put multiple fireworks in the same bag, as long as it is sealed.
 Fireworks cannot be recycled or composted.If possible, bring the fireworks to your local solid waste center. Make sure to tell the workers at the waste center that you are disposing of fireworks â€“ and whether they are live, spent, or duds.


If you don't feel comfortable placing fireworks in the garbage, contact your local fire department. Some police and fire authorities will take fireworks and ensure proper disposal. This applies especially to live fireworks.

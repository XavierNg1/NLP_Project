 Google AdWords is one of the leading pay-per-click ad services available on the Internet. You only pay for the ad when people click on it and visit your website, making it a fairly cost effective means of advertisement.


Get started by calling 1-800-919-9922 or by visiting https://www.google.com/adwords/

When you sign up, you'll choose a daily budget you're willing to pay along with the maximum bid you are willing to make for each prospective click. A larger bid will put your ad further up in the search results page. You are not charged for the number of times your ad is displayed, however; you only receive a charge when your ad is clicked.
You'll choose search terms that apply to your ad as you create it. When people search those terms, your ad appears next to or above the search results.;
, While Google is still the most popular search engine, Bing has its own set of followers, and as such, it can be beneficial to purchase space through Bing Ads, as well.


The service provided through Bing is pay-per-click, just like Google AdWords is.

When starting out, you can also sign up for free coaching, which will lead you through the process step-by-step.
On the website, you will get started by creating an advertising campaign. You'll set keywords that match the content of your ad, and whenever a person inputs those keywords into the Bing search engine, your ad will appear somewhere along the top or side of the results.
Ad space is limited, so you will need to place a bid for space. A higher bid will buy you a better slot within the search results.
The bid price you set will be the price you pay each time an ad is clicked. You will only pay when someone clicks on your ad.
You will also be asked to set an overall budget for your advertising campaign. You can set a budget for a daily or monthly basis.

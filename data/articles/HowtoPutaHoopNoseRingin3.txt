 The segment is held in place with prongs and pressure. By pushing it to the side, you ease the pressure off, freeing the prongs and making it easier to detach. Hold the hoop with the segment positioned on top. Grab the segment with your index finger and thumb of one hand, while steadying the bottom of the ring with the other hand. Gently push the segment to one side until it pops out.


Do not try to yank the segment straight out. If you try to remove the segment without releasing the pressure first, you may snap the prongs off.
 Feed one end of the main hoop through your nose piercing. Continue feeding the hoop through the hole, until the bottom is centered inside the piercing and the opening lies directly below it.
 Push one end of the segment onto one end of the ring, while gently twisting the other end of the ring to the side. Widen the gap as you twist. Once one end of the segment is secure, twist the unattached end of the ring back towards the segment.


Remember to make the opening a little larger. If not, you may not be able to snap the segment on completely or evenly.
Do not pull the ring apart sideways.
Do not twist the ends apart any further than necessary to snap the segment back in place.
 Push the prong in to completely secure the segment. Once this is done, the hoop should be safely tucked into the piercing and ready to wear.
 Placing the segment back on is much more difficult than taking it out. You might find it easier to use your hands with smaller gauges, like a 20 or 18 gauge. For 16, 14 and thicker gauges you may need to use opening/closing pliers.

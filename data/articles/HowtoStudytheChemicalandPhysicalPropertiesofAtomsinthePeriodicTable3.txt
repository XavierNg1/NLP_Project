 Nonmetals exist in three physical states at room temperature (solid, liquid, and gas), but are primarily gases at room temperature. Nonmetals are usually dull and brittle when they are solid, and they typically melt and boil at lower temperatures than metals. Nonmetals are also poor conductors of heat and electricity.The only nonmetal that is a liquid at room temperature is bromine.
Carbon has the highest melting point of all elements.
 Metals are shiny and malleable. They also conduct heat and electricity well. Metals are mostly solid at room temperature, though mercury is a liquid. Metals generally have high melting and boiling points compared to nonmetals., The elements that make up the far right column are known as the noble gases. They are chemically inert and are all found in the gas phase at room temperature. These gases are used for things like filling balloons and lighting signs.
 Just like metalloids possess chemical properties of both metals and nonmetals, they possess physical properties of both. They are semi-conductors. They can be malleable or brittle. They can also be shiny or dull.

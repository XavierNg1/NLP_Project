 Curly kale is the most common variety of kale, so if you have never tried it before, then you might want to start here.Curly kale has a crunchy texture and slightly bitter taste, but you can season it and add it to lots of different recipes.


This type of kale is widely available in the fresh produce sections of grocery stores, so you should have no problem finding it.
 If you want to try something a little more exotic, then you might want to try lacinato kale.This type of kale is also known as dinosaur kale, Tuscan kale and black kale.It has wrinkly, dark blue-green leaves, that are more tender than curly kale, and the flavor is a little sweeter and earthier than curly kale as well.


Since the leaves and stems of lacinato kale are so tender, this is a good type of kale to enjoy raw, such as in a salad.
 Red Russian kale is even sweeter than lacinato kale. This kind of kale is a bit harder to find, so you might need to check out a farmers’ market or a health food store.Make sure that you remove the stems completely if you decide to try red Russian kale, they are very tough and woody, which may upset your stomach.

 Purple and white kale are even harder to find, but they are really pretty varieties. These types of kale have a cabbage-like flavor, so they are not the most flavorful.Try checking out your local farmers’ market or health food store to see if they have any red or purple kale.

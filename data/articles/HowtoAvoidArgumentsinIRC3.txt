 The op can then take action by telling the people in question to stop arguing. If the people in question ignore the ops, the ops may step in and use controls, such as silencing or kicking.
 Arguments continue when someone adds flames to the fire, or when they put their opinions into the situation. The IRC command to ignore someone is /ignore . When you ignore someone, you are unable to see what they are writing, but they and everyone else can see what you are writing.

It can be useful to state that you are refusing to continuing to engage with the challenger until they return to speaking civilly. This puts the challenger on alert that you really mean what you say, then you can use the ignore command and really do what you said you would.
 Be the stronger person and show others that the challenger is not getting to you. Have fun chatting with others... isn't that the purpose of being in a chat room? When the challenger sees you not give in to what they are saying, they might drop the fight or leave the chat room themselves. When they do, pat yourself on the back.

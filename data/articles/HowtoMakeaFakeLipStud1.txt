 Rhinestones with a flatback are not a necessity but will stick much nicer than rounded-back rhinestones, simply because the skin under your lip is flat.This allows the rhinestones to be flush with your skin.


Don’t limit yourself to the beauty store. Check your local craft store for an endless supply of rhinestones.;
, When choosing a rhinestone, it may be best to purchase a variety pack. This allows you to test several sizes on your face before committing to one.For example, a 5 mm rhinestone may seem like a wise choice but may actually be too large for your face.


Try a 2.5 mm or 3 mm rhinestone. This compares in size to some real lip studs without looking gaudy or overdone.
 Use a semi permanent marker to play with location of your fake lip stud. Experiment to see if you would prefer the middle, a side, both sides, your top lip or your bottom lip.If you want both sides of your lip to have a fake stud, place a strip of tape below where you want to mark your face. This ensures even marking.
 When your lip stud eventually falls off, your skin may be left feeling tacky and gross if you’ve used spirit gum as an adhesive.In order to prevent this, pick up a spirit gum remover.The remover will wash away any remaining tackiness or dryness from the glue.

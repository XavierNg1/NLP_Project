 A 2-liter soda bottle will work the best, but if you are only watering a small plant, you may be able to use a smaller one. Clean the bottle thoroughly inside-out with water and remove the label., Focus on making the holes in the bottom two-thirds of the bottle. You can make as many or as few holes as you want; the more you make, the faster the water will flow. If you are only going to be watering one plant, place the holes on the same side of the bottle.Make the holes using a nail or a metal skewer.
You may have to heat the nail or skewer up over a flame first.
 This is very important as it will allow the water from collecting in the bottom and growing stagnant. If your bottle has a segmented bottom (ie: most 2-liter soda bottles), you will need to poke a hole in each segment.The bottom of most bottles is typically made from thicker plastic. You will need to use a drill or a hot nail to do this.
 The hole needs to be deep enough to insert the bottle about two-thirds of the way, or where the straight walls start to curve into a dome., If you places the holes on one side of the bottle, rotate the bottle until the holes face the plant. Gently pat the soil around the bottle., Remove the cap first, then use a hose to fill the bottle with water; you can also insert a funnel into the neck to make filling easier. Leave the cap off, otherwise the water won't flow out.

If the water is flowing out too fast, you can put the cap on loosely. The tighter you close it, the slower the water will flow out.You can also cut the top, domed portion of the bottle off, invert it, and use it like a funnel.

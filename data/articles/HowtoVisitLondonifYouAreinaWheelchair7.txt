 All but a few buses are fitted with ramps, so you can travel by bus pretty easily. This requires a little explanation though:


The wheelchair ramp is located underneath the exit door, so as soon as the bus stops, that is where you need to go.
Anyone who can get off the bus independently, does so. Then the doors close, and you´ll probably think the bus is leaving without you. But no. You will hear a signal, and see the ramp appear from underneath the bus. The doors will open again and you can get on. Opposite the door there is a wheelchair space. Position yourself in it and put the brakes on.
As soon as the bus approaches the end of your journey, press the blue button. The driver will know that you want to get off. The doors will open to let the other passengers off, then close again. You´ll hear the same sound you heard earlier, and see the ramp slide out. The doors will open and you can leave the bus.

 These and other cardio-intensive exercises will help you burn calories, speed up your metabolism, and improve your cardiovascular health.


Do 30 minutes of cardio at least 3-5 times a week.
If you are a gym member, try the elliptical trainer, stationary bike, and other cardio equipment your gym has available.
 Not everybody loves to run. Try out different exercises and commit to the one you enjoy the most. This way, you'll be more likely to stick with it.
 If you are easily bored with cardio, try switching up your workout.


Instead of running every day, alternate running and biking every other day.
Alternate within a single workout. For example, at the gym you can run the treadmill for 10 minutes, bike for ten minutes, then use the elliptical for ten minutes. This will make your 30 minute workout feel a lot shorter.
 Most gyms offer spinning, cardio kickboxing, Zumba, and more. Working out with a group will push you harder than you push yourself, especially if you are new to exercising.
 Not all exercise has to feel like work. If you're not in the mood to work out, put on some music and dance, dance, dance like no one's watching.



Walk to your destination instead of driving. If you drive somewhere, park further away than you normally do.
Do chores around the house. These burn more calories than you'd think!
If you work a desk job, make sure you are standing up and walking around every couple of hours. Use your break time to go for a brisk walk outside.

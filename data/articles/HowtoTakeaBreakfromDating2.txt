 Finding new things you love to do can open you up to other people when you are ready to start dating again, and can provide stress relief and calmness to your busy life.
 Tell yourself that you will stay single for, say, 6 months before you get back in the game. Now, being single doesn't mean you can't have fun -- you can still flirt and have a good time, just don't get yourself into a long-term commitment if you aren't ready.


If you find someone who really makes you happy and you think you are ready to start dating after a little while, that's totally okay! You wouldn't want to miss out on a great opportunity if you feel you are ready for it.
 When you're constantly dating, it can be hard to focus on your platonic friends if you are so caught up in your partner. Making new friendships and rekindling old ones can help you figure out the type of people you like to hang out with and the things you like to do when you are with them.
 If the goal of taking a break from dating is to get to know yourself better, spending some time alone can help you figure out who you are and what you want out of all areas of your life, not just your romantic partner.

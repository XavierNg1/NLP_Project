 It is unlikely that a publication will choose to feature your column if you are not already an experienced and published writer. If you do not have these credentials, work as a freelance writer and get several pieces of your writing published before pitching a long-term writing project to anyone. Aim to get your work printed in publications that would also feature regular humor columns; the publications that have featured you should be similar to the ones you pitch your column to down the line., Aside from the humor factor, you should make sure that your writing is polished and grammatically accurate if you want your column to be published. Edit all of your work – leave time to put a column aside and proofread it a day or two later. Be especially diligent about checking all sample articles that you submit with your proposal. If you feel it to be necessary, have someone close to you proofread your work before submitting it., The proposal you write to a publication regarding your humor column should be as captivating as you intend your column to be. Avoid a generic introductory statement like, “I am writing to you to submit my proposal for a humor column in your publication” – instead, opt for something more distinctive and memorable, like, “I am writing to you in the hopes that you will consider adding a weekly column to your publication that, in my very humble opinion, is hilarious.” Maintain a confident and humorous tone throughout the proposal letter.Unless you already know the person you are submitting a proposal to, communication by email is the best option.

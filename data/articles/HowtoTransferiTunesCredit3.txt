You can also choose to send the allowance now or wait till the first of next month., If the recipient already has an Apple ID setup, you can send the allowance to that account by entering their email synced to that account. If they do not have an Apple ID, you’ll need to create one for them.This is also where you can write a personal message like, “Happy Bat Mitzvah Alice! Now you can enjoy iTunes credits all year long."

, On the confirmation page you’ll see an overview of the allowance. You can edit any information about your purchase here before sending it. Once everything looks good to you, confirm the purchase by clicking “Buy.”


You should also receive a confirmation email through the email you used for your Apple ID account.
You can also edit or cancel the allowance through the “Allowance” section under “Gift Cards” in the iTunes store.

 If you're making a single-layer fleece blanket, which will have a right side and a wrong side; you need just enough fabric for one layer. If you'd like to make a reversible fleece blanket, which can be used with either side up, you need enough fleece for two complete blanket-sized layers.









The following size blankets will cover the top of a bed. Add a 1/2 (1.27 centimeters) - to - 1-inch (2.5 centimeters) seam allowance on all sides if you intend to stitch the edges, and don't count the selvage (machine-finished edge of the fabric) as part of the pattern:
Crib: 27 inches (68.58 centimeters) by 52 inches (132.08 centimeters)
Twin: 39 inches (99.06 centimeters) by 74 inches (187.96 centimeters)
Full: 54 inches (137.16 centimeters) by 74 inches (187.96 centimeters)
Queen: 60 inches (152.4 centimeters) by 80 inches (203.2 centimeters)
King: 78 inches (198.12 centimeters) by 80 inches (203.2 centimeters);
, Trim along the line with scissors or lay the fleece flat on a cutting board and place a straight, solid cutting guide along the edge you intend to cut. Guide a rotary cutter down cutting guide, slicing through the fabric. You can also cut the fleece with pinking scissors, which automatically creates a somewhat finished-looking edge.









Make sure the surface beneath you blanket is safe to possibly harm. You don't want to go leaving cuts on a nice table or countertop.

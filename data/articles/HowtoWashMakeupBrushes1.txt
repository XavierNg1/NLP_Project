 You can place the sponge in a large bowl to make for easier cleanup. You shouldn't need more than a dime-sized amount of shampoo, since a little goes a long way.


Make sure the sponge you use is either brand new or squeaky clean. Don't use a sponge that's already been used to wash your dishes; you'll just transfer the bacteria to your brushes.
You can use a mild body wash or face cleanser in place of baby shampoo. There are also special soaps you can buy for the purpose of cleaning brushes.;
, This will work up a slight lather and help the soap saturate your brushes. Don't press too hard, since you don't want to damage the bristles; just lightly rub the brushes over the sponge in a circular motion.


Try not to get soap into the barrel of the brush, where the bristles are attached to the handle. Getting soap and water in there can cause the glue to loosen and the bristles to fall off.
If you're cleaning a lot of brushes, you might want to start with just two or three, then rinse the sponge and change out the soap.
 Hold them under the faucet to rinse off the soap. Rotate the brushes to make sure all the soap gets rinsed off. Again, make sure you don't get too much water into the barrel of the brush; focus on running water over the bristles, and not the upper part of the brush.Use warm, not hot, water. Hot water can loosen the glue and damage the bristles.
If you still see residue after rinsing, clean and rinse the brushes again.
 Place them on a clean towel and spread them out so there's no overlap. Let the brushes dry completely before you use them again. If you clean your brushes in the evening, they should be dry by morning.


If you have a brush with a specific shape, such as a fan, gently reshape the bristles before laying it out to dry.
Do not use a hair dryer to speed along the drying process. The heat can damage the glue holding the bristles in place and cause them to fall out.

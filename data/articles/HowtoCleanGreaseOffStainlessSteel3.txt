 In a bowl, combine equal parts baking soda and water. Mix the two together until they form a paste., Apply the baking soda mixture by spreading it with a spoon or soft cloth without scrubbing it into the steel. Come back after 15 minutes.
 An old toothbrush will suffice if you don’t have a nylon brush. Remember the orientation of the steel's grain and scrub back and forth along it., Place the stainless steel under warm, running water if possible or use a damp cloth to remove the baking soda cleaner. Check to see if the stain has gone away.
 If the stain persists, pour vinegar straight from the bottle. Vinegar is acidic and can help remove the stain, so use the undiluted variety for the best results.


When working with pots and pans, you can also try adding a half a cup of water and a sprinkle of baking soda to the vinegar before heating the mixture to a simmer on the stove for 20 minutes., Use your nylon brush or old toothbrush to move along the grain. Be gentle to avoid causing scratches., Again, place the stainless steel under warm, running water or use a damp cloth to remove all of the vinegar once you are done scrubbing. The stain should be minimized or removed.
 Wipe away all the moisture using a terrycloth or microfiber towel. Make sure all the moisture is gone so it doesn’t leave water stains.

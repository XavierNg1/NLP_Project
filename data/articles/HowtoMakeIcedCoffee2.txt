 Make it stronger than usual; you'll be diluting it with ice. The strength of the brew depends on how many ice cubes you plan to use.


If you want sugar in your coffee, add it now as the granules tend to dissolve more easily in hot liquid.
 Let the coffee cool to room temperature (approximately one hour), then move into the refrigerator for a further two hours to thoroughly chill.
 Fill a tall glass with the chilled coffee, add a few ice cubes plus milk or cream, if preferred. Stir well and serve.

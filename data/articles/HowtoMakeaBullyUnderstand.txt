 Some people are bullies because they believe they were the victims first, so they are standing up for themselves. Be confident, but don't yell, because that will only make the bully even more angry. Talk calmly and think about what your going to say before you say it.
, More students, and maybe even teachers if the situation is that out of hand, will intimidate the bully. Just remember that you want the bully to think of it as an intervention, not a gang-up. You should be the one talking, and have some friends there to protect you.
 Before confronting the bully, think about whether you have done anything for them to be mean to you. Even if you have and they are teasing you every day, it isn't okay, but figure out if you had ever done something to caused the bully to become defensive? Don't jump to conclusions and blame him/her immediately.
 You want to be confident, not vulnerable. If during the confrontation you realize you have done something that ticked them off, find a way to make amends for it., I'm truly sorry and I hope you'll accept my apology. However, I feel that things have got out of hand between us."

, If your tormentor is trying to look cool, point that out to him or her and explain that being nasty to others is not cool at all, and no-one finds it cool in any way.,, Try to find out why this person is the way he/she is. Is it a family issue? Friend issue? Traumatic experience? The list goes on. Be a friend and stop letting them pick on you by pretending it doesn't bother you to make them stop, and maybe even be a friend to them.
 If you were able to find even ground with this bully, forgive and forget. Maybe you will find that this once-bully is actually a great person to be around. Everyone has a good side. Sometimes it just takes a kindred spirit and some words of wisdom to bring it out.

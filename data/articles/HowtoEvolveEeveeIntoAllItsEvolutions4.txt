 Espeon evolves from an Eevee who levels up during the day with a high friendship rating. This means it can take several days to evolve into Espeon. To raise your Eevee's friendship, give it massages (At Veilstone City or Resort Area) and get the Happiness Checker App. If, when you touch its icon, two big hearts appear, you're ready!

, Get into battles with your Eevee in the day or morning until it levels up. If its friendship is high enough, it should evolve into Espeon.
 A man in Gateon Port's Machine Parts Shop gives the player a choice between several different items, including the Sun Shard. If you choose the Sun Shard and level up your Eevee, it will evolve into Espeon.


Espeon's highest stats are its Special stats, and its ability, Synchronize, passes on Burns, Poison, or Paralyzed status to the Pok√©mon that gave it a Burn, Poison or Paralysis.

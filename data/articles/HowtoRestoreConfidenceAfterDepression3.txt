 Going through depression doesn’t make you weak or a failure, but it can make you feel that way and do a number on your self-esteem. Just because you have gone through depression doesn’t make you less of a person. The fact that you have overcome it makes you a stronger person. Accept what you have gone through so you can build from there.You should remind yourself that you are strong and have accomplished something important, which is overcoming depression. That is a great starting point to build your confidence.
 Your confidence won’t build overnight. That is okay. Take it one step at a time and one day at a time. Each time you step out of your house, try something new, think a positive thought, or spend time with someone, you are slowly building your confidence.It may takes months to rebuild your confidence. Don’t get discourage if it takes you longer. Depression is serious, and even after you have overcome it, rebuilding your life can take time.
 Though you may be better and no longer depressed, you may want to continue going to therapy. Your therapist or psychologist is someone you trust who can help you learn how to build your confidence if you are unable to.


Your therapist can help you learn how to replace negative thoughts about yourself with positive ones. They also can give you tips on how to start socializing again, how to try new things, and how to accept what you have been through.
 Caring for yourself physically is also important. Make sure that you are seeing to all of your physical needs as best you can. Some things you can do to take care of yourself include:


Getting plenty of sleep every night.

Eating healthy foods and drinking lots of water.

Exercising for at least 30 minutes every day.
Making time to relax, such as by doing deep breathing, meditating, or progressive muscle relaxation.

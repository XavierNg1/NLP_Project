 If you spot an absolutely gorgeous girl, or just a girl who looks so cute or charming that you want to know her better, then it couldn't hurt to quickly ask for her number. To do this in two minutes, you have to make every second count. First, make sure she's receptive. She could be standing by herself or with girlfriends, not engaged in a deep conversation or looking like she's searching for someone.


Once you've found the perfect girl, wow her with a big grin and strong eye contact.
 Walk up to the girl like you're on a mission. After all, you are. Turn toward her and tell her your name. Ask her what her name is. No matter what the name is, tell her it's a beautiful name.


Make her laugh.
Tell her that you're usually not so forward, but that the second you saw her, you knew that you just had to know her.
 Tell her that you absolutely have to get going but that you knew you'd regret it if you didn't at least try to get her number so you could get to know her better in the future. Say, "I really wish I could get to know you now and to show you what a great guy I am, but I have to get going. Can I get your number so we can pick this up later?"


If she gives you her number, thank her and say you're excited to get to know her. Then walk away quickly, like you really are busy.
If she won't give it to you, just laugh and say, "You can't blame me for trying!" After all, you just took a risk. Be proud of yourself for making an effort.

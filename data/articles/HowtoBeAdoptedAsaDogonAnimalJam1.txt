 Wolves or Arctic Wolves are a good choice, since they look the most like dogs. When picking colors, choose a light brown for Color 1 and a dark brown for Color 2. You could also choose a black and a gray, or an orange.;
, You could wear any type of Blanket, Leaf Bracelets, and maybe a Spiked Collar if you have one. If you don't have a Spiked Collar, choose a regular necklace in your favorite color.
 You can do any pattern you want (even polka dots if you want to be a dalmatian). If you want, do the square-ish swirls in color 2 for an Arctic Wolf.

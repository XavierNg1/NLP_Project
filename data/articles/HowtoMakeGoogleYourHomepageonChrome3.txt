 With the Google homepage already open, click on the icon, producing a drop-down menu with a variety of options.


The menu icon is a small button with three horizontal lines. You can find it below the “x” in the upper right corner of your browser.
Make sure that the Google start page is already open. This method will only work if Google is currently open in your browser as you go through the process.
 The “Settings” page will open in a new tab as a result.


Do not close the Google tab.
 This option appears under the "On startup" section of your "Settings" page.


Your other startup options include "Open the New Tab page," which will open a blank page once Chrome starts up, and "Continue where I left off," which will open the tabs that remained open at the end of your last browsing section.
 This option appears to the right of the "Open a specific page or set of pages" option.


Clicking on this link will cause a separate "Startup pages" dialog box to open.
 When you do this, a list of all currently opened pages will appear inside the “Startup pages” dialog box.


The list will show both the name of the website and the website URL.
 If you have other pages or tabs currently open, those will appear on the list as well as Google and must be deselected.


Hover your cursor over the far right of the dialog box, directly next to the webpage you want to remove. An “x” should appear.
Click on the “x” to remove the page.
Continue removing pages until only Google remains.
 Doing so will save your startup settings and close the “Startup pages” dialog box.


You will be returned to the Chrome “Settings” page. No further action is needed at this point, however.

 While any dog breed of dog can be born with a cleft palate, purebred dogs suffer from a higher incidence of this developmental issue. Brachycephalic breeds, which tend to have short or effectively absent muzzles, are the most commonly affected. The specific breeds that are at greatest risk include Boston terriers, Pekingese, bulldogs, miniature schnauzers, beagles, cocker spaniels, and dachshunds., More to the point, do not breed dogs that were born with cleft palates or parents of offspring with cleft palates. It is likely that the gene for particular types of cleft palate is recessive, and can be carried by male as well as female dogs. As such, dogs that were born with cleft palates and their parents are all likely carries of genetic material that is likely to cause cleft palates in their offspring., Not all pregnancies are intended. Accordingly, the best way to remove the genetic defects that cause cleft palates from the gene pool is by neutering or spaying the dogs that carry the genes corresponding with these defects. It is cruel to breed dogs knowing that the puppies are especially likely to suffer from genetic maladies.

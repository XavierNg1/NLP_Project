 Go to the shop you researched and decided on, allowing plenty of time for the process of getting the tattoo.


Be prepared for the tattoo to hurt while getting it done, as any tattoo does. Finger tattoos can be particularly painful, as there is very little muscle to pad between bones and tendons, through which the vibrations of the tattoo machine will then resonate.Remember to hold still and be patient, as a finger tattoo is very small and requires the artist’s attention to detail to complete it carefully.
 Always listen to your tattoo artist and follow any guidelines for cleaning, moisturizing, and otherwise dealing with your tattoo after application.


Because the skin of the hands and fingers regenerates quickly, it’s typically advised that you moisturize frequently with an unscented lotion and refrain from exfoliants or harsh soaps, especially in the initial healing period.
Keep hands clean, and wrap the tattoo with your aftercare cream and plastic wrap if you must cover your hands with gloves of any sort during healing.
 Know that a finger tattoo is nearly guaranteed to need touching up by a tattoo artist later on in the life of the tattoo, due to “fall out,” bleeding, fading, or any of the other common issues associated with tattoos on sensitive skin such as this.


If you see blurring in the lines of your tattoo, or parts of the color didn’t take right away after getting your tattoo, notify your tattoo artist and make an appointment for two to four weeks later to go back in and get it cleaned up.It’s always a good idea to return to the same artist that did your initial tattoo to get touch-ups done, whenever possible, unless you had a negative experience with him or her.

 If you're unsure of what to talk about, you can ask them about themselves. Read what they have to say and ask them questions that relate to what they are texting you. The more that they open up and text you about their lives, the more often they will want to text., Once a level of trust has been built, they will likely open up to you and talk about more serious things. The worst thing that you can do is to be judgemental about the things they are sharing with you. Try to be understanding instead of judging them.If you're judgemental, they may be afraid to open up to you in the future and may not want to text you anymore.
 Don't second guess every text you want to send. If you find yourself typing out long texts and deleting them, stop and try to relax. The more that you act like yourself in the texts, the less pressure you'll have in future conversations. Be yourself and don't filter what you are going to say., A text conversation can sometimes get interesting and there's no way to direct the conversation. Instead of trying to force things, just go with the flow and text naturally. Listen to what they have to say and open up when they start opening up to you. If you want to ask for a date or to ask a deeper or more intimate question, wait until it feels appropriate to do so.


Don't get personal too fast or else they may be turned off by you.
 Being pushy or sending too many texts in a row can turn a person off and cause them to ignore you. Instead, play it cool and wait for them to respond. If they don't initially respond quickly, it could be because they are busy.As a rule of thumb, you should wait for a response after sending two texts.

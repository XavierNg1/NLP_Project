 If you wish to send someone a condolence letter be sure to do it in a timely manner. You should write the bereaver a letter within two weeks of their loss. This is the time that they are most focused on grieving. They will be dealing with funeral arrangements and preparing for their final goodbyes.If you miss this timeframe or find out about the death months after it has occurred, go ahead and write the letter. There is no need to explain why your card is arriving late.;
, Writing a general condolence letter will not be very comforting to the griever. Be aware that you are writing about the griever’s loved one. Be prepared to feel uncomfortable and vulnerable.Refer to the deceased by name. For example, you may say something like “I am very sorry to hear about Janie’s passing.”

, Each death is different and each person deals with grief in a different way. Avoid telling a griever how to grieve or what to do next. Unless you know and feel comfortable with their religion affiliations, avoid using religious opinions within the letter.Avoid saying things like “everything happens for a reason” or “they are in a better place.”
Avoid saying things like “I know how you feel.” Everyone’s pain is different and this will not be comforting to the griever.

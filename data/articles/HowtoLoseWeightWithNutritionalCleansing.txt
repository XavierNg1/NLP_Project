 Fruits and vegetables are two food groups that are a key part to a cleansing and healthy diet. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber. All of these qualities are important for a healthy and cleansing diet.


Include one to two servings of a fiber-rich fruit or a vegetable at each meal. This will help you meet the minimum guidelines of five to nine servings daily.The number of servings will vary based on your age and weight; however, including more fruits and vegetables can help increase the amount of nutrients you can consume from them.
One serving of fruit is generally one small piece of fruit or about 1/2 cup chopped.One serving of vegetables is 1 cup or 2 cups leafy greens.One of the attractive qualities of over-the-counter diet cleanses is that they are often high in fiber. They can clean you out from the inside out; however, adding a lot of fruits and vegetables can provide you with adequate natural fiber for the same cleansing benefits.
Focus on the most high-fiber fruits and vegetables. Include at least one serving of one of these fibrous foods at each meal: cauliflower, broccoli, artichokes, Brussels sprouts, berries (like raspberries, blueberries or blackberries), apples, or pears.;
, Dark, leafy green vegetables are filled with a huge amount of beneficial nutrients. Eating at least one to two servings of these types of foods each day can help support your nutritional cleanse by providing a lot of fiber, antioxidants and other nutrients. They even been touted to be one of the best "cancer-fighting" foods.Dark greens can be eaten raw or cooked. Try: kale, mustard greens, spinach, collard greens, bok choy, or Swiss chard.
Dark greens contain a huge variety of nutrients including: Vitamins A, K, C, and E. In addition they contain a significant amount of folate (which is important for DNA replication and repair) and carotenoids (an antioxidant thought to prevent cancer).Eat dark greens mixed with scrambled eggs, saute them with a little olive oil and garlic for a nutritious side dish or use them in salads.
 100% whole grains are another great nutrient-rich food group. They contain protein, vitamins and are also a good source of fiber.If you're interested in a cleanse and improving your diet, switch your grain choices to 100% whole grain.


Whole grains provide you with a host of benefits. Choose grains that have gone through the least amount of processing and contain little additives. For example, instead of a whole wheat couscous with a seasoning packet, choose to prepare plain whole wheat couscous and add your own seasonings at home.
Other examples of unprocessed whole grains include: 100% whole wheat pasta, 100% whole wheat bread, brown rice, quinoa and oats.
Skip refined, processed grains. Some grains, like refined or processed grains, add little nutritional benefit to your diet. They can be higher in calories, lower in nutrients and promote constipation (as they are lower in fiber). Switch out grains like white bread, white rice or plain pasta for whole grains., Many nutritional cleanses focus mainly on fruits and vegetables. Although this has many benefits, it's important to also include sources of lean protein at each meal.

In addition, it's important to help maintain your metabolism and muscle mass.One serving of lean protein is about 3-4 ounces. Include one serving at each meal or snack. Examples include: 4 ounces of poultry or lean beef, two eggs, 1 ounce of low-fat cheese, 1/2 cup of low-fat dairy or 1/2 cup of legumes (like beans or lentils).Include a variety of protein sources throughout your day and week. In addition, keep red meat to a maximum of one serving weekly.In general, women need 46 g of protein daily and men need 56 g daily. However, this amount may be different depending on your age, gender and activity level.Although protein is important, don't go overboard. You'll be able to meet your daily recommendations with just a few servings daily. If you're interested in a cleanse and a healthy diet, you should emphasize fruits and vegetables.
 Some foods aid your digestion by providing your GI system with healthful, protective bacteria. Fermented foods have become more popular and are a great way to add those "good" bacteria into your diet.Fermented foods to try include: kimchi, kombucha, kefir and sauerkraut.

Consider eating a moderate amount of saturated fats (found in meat and dairy) from high-quality sources.It is recommended a person eat three to nine servings of healthy fats per day.One serving size is equivalent to: 1 teaspoon oil (olive, peanut, sesame, walnut, etc.); 1/2 tablespoon nut butter (natural, with no added sugars); 2 tablespoons or 1 ounce of avocado; eight black olives; 10 green olives; seven almonds; six cashews; nine peanuts; four halves of walnuts.Try eating two 6-ounce servings of fatty fish per week.

The exact amount of fluid you need daily depends on your age, weight, gender and activity level.
Pure water is the obvious choice to keep you hydrated, but remember there is water found in other beverages and even your foods. Milk, tea, and coffee all contain water (though if you're doing a cleanse, you should stick to decaf tea and coffee).
Also consider starting your morning off with a glass of hot lemon water. A few studies show that this acts like a mild and natural diuretic. This may help reduce bloating.Avoid all alcohol, sugary beverages and caffeine. If you're doing a nutritional cleanse, focus only on clear fluids. Ditch the alcohol, sugary/sweetened beverages and caffeinated beverages.

 Place the cream cheese into a mixer. Add the eggs, vanilla extract, and sugar substitute. For extra flavor, add a dash of cinnamon and/or ½ teaspoon of maple extract. Blend everything together until combined.

You can also use sugar-free vanilla syrup instead of vanilla extract.
If you don't have a mixer, use a blender or food processor instead.
 Scrape down the sides of the bowl often to ensure that everything mixes in evenly. If the batter starts to thicken too much, add a splash of almond milk, half-and-half, or heavy cream., Heat the pan over medium heat first. Once it's hot enough to make a bead of water sizzle, spread some oil, butter, or cooking spray over the surface. If you used butter or oil, be sure to wipe most of it off with a paper towel., Use enough batter to make a 4 to 6-inch (10.16 to 15.24-centimeter) wide pancake. This will typically be about ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of pancake batter. Depending on the size of your skillet, you may be able to fit more than one pancake—don't let them touch, however!

Use a soup ladle or ice cream scoop to measure out the batter.
 Once the pancakes form crispy edges, and the bubbles pop, they are ready to be flipped. Slide a spatula under the pancake, then quickly flip it over onto the other side., It's ready when it's a golden-brown on both sides. Once it's ready, use the spatula to slide the pancake onto a plate., Every so often, you will need to re-grease the skillet. If you use oil or butter, be sure to wipe it off with a paper towel. This will prevent the pancakes from turning out too greasy or splotchy., You can serve them as they are, or drizzle some maple syrup on top. You can also try them with whipped cream or sliced fruit!

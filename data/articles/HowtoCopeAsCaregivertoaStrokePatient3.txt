 It is common for caregivers to want to set goals for their patients, but setting unrealistic goals for your patient may lead to disappointment. Instead, try to set goals to meet your patient’s basic care needs, such as keeping your patient clean, comfortable, and well-fed.Avoid setting unrealistic goals for your patient. For example, you might want to work on language skills for two hours every day with your patient, but with all of your other responsibilities, this might not be realistic.
 Your patient may feel better and be in better spirits if you encourage him or her to practice more healthy habits. This can also reduce the chances of your patient having another stroke. Try to encourage healthy habits, such as:Eating healthy foods.

Not smoking.
Getting regular exercise.
Getting adequate rest.
 Making some modifications to the environment can also help to ease your workload. Any modifications that you can make to provide a safer environment for your patient can make your life easier.Look into things like putting a hand rail in next to the toilet, getting child locks for cupboards with dangerous chemicals inside of them, or getting a hospital bed with electronic controls for your patient to sleep in.
 Your patient may qualify for certain services or resources that can improve his or her life. Requesting these services can also ease your burden as well and make caring for the person a little easier. These may include:Visits from a home health aide or nurse to provide baths and other personal care.
Meal delivery services, such as Meals on Wheels.
Rides from a local transportation service to make getting to doctor’s appointments easier.

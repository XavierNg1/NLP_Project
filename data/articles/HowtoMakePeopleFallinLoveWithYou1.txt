 Smiling is one of the most powerful ways to send a message to someone that you are friendly and loveable. The next time you meet someone new, just give them a big smile to show that you are friendly. You should receive a smile in return if the person is also friendly. Make sure that your smile is relaxed and natural, not forced or exaggerated, or your smile might not get the result you were hoping for., An eyebrow flash is also an effective way to signal to someone that you are friendly. An eye brow flash is just a quick up and down of both of your eyebrows at the same time. It can be seen at a distance, so you can use it as your approach someone or from the other side of a large room., Tilting your head slightly to one side also signals your friendliness, since it exposes your carotid artery. Your carotid artery is a highly vulnerable spot on your body, so we interpret a tilted head as sign that you are a friend that you see the other person as a friend too. Just don’t tilt our head too far to either side or it will look strange. A slight tilt is all you need., Eye contact can signal your trustworthiness to people, which makes it essential for getting people to love you. You don’t need to stare at people, but you do need to make good eye contact with people when you are talking and listening to them. It is okay to look away now and then, but make sure that you hold their gaze for as long as they hold yours.

 Both perms and relaxers change your hair by changing the chemical bonds. For this reason, permed and relaxed hair is really vulnerable to breakage and damage.
 Also, try not to dye your hair, if you're also chemically styling it. These processes can increase the risk of damaging permed or relaxed hair.
 If you have scalp irritation, or any abrasions on your scalp, then you should not get a perm or use a relaxer.You should also hold off if you have just removed braids or extensions from your hair. Wait a few days or until your scalp is no longer irritated to relax or perm your hair.
 Coloring permed or relaxed hair is possible, but it can damage your hair. Try clip-in weaves for highlights instead. If you need color, wait at least three days but no more than seven days for your appointment or talk to your stylist about what's healthiest for your hair.

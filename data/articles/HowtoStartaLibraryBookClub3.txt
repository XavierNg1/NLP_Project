 One of the best parts about hosting a library book club is that it becomes far easier to borrow the book from the library instead of buying it. If you take this option, however, you need to stick with books that are popular enough to have enough copies for all your members within the district, but not so popular that all those copies will already be checked out by non-members.
 Many libraries receive discounted rates on the books they buy. Your library may be willing to buy books for your library book club at those discounted rates as long as you offer to donate the books to the library once you finish. Getting first access to library books will be an incentive for people to join your club, which will draw more traffic into the library.
 Simple stories do not lend themselves to much discussion. On the other hand, books that are controversial, books that raise many issues, and books with unclear endings or intricate details usually offer a lot to talk about.
 Once you have a solid member base built, you can begin taking requests and suggestions from your members. You can either take turns choosing or put each suggestion up for a vote.
 Create at least 10 to 15 open-ended questions for each book. Do not allow members to simply state that they liked or did not like the book. Ask questions that encourage them to explain why they have the opinion they have.
 Since every member will be reading the book from a slightly different perspective, you may find yourself surprised by how varied the questions and ideas will be.

 A good friend or family member can help you change your focus when thoughts of failure come up. Choose someone who is light-hearted and can make you laugh or smile.


You might call or drop by and say, "I'm in a funk. Can you help cheer me up?"
You may even be able to take your mind off your own problems by helping this person with something. See if they could use your help with something., A great distraction technique is visualizing the order of something. This can help take your mind off thoughts of failure, and improve your mood.For example, close your eyes and imagine you are in the grocery store. Think of one specific aisle and visualize the different items on the shelves.
You can also try this trick with songs on an album or with the order that items are placed in your bedroom.
 Negative thoughts can make you feel cold and lonely inside. Comfort yourself with something warm. Sipping hot tea or taking a hot shower or bath may help to warm you up emotionally.Take your treat to the next level by choosing exotic teas or by adding scents to your bath.
 One way to overcome feelings of failure is by doing something. You'll naturally feel less negative when you exercise your brain and get in the flow of an interesting activity.Distract yourself with activities such as exercising, gardening, reading, watching a movie, making a to-do list, or practicing a sport.

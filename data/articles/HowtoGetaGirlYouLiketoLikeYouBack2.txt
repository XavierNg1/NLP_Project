 You can't know someone until you talk to them. Conversations won't fall into your lap; you need to make them happen. Try to sit next to her in a class. Comment on something she's wearing as you pass her in the hall. It doesn't have to be deep, just natural. Get her interested in talking to you. Here are some conversation starters:


"That last class was so boring!"
"What are your planning to write about for the paper next week?"
"Do anything exciting over the weekend?"

, Look at what colors she likes to wear. If she likes to read, ask her about the book she's reading. Ask her what TV shows she likes. Ask her friends, if they seem receptive to helping you. Finding common ground will increase your appeal.


"I see you're reading , how are you liking it?" "I'm reading the same book do you want to read it together on face-time?"
"Been to any good concerts lately?"
ask her questions about herself and her friends/family, the more she tells you the more you can talk.
 You want to keep the conversations carefree in the beginning.

Depending on the end-use, you may wish to match the fabric to ensure that the bag is strong, somewhat water-resistant, etc.;
, Have the side of the fabric you don't want to see facing outwards.
 Leave the top edge open.
 If wished, a zipper can be added to the top. If not, tuck the top edges inward a little way and stitch in place firmly. This will make the top edge stronger and finishes it off nicely.
 Sew the end of a strip of fabric to one corner of the opened edge of the bag, then do the same with the other end. Now the bag has a handle.

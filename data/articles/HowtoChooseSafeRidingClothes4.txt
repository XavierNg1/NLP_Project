 Ensure that your riding boots fit properly. They should be snug, with a small amount of toe space for comfort. They should support your ankle without interfering with your ability to flex at the ankle and drop your heels.
 The heel on the typical riding boot is designed to prevent the foot from slipping through the stirrup; if the heel becomes worn down, it is time to replace the boots. While not recommended, it is possible to wear any boots with a small heel as long as they are comfortable. Take care to ensure that they will not slip through or catch on a stirrup in the event of a fall.

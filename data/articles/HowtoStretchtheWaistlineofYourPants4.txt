 Turn on an iron and set it to the highest temperature and steam settings.
 Zip or button up the pants and pull them over the ironing board until the waist is stretched as far as it can go.


If you don’t have an ironing board, you can also stretch the waist across a wooden chair (cover it first with a towel to protect the wood) or across a sturdy wooden board like a cutting board.
You can pull on the waistline at this point as well for some extra stretching.
 Then pull as hard as you can on the waistband.
 Begin ironing (not steaming) the waistband with one hand while continuing to pull on it with the other. The goal is to iron the waistband until dry.


Do this around the entire length of the waistband. Don’t, however, go below the stitching of the waistband—if you do, you can end up with pants stretched out in odd places.
 If you need more stretch, repeat the process again until the right stretch is achieved.

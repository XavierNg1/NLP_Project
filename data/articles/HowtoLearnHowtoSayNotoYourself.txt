 Were you deprived of something, food or possessions, as a child? Did something happen in your early adulthood that affected you in that way? Understand what can cause issues like these.


Deprivation as a child or adult
Feeling that you are owed it
Spend your money before someone else does;
, Let that person know that you love yourself and that you are going to have to show that love by setting, and accepting, limits. Too much, is too much.
 Take baby steps when you begin denying yourself things that you historically have not denied yourself. Something like setting yourself a bedtime and keeping to it instead of going to bed whenever you feel like it.
 Rules help us construct a norm and then stick to it.
 Maybe when you say, "I want something' come back with, wait for 3 days to purchase it.
 Teach yourself to compromise your desires with what is healthy for you.

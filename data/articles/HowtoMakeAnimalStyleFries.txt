 Read the instructions on the bag of fries to prepare them. You can also make some homemade fries if you'd like, both options are suitable for this recipe.
 Wait for a few minutes for the fries to cool down, you don't want to burn your hands with the hot fries! However, you don't want the fries to be too cold either.
 Place some of the fries from earlier on a plate or in a bowl. Place some American cheese on top followed by the cooked onions and special sauce.
 Pop the fries in the microwave for a couple seconds to melt the cheese to your liking. You can also bake the fries in the oven for a few minutes.
 Once the fries are out of the oven or microwave and they have cooled down it's time to dig in!

 Break the unsweetened chocolate into squares and put them in the saucepan. Stir occasionally over low heat until the chocolate has completely melted. Keep a close eye on the saucepan so the chocolate doesn’t burn., Measure out the sugar-free peanut butter and sugar substitutes and add them to the saucepan. Then add a pinch of salt. Stir the mixture until everything has fully combined. Taste the mixture and adjust the sweetener if necessary., Remove the saucepan from heat. The fudge mixture will be very thick. Stir it one final time, then use a spatula to scoop the mixture out and pack it all into the loaf pan., You can leave the fudge out on the counter until it naturally cools to room temperature, or you can place it in the refrigerator to speed up the process. Once the fudge has cooled and is firm to the touch, cut it into about 18 pieces. It’s ready to be served.

Store the fudge pieces in an airtight container for up to one week.

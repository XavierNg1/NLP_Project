 The longer the string, the longer the lizard. Three feet is a good start.;
, This will lead to a loop at the other end of the string.
 Really, any sort of clasp will work. All you need to do is create a slipknot around the clasp. You should have your loop on one side of the clasp, and the long excess string on the other.
 Reach into the loop and pull the strings through, pulling until tight. This creates a simple slip knot that will hold the lizard in place as you work.
 Make sure the strings are not tangled up, and that you can clearly tell which string is the left string and which one is the right.

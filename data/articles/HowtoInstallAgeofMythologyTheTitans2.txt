 Steam is an online gaming service and digital store operated by Valve corporation. It's free to sign up for and install and it works on nearly all modern computers. The prices for games on Steam are usually comparable to (or cheaper than) retail prices. This makes it an especially convenient way to find older, more obscure games like Titans.


You can get Steam here. Click the "Install Steam" link in the top right to start.Be sure to select "Mac" or "Linux" on the next page if you are using either of these systems.
 As of April 2015, Steam offers Age of Mythology: Extended Edition, which is essentially an "updated" version of the game released in 2014. Extended Edition contains both the original game and the expansion pack, making this a nice option if you don't have either.Extended Edition also has new features not included in the original Titans release. These include improved graphics, streaming integration, and new game modes.
Note that this version of the game is only offered for Windows.
 On the Steam Store page for Extended Edition (available here), click "Add to Cart." On the next page, click "Purchase for myself." Supply your credit card details and billing information. When you're finished, select "Purchase." Your card will be charged and the game will be added to your Steam account.
 If you click the "Library" option at the top of the Steam window, you'll see your list of games, which should now include AoM. When the download process is complete, double click the game to start the installation. Follow the prompts.

When it's finished installing, select Extended Edition from the list and click "Play." The game should open and run.

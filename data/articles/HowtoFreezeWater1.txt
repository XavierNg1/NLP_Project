 It takes several hours for the temperature in your freezer to adjust if itâ€™s not at that temperature already., The water should still be liquid, but the temperature is actually below freezing. If the bottles are frozen, then something has gone wrong. Recheck the temperature and try again.
 The entire bottle should slowly turn into ice. You can also open the bottle which may start the freezing process.


If you freeze the bottle with the cap off, or carefully remove the cap, then you can try dropping a piece of ice into the water to instantly change it to ice. You can also pour the water over ice and make yourself ice sculptures.

 Fragile splinters, such as those from plants or fiberglass, often respond well to removal with tape. You can use many different types of tape for this procedure including masking tape, duct tape, or electrical tape. You will only need a small piece of tape.









Make sure that the area around the splinter is clean and dry before you apply the tape.
Wash and dry your hands before you get started as well.
 Apply the tape to the splinter site and press it firmly to make it stick to the splinter. Make sure that you do not press the splinter deeper into your skin as you do this. Apply pressure out and away from the entry point of the splinter.
 After you are sure that the tape is making contact with the splinter, pull off the tape. Peel away the tape slowly in the same direction that the splinter entered your skin.As you pull on the tape, the splinter should stick to the tape and come out.
 After you have removed the tape, check it to see if the splinter is stuck to it. You should also check your skin to see if any part of the splinter is still embedded in your skin. If you still have all or part of the splinter, then you can repeat this process or try a different method.

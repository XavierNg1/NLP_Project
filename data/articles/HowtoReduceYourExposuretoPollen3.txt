 Mow your lawn regularly to discourage the growth of flowers and weeds. Manually cut or pull up any tall grasses that you didn’t specifically plant, as grass pollen causes allergies as much as tree and flower pollen. Use the mower on a short setting to keep grass trimmed and tamed.


Have someone mow for you, if you can. Paying your neighbor’s kid to mow for you will save you from pollen exposure and provide them with a responsible and profitable activity!, Various grasses—like rye grass, Bermuda grass, and Johnson grass—are worse for causing allergies. Replace them with low growing plants that produce less pollen, like Irish moss, bunchgrass, or dichondra. If your garden contains any other high-allergy culprits, replace them or at least prune or remove their blooms.When you're done gardening, leave your gardening gloves and tools outside so you don’t transport dirt and pollen into the house. If you have an outdoors sink, wash your hands before going indoors, as well., When you’re working in the garden be sure not to touch your face or rub your eyes, which will just directly transport pollen to your most susceptible areas. You can also wear well-fitting sunglasses when outside to protect your eyes from pollen landing in them.If you know you’re going to be exposed to large amounts of pollen or are severely allergic, wear goggles and an allergy mask – a filtered mask that covers your mouth and nose.

 You can use fresh or dried fruit when making your own fall potpourri blend. If you choose to use fresh fruit, you'll need to use the potpourri immediately and simmer it. Place a small handful of your fruit into a medium sized mixing bowl. You can use any of these flavorful fruits:Apple slices (fresh or dried)
Orange slices or peels
Cranberries (fresh or dried)
Lemon slices or peels

, You can use almost any fall materials in your potpourri. If you want to use larger items (like pine cones or cinnamon sticks), just use 2 or 3. If you want to use smaller items, you can add a few handfuls to your mixing bowl. Consider using:Whole nuts (with their shells)
Cinnamon sticks
Whole cloves
Whole nutmeg
Juniper berries
Dried rose hips
Laurel (bay) leaves
Pine cones

, If you only have one or two types of essential oils, you can just sprinkle 4 or 5 drops over the potpourri and toss it together. You could use cedar wood oil, clove oil, cinnamon oil, orange oil, or pine oil. Or consider mixing essential oils to get these fragrances:Fall plants: peppermint, fir, eucalyptus, tea tree and rosemary
Cinnamon spice: orange, cinnamon, clove and vanilla
Autumn air: sweet orange, lemon and fir

, Stir the potpourri and set it out in a decorative dish. Your house will soon smell like your unique fall potpourri. You could also simmer your potpourri to diffuse the fragrance faster. Just scoop a few tablespoons of your potpourri into a saucepan with a cup or two of water. Heat the potpourri over low heat and turn it off when you smell the potpourri.You can store your own dried potpourri in a sealable jar until you're ready to use it.

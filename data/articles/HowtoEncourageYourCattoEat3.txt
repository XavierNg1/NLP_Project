 Start by adding just a little bit of the new food to the old food. As days go by, gradually increase the new food and decrease the old food until eventually you're just feeding the new food.Switching foods may also help a finicky cat eat more, if it doesn't like the old food.
 You can't just withhold the old food until the cat eats the new food, as that can be very dangerous for a cat. Instead, offer the new food for 30 minutes. If the cat doesn't eat it, give the cat a small amount of the old food instead. Remove the food when the cat walks away. If you practice this method a couple of times a day, your cat will usually take to the new food in a couple of days.When cats don't eat, they can develop a problem with their liver, which can lead to death., For the most part, cats like routine. If your cat is happy with a food, try to stick with it, as changing can be difficult. If you're bringing home a new cat, it's a good idea to ask what food they've been on at the shelter, so you know what it's accustomed to.

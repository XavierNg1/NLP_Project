 Dog's can suffer from whiplash and neck sprain quite easily. Anything from a sudden halting brake during a car ride to jerking his head around playing catch or running with other dogs could have caused your pet to experience some neck pain., Your vet will want to run tests and may require X-rays, CT scans, or an MRI to rule out any more serious conditions. It's important to rule out those conditions, as many debilitating illnesses and infections that cause neck pain require quick medical treatment. Even a severe spinal trauma may require corrective surgery., If your dog is suffering from a sprained neck, your vet may prescribe muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatory medication to treat the pain and facilitate movement. Allow your dog plenty of time to rest and recover.Do not be tempted to give human pain relief medication to your dog unless instructed to do so under veterinary supervision.

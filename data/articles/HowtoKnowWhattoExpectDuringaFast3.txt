 Ask them to explain the purpose and specifics of the prescribed fast. Spiritual fasts usually focus on acknowledgment of and gratitude to a higher power. The specifics of a religious fast differ by religion, and speaking to a spiritual leader can assist the learning process.
 Increase your knowledge of spiritual fasting by reading books and articles on the topic.



Cut back gradually on food and drinks. Spiritual fasts requiring daylong abstention from food and drinks will disrupt your habitual routines, such as drinking coffee in the morning and eating large portions at mealtimes. To ease into the fast, begin cutting back slowly on daily coffee and eat smaller meal portions in the days leading up to the fast.
Practice meditation and prayer. Extensive thirst and hunger can cause irritability. Use meditation and prayer to ease the frustrations caused by the inability to eat or drink as desired.
 Ask others who have undergone the spiritual fast what to expect and how they sustain their commitment to the process.
 Some spiritual fasts require refraining from work and school for the duration of the fast. Notify your employer or school if you will be absent.

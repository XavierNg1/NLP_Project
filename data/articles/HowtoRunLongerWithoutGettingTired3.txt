 Avoid overextending your leg in front or in back of you. When you raise your knee ahead of you, keep that foot’s heel directly below it as you bring it down, so that your shin is perpendicular with the ground at a 90º angle when your foot lands. When you want to burst forward with a faster speed, focus on increasing the number of strides you take while maintaining this form, rather than reaching farther forward with your leading foot.The only time you should change the length of your stride is on hills. Shorten your stride to climb hills faster with more steps, and then open your legs up into a wider stride as you descend., Keep your back straight to open your chest and fill your lungs with air. Imagine drawing each breath all the way down to your stomach in a straight line from your nose and mouth to your belly.Lean forward a tiny bit to push your body forward if needed (for example, when you run into the wind),but avoid slouching so far forward that your lungs become constricted.
 Keep your eyes up so that you are looking directly ahead. Pump your arms front to back to drive your legs. Avoid crossing them over your chest in a side-to-side motion as you run, or bunching them up tight over your armpits.With each stride, your knuckles or hands should brush your hips on their way forward or back.Running with your thumbs up is a simple way to remind your arms to move forward and backward instead of side-to-side. Don’t hold them too rigidly, however,since this will tense up your arms, needlessly burning energy.

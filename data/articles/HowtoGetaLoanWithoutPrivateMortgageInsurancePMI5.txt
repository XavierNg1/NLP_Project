 PMI is an insurance policy to protect the lender, if your LTV is 80% or more. If you initiate a loan with less than a 20% down payment, you will be in this situation. However, as you pay down your loan over time, your LTV will decrease and you may be able to terminate the PMI payments.Suppose a buyer buys a $200,000 property with a $20,000 (10%) down payment. His LTV at this point is 180,000/200,000 = 0.90 or 90%. But over time, as he makes his monthly mortgage payments, he will reach a point where the amount of the remaining loan is only $160,000. The LTV is now 160,000/200,000 = 0.8 or 80%. At this point, he can contact his bank to terminate the PMI.
Consider another buyer who buys a $300,000 property with a $25,000 (8.3%) down payment. His LTV at the start is therefore 275,000/300,000 = 0.917 or 91.7%. But suppose that, as he is paying down his mortgage, the property values in his area also increase, so that the value of his property climbs to $320,000. When he reduces the amount of his loan to $256,000, he will be at an LTV of 80%. 256,000/320,000 = 0.8 or 80%, and he can now ask the bank to terminate the PMI.
 If you believe that your LTV has dropped below 80%, you may send a written request to your lender to terminate your PMI. Your lender is required to honor your request if:you have a good payment history
your payments are current
you satisfy any requirements the lender makes regarding proof of the property's value.
 The lender is required by law to terminate your PMI when your LTV reaches 78% or lower. For this to occur, your loan payments must be current in order for the PMI to terminate.

 As you massage your baby, use gentle touches. Touching them too hard can cause pain. Also try not to tickle them because this could upset them. Remember that the massage is supposed to be a soothing, relaxing activity.Make sure to remove all jewelry so it doesn’t injure your baby’s skin. Also be careful of your nails.
As your baby gets older, you can use a firmer touch as you massage them.
 As you conduct the massage, talk to your baby. Use a soothing, relaxing tone. This is a time for you to bond with your baby, so communicating with them while you massage helps strengthen that bond.You may sing to your baby, say their name, or tell them a story. It doesn’t matter what you say, just that you are connecting with your baby.
 As you go through the massaging process, you should watch the way your baby reacts. Your baby should be happy, or they should smile and giggle. They may also move their arms around. If they seem happy, continue massaging.If your baby tries to turn away from you, gets fussy, or becomes restless, stop the massage. Try again when your baby is in a better mood.

 Scene girls often come off as rude teens. Most people would be pleasantly surprised if a scene kid came up to them and was super nice, because most people immediately think that Scene kids are going to be arrogant and full of themselves because of the stereotype.
 Be sure you are very peppy sweet and happy. Don't act like you hate everything. Hating everything is not very Scene-like.

 Keep your fingers relaxed and rest the ball on the pads of your fingers.If your fingers are too straight or stiff, you will not be able to hold the ball in the correct position. Also make sure that your fingers are spread out on the ball.









Be careful not to apply pressure to the ball with your opposite hand. This can change the trajectory of your shot.
It will take practice to correctly balance the netball. You want to cradle the ball and make sure that it is stable, but you do not want to hold too tightly and have trouble releasing it either.
 Make sure your feet are in a good position. If your feet are not hip width apart, you may be off balance when you shoot. Keep your feet parallel and do not let one foot be too far in front of the other. You do not want to be too close to a defender while you are shooting.








Your hips and shoulders should be in a straight line. Many people allow their shoulders to move forward which will cause the whole body to move forward. Leaning forward when you shoot will change the trajectory of your shot.
If you are having trouble keeping your hips and shoulder aligned, have someone hold your shoulders back as you shoot so that you can feel what the correct position is.
 Try to practice shooting for 15 or 20 minutes each day, even on the days that you have a team practice. Shooting will eventually become second nature to you. You will be less affected by fatigue or a defender in front of you if you are comfortable with your shot.








You only have three seconds to shoot when you are in the game. Try not to hold the ball too long even when you are practicing.
Whether you are practicing alone or with a partner as a defender, focus on the back of the ring as you shoot.
Try to practice with a coach or a more experienced shooter. Constructive feedback can help you grow as a player.

 There are 3 basic types of grips people use:


Palm grip: This is how most people hold their mouse. Your entire hand lies flat on the mouse.






Claw grip: This one is like the palm grip, but characterized by arched fingers in the shape of a claw.






Fingertip grip: The entire mouse is held with just your fingertips, the palm won't touch the mouse.

, Find your perfect sensitivity. DPI is basically how mouse sensitive is. All the better gaming mice (Razer, Corsair, Roccat, Logitech) have a mouse tuning software, so set your DPI to your sweet spot.
 Do you mainly play FPS games? RTS? MMO? Most mice cater to FPS games, but there are also mice that have more buttons and macros designed for RTS games and MMO's.
 Look at the two main buttons. If they don't look distinguished and the mouse looks rather large, it's probably a palm-grip mouse. If the two main buttons are clearly indented or visible in some way and the mouse is kind of small, it's meant for finger and claw-grip players.
 Weigh all the advantages against the disadvantages

, You may want to consider buying a mousepad too if you don't already have one.

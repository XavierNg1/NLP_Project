 Your destination will depend on what you want to do: some players might want to visit the Grand Exchange to trade items, others might be on a quest, or you could simply be adventuring. If you're having trouble deciding where to go, just go anywhere (within the starting area if you're a new player).;
, The world map is located in the top right of the screen (by default), near your minimap and stat orbs (health, prayer, summoning, run energy). You can see your location donated with a gold marker. You can click anywhere on the map to set a marker to that location.


When you're done using the map, press ESC (default key) to close it.
If you created a marker to a new location, a blue hint arrow appears in your minimap. Follow it by clicking in the minimap area or on your screen.
Pay attention to your surroundings. Sometimes the character gets stuck behind a physical boundary and you'll need to re-navigate around it, or perform a certain action in order to pass it, such as opening a gate.
 This requires that you navigate to the lodestones first and then activate them by clicking on them. From then on, you'll be able to navigate to that lodestone any time you wish using the Home Teleport spell (located in top right minimap area)

, This only applies if you have a high enough magic level and runes to be able to cast the spell. Note that you never need magic or runes to use Home Teleport, these are available to everyone provided the relevant lodestones are activated.

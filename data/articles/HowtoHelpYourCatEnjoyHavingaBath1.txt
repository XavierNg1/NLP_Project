It can be useful to give your kitten a bath so she gets use to it, even if she doesn’t need one.If training your cat as a kitten isn’t possible, you can try training her as an adult cat.

, If your cat or kitten hates getting her nails clipped, you might want to do this a day or two in advance, instead of the same day as the bath. Clipping your cat’s nails beforehand will help limit the number of fabric items (e.g. towels, shower curtains, bath mats, etc.) her nails can get caught on if she struggles. Clipping her nails will also help reduce the number of scratches you end up with., Your cat or kitten will most likely want to stand up while she’s in the bath and you don’t want her to slip. Put some sort of non-slip bath mat on the bottom of the tub or sink where you’re giving her a bath.You could also put a towel in the tub or sink. The towel will obviously be soaked, but it will provide a soft place for your cat to stand.

Your extension (for example, "+1" in the United States or "+44" in the UK)
Your phone number (or email address)
A password for your account
Your first and last name
Your current country/region
Your date of birth

, Depending on whether you chose email or your phone number to sign up, you'll receive a code via email or text message. You'll need to enter this code in the provided field.

If you signed up with an email address, you'll also need to enter your phone number and verify it in the same way.
 Skype may ask for permission to use your microphone and camera. You may also have the option of adding contacts here., Even if you aren't in the Skype app, an incoming call will take up your whole screen when it comes through., Doing so will accept your call in audio-only mode.

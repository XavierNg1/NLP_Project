 If the item has broken cleanly into only a few large pieces, this will be fairly easy to pick up. On the other hand, glass that has shattered or splintered in many different directions will be a lot harder and potentially more dangerous to pick up.


If the object hasn't suffered too much damage and is something you want to repair to keep, such as a glass figurine, make a decision now to avoid throwing it out before trying to mend it. Depending on how expensive it is though, you may need to get professional help to mend it; just be sure to find all of the pieces.;
, First of all, cordon off the area to prevent babies, toddlers, pets and anybody else from walking or crawling over it. Have someone else stand near it if need by, while you get the items needed to pick it up.


Lock away boisterous dogs, curious cats and any other animal that could pass by.
 You'll need to look hard to find all the shards if it is badly broken.
 Don't assume that you can't be cut wearing these––you can. You still have to be very careful; they are just a better barrier than your naked hands.
 You might stick your knee into broken pieces.


Avoid assuming any position that could cause you to lose balance, or you risk slipping and stabbing your hand with the glass.
 Glass should glint readily the more light there is.
 The newspaper should be several layers thick but not so thick that you cannot roll it up neatly.
 Place these on the newspaper. Whenever picking up glass, do so with great care. A small brush and pan can also be used; just be careful to ensure no shards are left on the brush after use.


If the glass shards are so delicate or sharp, enlist the aid of a more than just your precious hands. See How to pick up broken glass splinters for precise details.
 Tape it together so that it cannot unfurl and cause glass to fall out in the disposal bag. Dispose of in the trash.

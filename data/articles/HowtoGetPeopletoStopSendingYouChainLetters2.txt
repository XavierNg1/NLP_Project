 A couple email providers allow you to "mute" or "ignore" a conversation. This will archive or delete all replies to that email without notifying you:


Gmail: open the email thread. Click More above the thread, then select "Mute" from the drop-down menu.Outlook (feature only in Windows version 2010 or later): Use the Ignore button. This is located in the Home tab when a conversation is selected, or in the Message tab when a message is open., It's not as easy to stop chain letter notifications on Facebook, unless you're willing to block someone. But depending on the type of chain letters you receive, you might be able to make them more bearable:


Go to Settings → Notifications → On Facebook → Tags. Set this to "Friends of Friends" or "Friends" to reduce the number of people who can tag you.
Return to Notifications and alter your Email, Mobile, and Text settings to reduce the number of notifications that get passed on.
If you are tagged in a post, use the "Unfollow Post" to stop getting notifications.
To disable all app notifications, go to Settings → Apps → Game and App Notifications.
 Consider using the "report as spam" button when you receive a chain letter. This helps your email client identify which messages you want to receive, and which should go straight to your spam folder.


If you use this often, there is a risk that all messages from that contact will be marked as spam.
 Many email providers allow you to set your own "rules" or "filters" to automatically handle incoming mail. For example, you can put all mail from your email-spamming relative into a separate folder. This is possible on Yahoo mail, Outlook, and Gmail, among others.
 If nothing else works, create a free email account and ask your chain-letter-loving contacts to "update" your contact information to the new address. Now you can browse your important emails without the spam, and check on the new account occasionally.

 Consumers shopping during Cyber Monday are at a high risk of hacking and identity theft. Take extra precautions when buying products online by creating unique usernames and passwords for each account you create. Make sure your passwords are complex by using a variety of letters and numbers, or a long stream of random words.To keep track of your user names and passwords, either write them down, or use a password manager like 1Password or LastPass.
 Thousands of fake websites and malicious mobile apps are created each year to scam consumers. Therefore, when shopping online, make sure you are shopping on the store’s actual website. And, make sure to download stores’ official apps.Poor web design is a red flag that a site is not the official site. Also, make sure the site begins with “https” or has a lock symbol next to the address, and ends with “.com” as opposed to “.co”
Research mobile apps well before downloading them. Do not rely only on reviews when downloading apps. Try to download apps that are linked to the retailer’s official website.
 Have order confirmations and receipts sent to your email address. Create a separate folder, like “Cyber Monday Receipts,” in your email so you can keep track of your purchases and keep your receipts safe. This is really helpful if you need to make a return or exchange, or if you want to monitor your purchases.If you are making a lot of purchases, monitor your bank account frequently during and after Cyber Monday. This way you can stay on top of suspicious activity.
If you have a mobile bank app, it is recommended that you turn on notifications for purchases during Cyber Monday.

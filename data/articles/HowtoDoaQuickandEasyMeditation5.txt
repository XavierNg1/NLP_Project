 Before you begin tensing your muscles, it may be helpful to engage in deep breathing. Breathe all the way down into your abdomen slowly, focusing on the sensation of your breath. Keep taking deep breaths until you feel a sense of calm and are ready to begin., Go through the list of muscle groups in sequence. As you work through each muscle group, tense the muscles for about five seconds each, then let go and let the muscles relax for about 10 seconds.Start by making a fist with your right hand and tensing your forearm.

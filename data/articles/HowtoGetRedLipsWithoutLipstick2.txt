 Using red fruit to give your lips a natural stain results in a pretty deep pink or red color. The deeper the fruit color, the darker your stain will be. Try the following different types of fruit to create the perfect stain:Cherries
Cranberries
Raspberries
Pomegranate seeds
Strawberries
Beets (not technically fruit, but they work just as well)

, Just as you would if applying lipstick, rub the fruit over your lips. Try to stay within your lip lines instead of letting fruit juice get above or below your lips. Keep rubbing until your lips are completely coated in juice.


Squeeze the fruit as you rub to release the red juice.
If you're working with a large piece of fruit, it might help to cut it into smaller slices for a more precise application.
You could also squeeze out the juice into a bowl and apply it using a cotton swab.
 Once the first layer of juice dries, you might decide you want a darker, more vibrant red. The more layers of fruit juice you add, the more red your lips will look. Let each layer dry for a minute before adding the next.
 This will help keep the fruit juice from rubbing off too quickly. A clear lip gloss will also add shine to make your lips look brighter and more vibrant.
 A natural fruit stain will fade away within a few hours. If you want to keep your lips red all day, keep some fruit with you so you can reapply color as necessary.

, Place these three ingredients in the top part of a double boiler over medium heat. As the ingredients begin to heat, stir constantly. Keep stirring until the butter is melted and the sugar and cocoa have dissolved into the butter. Remove the mixture from heat when it's ready and let it cool for a few minutes before adding the next ingredients.









If you don't have a double boiler, make your own: place a small saucepan into a larger saucepan filled with an inch or two of water. Put the ingredients in the smaller saucepan. Place the contraption over medium heat and stir.
To test whether the mixture is ready for the next step, dip your finger into the chocolate. If it doesn't feel very hot, keep cooking it. If you feel the need to remove your finger, it's ready.
 Use a wooden spoon to quickly beat the eggs and vanilla into the mixture. It will become smooth, glossy and pudding-like. Keep beating until the eggs are fully incorporated into the chocolate mixture.
 Use the wooden spoon to gently stir the flour into the brownie mixture until you no longer see any white spots. Beat the mixture for a minute or two until it's completely smooth.
 An 8 x 8 inch pan is the perfect size for these rich chocolate brownies. Either grease the pan or line it with parchment paper to keep the brownies from sticking, then pour the batter into the pan and use the back of the spoon to smooth the surface.









If you want to add a topping, sprinkle it over the top. You can use coconut, chopped nuts, or another topping of your choice.
To make thicker brownies, use a smaller pan.
 Place the baking pan in the oven and bake the brownies for about 40 minutes, or until a toothpick or fork comes out clean when poked into the center of the pan. Remove the brownies from the oven and let them cool slightly before cutting.

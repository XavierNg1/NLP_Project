 The bright red juice will create a dark auburn hue when used with dark brown hair. You don't need the flesh of the beets, just the juice. If you don't have a juicers, run the beets through the blender and use a strainer to strain the juice from the pulp.
 Place the beet juice in a bowl and add 1/4 cup of honey. Stir it well until the mixture is completely combined. This simple concoction is ready to apply to your hair.
 Shampoo it as usual, but don't apply conditioner. The beet juice will work better on hair without the residue left by most moisturizing conditioners. Towel dry your hair and use a wide-toothed comb to work through any tangles.
 Put on latex or plastic gloves and use your fingers to smooth it over your hair, making sure every strand gets evenly covered. If you want auburn highlights, apply the mixture to individual strands separated from the rest of your hair with aluminum foil strips.
 Put on a shower cap or a few sheets of plastic wrap and wait for the beet juice to turn your hair auburn. Let the mixture sit in your hair for 4 hours or overnight.
 Run your hair under warm water to rinse out the juice and honey, then shampoo and condition as usual. When your hair is dry, you'll see the dark auburn tones shining through.

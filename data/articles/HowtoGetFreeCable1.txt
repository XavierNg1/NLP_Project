 Some apartment communities offer movie channels in addition to basic cable channels.;
, They probably offer the free cable due to a deal with the local cable company or because they want to avoid satellite dishes outside of every unit.
 If you want to have additional channels, you might be able to pay for them through additional rent or a separate cable bill.
 Even if free cable is not offered to all residents in a building, you can ask for cable to be included if you are willing to pay for water or provide a higher security deposit.

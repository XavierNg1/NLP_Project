 You will get hot if it's not.
 You need to have confidence on the field. Keep a positive attitude. Above, softball is mentioned as being a mental game. You cannot give the other team your mind.


Make sure you vision yourself doing whatever you do in a game.
Take a deep breath and do not get stressed over one mistake, because one can turn into six, and so on.
Concentrate, no matter who is watching or what someone is saying.
Recognize what your error is when your not pitching or playing well. The faster you recognize and fix your errors without stressing out over them, the better you will become. (as long as you practice frequently)

, No matter what, don't lose your confidence. You will have bad days, games, pitches, and moods. None of those are a reason to forget all the good days, good games, good pitches and great moods! Try to stay even keel and see losses as learning experiences to help you improve.

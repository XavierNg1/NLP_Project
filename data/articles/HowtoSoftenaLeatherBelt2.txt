 Lay the leather belt outside on a sunny day. Leave it out for about ten minutes to open the pores and prepare the material., Coconut oil (the organic kind that you'd use for cooking) is a great easy-to-find softening agent. Try avocado oil, jojoba oil, olive oil, or almond oil. Use any natural oil that you would put onto yourself as a skin-softener. Leather is the dried and treated skin of a cow – so it essentially made from the same stuff as your own skin.


Natural oils have the added benefit of smelling pleasant. Rubbing alcohol and Vaseline will do a great job of softening up your belt, but you might be off-put by the decidedly chemical scent. Pick an oil that you like to smell.
Avoid using chemically hydrogenated oils – namely, most commercial corn oils and vegetable oils.
 Simply dip your fingers into the oil, then rub it thoroughly over the surface of the belt. Add multiple layers of oil for an improved softening effect. The more oil you use, the softer the leather will get.Don't worry about using too much. Most natural oil should not damage leather.
 Note that the oil—especially coconut oil—may slightly darken the belt. However, it also turns your stiff leather into a smooth, wearable material. If your belt is not soft enough, try repeating the oil treatment.


You can use this darkening effect to change up the look of your leather belt. Just make sure that you apply it evenly so there aren't any mismatching lighter splotches!

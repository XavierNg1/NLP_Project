Collect a harralander herb. Invest in clean harralander for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy harralanders are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.
Purchase a vial. Acquire water-filled vial packs to save you time. Any unused vials can be stored in your bank for later usage.
Collect 1 goat horn dust. You can kill a billy goat or goat in the Kharidian Desert and then use a pestle and mortar on a goat horn to get horn dust.
 This will create a "Harralander (unf)".
 This will create a three dose combat potion.

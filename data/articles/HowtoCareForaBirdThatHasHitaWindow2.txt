 If your feeder is close enough to the window, birds wonâ€™t be able to pick up enough velocity to hurt themselves when flying into it. If it is far enough away, then the bird will be more likely to recognize that the window is not part of the natural environment.


Ideally you should place your window either less than 3 feet from the window or more than 30 feet from it., Birds are drawn to the reflection of the natural environment that they see in your windows. Installing drapes or blinds will obstruct that reflection. This should reduce the likelihood of them flying into your window.You can also place decals on your window. However, to significantly reduce the likelihood of birds flying into the window you will need to have stickers placed no more than 2 inches apart horizontally and 4 inches apart vertically. This would obstruct much of your view. , These can be doubly effective. They will reduce the reflectivity of the glass, decreasing the likelihood that birds will fly into the window. Furthermore, they will provide cushion and reduce the chance of injury if a bird does fly into your window.

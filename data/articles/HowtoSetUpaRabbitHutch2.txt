 The first step in setting up your rabbit hutch is to evaluate your yard and outdoor space. By walking around and taking a good look at your yard, you’ll get an idea of which spaces are potentially suitable for your rabbit hutch. Consider a number of factors, including:


Shade.
Rain.
Proximity to the house.
Potential perils such as water runoff, sickly trees that may collapse, or unstable ground., After you’ve evaluated your yard, you should pick the most ideal location possible. You’ll want to pick a location based on all of the factors you’ve already evaluated. The location should be safe and secure from the elements and from predators. Consider:


Picking a spot that is on high ground away from any areas that could potentially flood.
Picking a spot that is shaded, but is also safe from falling trees or tree limbs.
Picking a spot that is close enough to your home so that you can monitor possible predators., One important thing to remember is to avoid putting your rabbit hutch in a location where other animals or livestock get to roam free. While your rabbits will be relatively secure in their hutch, other animals can be unpredictable and may hurt your rabbits.


Livestock could potentially knock over the hutch.
Free ranging dogs could see your rabbits as a snack and try to get into the hutch.
While some animals, like chickens, can safely co-exist around a rabbit hutch, be careful and monitor any interactions.

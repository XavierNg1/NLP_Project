 If you are interested in long scenic trips and highway driving, you will want to look for a touring or a cruiser with a large engine. You will need the power for speed and highway driving. If you are a thrill seeker, a sportier bike is for you. These are light and nimble, and probably a little easier to handle. If off-road racing and hill jumping is your game, then you will want to focus on dirt-bikes.;
, The type of the bike you are interested in should make a big difference here. A used dirt bike can sometimes be picked up on the cheap end; a used cruiser however, is still likely going to cost you a little. A new cruiser though, will cost you a significant amount of cash. You need to have an immovable price point though, that you will not cross over, not even by a buck.
 Straight line or V-Twin makes a difference in handling and speed and will determine which brand you can purchase.
 You need to have 1-3 specific bikes to choose from that you definitely want. If 1 or more is within your price range, this will help you weed out any above that, as well as give you an estimate on what you can expect to pay. At least you have a benchmark at this point.
 With new, you will obviously need to go to a dealer; with a used bike, you will have options. In almost all situations, you will probably get the best price on a used bike from a private individual; however, you will get peace of mind from a dealer - to a certain extent. A dealer can offer you a warranty that could help you in the event you have mechanical issues or purchased a lemon. A private individual would likely be cheaper, but you won't exactly be able to return it or have the buyer pay for the repairs.

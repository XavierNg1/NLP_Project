, For sight you usually want to have some type of goggles. Preferably binoculars make sure they aren't too big and have a moderate zoom capability. You may also possibly want them to have night vision as well. If you are doing something serious such as getting something or spy on another person you may want to use a camera that has a feed to a computer or another device where you can view it. Remember sight is one of the things people use the most in order to get the advantage. If you want to go overkill than you can by binoculars with IR capabilities.
 If you are opening a door you may want to have a small lubricant pen. If you are trying to cut something quietly or sever it you may want a Swiss army knife. If you want to unlock doors bring a bobby pen. If you want to distract a person bring a environment-related object with you that can be throwable.
 Clothing preferences are a highly recommended to be tight and dark. If you're a night person wear a dark blue color and make sure its tight. The tighter clothing will prevent tripping, brushing against objects and rustling noises. Also wear soft to flatfooted shoes.

 If you want to make your lips bigger without shelling out the big bucks, you can buy a much cheaper little device that will temporarily enlarge your lips. While each tool comes with it’s own specific set of instructions, they all rely on suction to perk up your pout. You place a small plastic device, no larger than a shot glass, over your lips and suck. When you remove it, your lips will look a bit swollen – which is the idea!The results of these devices are temporary, but can be great to use right before applying lip liner or lipstick.
Fullips is the original patented tool, and it can be purchased online.There are various other tools that will do the same thing, sold at beauty supply stores and online.
 There were glosses and serums promising rounder, larger lips on the market long before Kylie Jenner flaunted her own. Browse online or at your local beauty supply store for the different available products. Look for ones containing peptides, which help to make lips appear larger and more taut.Some of these products will tingle as they work, so don’t be alarmed!

, This isn’t a miracle lip enhancer, but it’s an often overlooked and critical part of your lip routine. Gently scrub your lips with a toothbrush daily, particularly before applying any lip product. This will remove any flakes of dead skin and brighten up your lips, which will actually make your lips look bigger.

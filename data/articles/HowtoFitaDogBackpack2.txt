 Once you have taken your measurements, you will have some idea of what sizes to try on your dog. A properly fitting backpack will fit snugly, but you should still be able to place a few fingers between the straps and your dog.


If the pack is too loose, it can affect the dog’s balance and cause them to walk improperly.A backpack that is too loose will move around too much while the dog walks, causing chafing or sores.
A manufacturer’s sizing guide can be helpful in narrowing down the sizes you should try for your dog.
 Just as a loose pack can cause problems for your pup, a tight one can cause injury as well. A pack that is too tight can cause muscle strain to the shoulder and back muscles, as well as impede lung function., A good pack will have enough padding to protect your dog from the extra weight. There should also be plenty of ground clearance for the backpack once it is on your dog, and your dog should be able to lay down when wearing it.Your dog’s legs should move freely and unimpeded when wearing the pack.
Shorter dogs will need shallow saddle bags that do not go further than 1 inch down the elbow of the dog., You want the pack to be secure on your dog’s back instead of sliding down or off. Strong, adjustable chest straps will also ensure that the weight load is on the correct part of your dog’s back (near the shoulders rather than the loin).Y-shaped chest straps help stabilize the packs and reduce neck strain.
 A pack that is water-resistant and has removable saddlebags is useful if you’re planning to hike through creeks or near water with your dog. A bright color and reflective panels will make your dog easier to find if it gets away from you while hiking.


The weight of the pack is an additional consideration. Look for one that is lightweight, weighing one pound or less.

 Miele dishwashers use 1/3 the amount of water used by most units so you don't need much detergent. For best results only use the manufacturer's dishwasher tabs. All other tabs should be avoided as they contain up to 3 times the amount needed. Due to the high concentration of detergent in GEL, DO NOT use more than 1 teaspoon per load. DO NOT USE GEL TABS. When using POWDER detergent DO NOT use more than 1.5 tablespoons (22.2 ml) per load.;
, Food particles, oils and detergent can coagulate to create a glue-like bond that will clog them. To clean, remove filters from the unit and rinse with warm water. If needed use a soft bristle toothbrush to gently rub off any remaining debris. This should be done at least once a month.
 Buildup of particles will diminish the spray arm's performance. To clean, remove the spray arm by unscrewing the locknut. Place it under warm running water. If needed, use a toothpick, paperclip (extended), or tweezers to remove lodged in particles.
 Soiled seals will deteriorate from left over detergent residue and develop odors from food particles. To clean the door seals wipe them off with a baking soda & water, or vinegar & water solution.
 Run a sanitize cycle at least once a month using distilled vinegar in an empty unit.(See Tips) The purpose of this “vinegar bath” is to breakdown detergent buildup.

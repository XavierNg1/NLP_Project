 Add a couple rounded triangles overlapping it for the first row of mountains. The slopes should be fairly gentle; no need to make them pointy or overly triangular.
 This will give your drawing more depth and detail., Sketch a triangle, almost as big as one of the mountains (due to the perspective of your drawing). Unlike the mountains, however, the tent is supposed to be pointy, so keep that in mind., Add two curves attaching the top of the triangle to the bottom. It should look as though the tent has a clear opening, in between the two curves., The more you put in, the better your drawing will look, since campsites are rarely sparse in terms of the landscape., Use greens for the land and trees, blue for the sky, and shades of green/brown for the mountains. Color the tent with a bright color (like orange) to make it stand out.

You can make it a night scene by painting the sky purple or black. Be sure to add the bonfire!

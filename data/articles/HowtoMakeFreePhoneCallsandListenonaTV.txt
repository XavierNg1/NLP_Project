If you want to make video calls, you will need a webcam installed on your computer. Most webcams come with microphones built-in.
Make sure to place the microphone/webcam in a place that they can be useful; webcams should offer a good view of you, and microphones need to be close enough to register your voice.
 Once your computer is connected to your TV and your recording devices are connected and configured, you can start making and receiving calls on your VOIP program. With Skype, you can make and receive free calls with other Skype users. If you have a Skype phone number, anyone can reach you as if you had a real phone, and you can call any number.


Some TVs have Skype and a webcam built-in. These are usually more expensive than regular TVs. You will be able to find Skype in the Apps section, and it will require the TV being connected to the internet.

 If mixing your spray with witch hazel, you’ll only need three ingredients--witch hazel, water and essential oils. Preferred oils include citronella, clove, lemongrass, rosemary, tea tree, eucalyptus, cedar, catnip, lavender and mint.


Fill spray bottle halfway with water. If you are really going for the natural, non-toxic mixture, use distilled or pre-boiled water. This is especially helpful when trying to protect small children or infants.
Add witch hazel by filling almost to the top. You will essentially be using half water and almost half witch hazel.
Add 30 to 50 drops of favorite essential oil. The more oil you use, the more potent the spray. Don’t forget to include citronella!
Add spray nozzle and shake to blend and mix.
 With this spray, you’ll want to combine your ingredients in a glass jar or bottle, as you will be fermenting the herbs in a cool dark area before you transfer to a spray bottle. The jar should have a lid or other way to be sealed.


Combine 16 ounces of apple cider vinegar with 1 tbsp. (one tablespoon) each of dried rosemary, lavender, sage, thyme and mint. Be sure to include a tablespoon of each herb in your mixture.
Mix ingredients in an airtight jar and place in a cool, dark area of the home. The jar will need to ferment and sit for up to three weeks.
Shake jar daily to infuse and mix ingredients. A simple tip once over will do the trick: There is no need for vigorous shaking.
Strain herbs from jar after three weeks and transfer liquid mixture to a spray bottle.

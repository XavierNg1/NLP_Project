 Your Weimaraner is like a shadow—it follows you around wherever you go.Rather than shooing your Weimaraner away from you, let it stay right there with you. Your Weimaraner will feel happiest when it’s close to you.


Being shadows can make Weimaraners very prone to separation anxiety.If your Weimaraner has separation anxiety issues, take it to your vet or a veterinary behaviorist. They can develop a plan for your Weimaraner to become comfortable with being alone.
 A Weimaraner’s shadow tendencies don’t stop when it’s bedtime. Your Weimaraner will feel happy and safe when it’s close to you at night. Even if you won’t allow your Weimaraner to sleep in the bed with you, move its bed close to your own., Your Weimaraner will feel happy when it feels like it’s a close part of your family. In addition to letting it follow you around and sleep close to you, consider taking it with you when you take a vacation. Also, let your Weimaraner ride with you in the car when you run errands.

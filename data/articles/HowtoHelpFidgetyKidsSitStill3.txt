 Fidgeting helps kids with ADHD concentrate and focus on tasks. If you discourage fidgeting, a child will spend all of their mental energy trying to stay still, which distracts them from their other tasks. As long as the fidgeting is not a distraction to others, you should allow fidgety behavior.For example, you might allow a child with ADHD to swivel in their chair, twirl their hair, or tap their pencil.This can be applied in the classroom and at home. Regardless of the setting, allowing a child with ADHD to fidget will help them focus.
 These toys are typically soft balls, like a stress ball, or objects that students can squeeze as they concentrate on a task. This ensures that the kids are not distracted by their own restlessness.Coloring books are another way for kids to be physically active while concentrating on a task.
 Various desks and chairs may help students work out their fidgetiness while boosting their concentration. Standing desks allow students to move their legs while they work. Stability balls provide a similar amount of physical stimulation for kids with ADHD. A Hooki Stool is another seating device that allows students to fidget while not distracting those around them.If it is not too much of a distraction, you might consider allowing students with ADHD more time to walk around while they work on a task.

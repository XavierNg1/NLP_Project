Otherwise, the boy may not like you for who you truly are.Dress nicely. Find clothes that suit your body and skin tone. Select the colors that best complement you. Although you should dress nicely, be sure that you appear modest and not over the top.;
, You want your lips to look irresistible, not dry or cracked. Start by regularly applying lip balm to keep your lips smooth and hydrated. Try avoiding bright lipsticks or sticky glosses as it can get messy and ruin your kiss.Another way to get soft lips is to gently exfoliate them with a wet washcloth and sugar.
Always keep a good lip balm on you just in case you need it.
 Before seeing the boy you want to kiss, be sure to brush your teeth and rinse with mouthwash, especially after you eat. Always keep breath mints or gum on you in case you need to freshen your breath if things look promising.Try offering a mint to him, as he may take it as a hint that you want him to kiss you.

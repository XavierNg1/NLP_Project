 Simple syrup - a mixture of sugar and water - is the favored sweetener at many specialty coffee shops. Because it is liquid, it mixes effortlessly into your coffee, which is especially helpful for iced preparations. Simple syrup is also preferable for sweetening high-quality coffees, as it lends no additional flavor to mask the coffee's own nuanced flavor profile.;
, Heat and stir until the sugar has all dissolved. The resulting mixture is simple syrup, and should be slightly more viscous than water.
 To keep the simple syrup for continued use, pour it into a squeeze bottle or other similar container. It can kept at room temperature almost indefinitely.
 You can flavor simple syrups using vanilla bean, cinnamon, citrus rinds, and other herbs and spices. Add the flavoring agent to the heated syrup, and allow it to steep for several minutes while the mixture cools down.

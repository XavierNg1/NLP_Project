 Upon logging, you would be brought to the main folder, which is the root folder. All your main folders are located here.
 Navigate through your folders until you reach the one that contains the files you want to share. Hover over the first file and a checkbox will appear. Tick on it to select this file and do the same for all the other files you want to share.
 Click on the Share button on the header toolbar, then select by URL. Weiyun Cloud will first compress the files you’ve selected into a single zip file, then it will generate a unique URL for sharing the zip file.
 A small window would appear with the zip file’s share link or URL. The URL can be a short alias for the actual URL. Click on the Copy URL link beside the URL to copy the link to your clipboard. Click on the OK button to exit the small window.
 Paste the URL you’ve copied on your email or IM client and send it. You can also post it on Facebook or Twitter to reach a broader audience. Anyone who has access to this link can now download your files.

 Begin by tapping the Conference button (the blue circle with an "i" inside, located near the top of your screen). Then tap the red circle (with a phone icon inside of it) next to the call you wish to disconnect. Finally, select "End Call," and that caller will be disconnected without affecting others participating in the call.
 First, tap the Conference button (the blue circle with an "i" inside, located near the top of your screen). You'll see a "Private" button appear next to each of your connected callers, so tap that button next to the caller with whom you wish to speak privately. If you wish for that caller to later return to the conference call, then tap "Merge Calls.", If you don't wish to be heard during part of your conference call, simply tap the "Mute" button found among the six boxes on your call screen. This will mute your speaker while allowing you to hear other conference participants.
 This will allow you to listen to your conference call without holding the phone to your ear, an especially convenient option when taking notes or conducting other business during the call. Simply tap the "Speaker" button found among the six boxes appearing on your call screen.

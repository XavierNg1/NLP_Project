 Watch for the mistakes that some people make when they get caught up in the drama of the show.;
, First, choose your own case. It doesn't matter which one.
 Remember, which cases you choose doesn't matter; you're just as likely to do well whether you choose in order (e.g. 1, 2, 3...) or at random (e.g. 24, 7, 16...).
 This is the hard part, and is covered more extensively in the Tips section below.


The number of cases you have to open varies by round. From the time you pick your case to the time the deal/no deal button needs to be pressed, you'll have to pick 6 cases. Each successive round there after, will require you to pick the past round's amount minus one (in round 2, you'll have to pick 5 cases instead of 6, and 4 cases in round 3, 3 cases in round 4, 2 cases in round 5, and 1 case until all other cases but one are shown onstage. After a no deal decision has been reached, you'll be able to switch cases if you'd like.

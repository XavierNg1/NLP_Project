 Anime girls often have fashionable outfits that are unique enough to give people an idea of their personality. When purchasing clothes for your Stardoll, decide on a theme or style that reveals her personality. For example, if she is sweet and kind, you may want her to wear cute, innocent outfits that include ribbons and cute hats.


An example of a cute look would be a beige jacket, a dress in a matching shade, a heart sling bag, pink platforms, and ballet detailing.
 Purchasing expensive pieces will eat away at your Stardoll dollars and lower your chances of quickly expanding your wardrobe. Rather than buying the most expensive clothing, find cute ones at a more reasonable price. Although you can splurge once in a while, be sure to keep an eye on your spending so that you have enough dollars for other purchases, such as makeup and hair.
 You should not only find unique clothing but also make space in your wardrobe for classic pieces. They will allow you to create a variety of different sets, preventing you from having to waste Stardoll dollars on different pairs of bottoms just to match a few shirts.

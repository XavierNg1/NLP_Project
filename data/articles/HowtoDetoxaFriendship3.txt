 Did you find yourself agreeing to many of the signals? Did the list enlighten your sense of loss about your friendship? If so, and if you feel that it isn't worth trying anymore, it's time to cut the ties.
 It's time to accept that you've outgrown this friendship, in the same way that you outgrow other aspects of your life. If you hear that voice some people enjoy trotting out that "you've just got to keep trying", then ignore it. By now, it's clear you've already tried more than enough and your friend crosses the line of forbearance when he or she continues to manipulate, demean, or gossip about you. It is just as important to know when to let someone go as it is to know when to keep trying, and at this point, detaching yourself is healthy and a stage of maturation in your life.
 Remove your friend from Facebook, your cell phone, your address book, etc. Dr Ray Pahl, a friendship expert, explains that too many friends in your life can be stressful and unfulfilling anyway,so it's important to leave your guilt aside too.

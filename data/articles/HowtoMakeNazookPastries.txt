 Set aside for 10 minutes.;
, Start with the butter, mix well. Then the egg, oil, and vinegar, mix again. Then gradually add the flour, one cup at a time, mixing after each addition.
 You want a smooth, firm dough that does not stick to your hands.
 Wrap it tightly with plastic wrap.
 It is better to refrigerate overnight, but 4 hours will do the trick.
 Mix 1 cup of the melted butter and the flour, then add the sugar and vanilla. Stir constantly for 1 minute, or until you have a smooth, even mixture that doesn't stick to your hand.
, Divide it into 8 equal balls. Place each ball on a lightly floured board.
 This doesn't have to be exact, but you want the dough as thin as possible. Then paint each rectangle with melted butter.
 It can help to use the back of the spoon to press it into place.
 Lift each side, and pinch the dough together on top.
 Use your hands, just put the 'seam' side down, and press gently.
 This is easiest with a serrated knife.
 It's best to have 2 inches (5.1Â cm) between them so they can bake evenly. Be careful not to let the filling spill out.
, The time will depend on haw many baking sheets are in the oven, but they are done when they turn golden brown.
 Remove from the tray and enjoy!

 Here you will find all of the settings for your mac.


Select “Language and Region”.
Click on “Keyboard Preferences”.
Click on the tab entitled “Input Sources”.
Make sure the “Show Input menu in menu bar” box is checked.
Exit system preferences.
Now that you have done this, the flag of your country should appear in your menu bar at the top right of your screen.
 This will allow you to access all of the special symbols on your Mac.


Click “Show Emoji and Symbols”.
In the search box, type out the fraction you are looking for (e.g. 1/2=half, 1/8=eighth, 1/4=quarter). In the search results you will see the fraction you wish to insert into your document.
Double click the fraction in the results box, and it should be inserted into whatever document you are working in.
 This will allow you to use the fractions you use often quickly and without searching for them.
 In most of Mac’s standard apps (e.g. Mail, Safari, Text Edit, etc.) this feature is already turned on, but if you are using Pages, you must turn the feature on yourself.While in Pages, go to “Preferences”.
Select “Auto-Corrections”
A box with several options will pop up. Here you should check the box next to “Symbol and Text Substitutions”.
Next, check the symbols and substitutions you are interested in using. In this case, make sure you check the “Fractions” box.
 Now you're ready. Begin by typing the numerator (number on top), a forward slash (/), and then the denominator (the number on the bottom). Pages should now automatically change this to look like a fraction.

 You are likely not the only person who wants to study for the English exam.Asking before or after class if anyone wants to meet for a study group can be a great way to increase the effectiveness of your studying.


You are more likely to be able to put together a study group if you do not wait until the day before the exam to suggest it: plan ahead.
 Everyone takes class notes differently, so circulating or comparing notes can be a good way to remember details about specific class discussions. This can also be a good way to review any material from days that you were absent from class.


Remember that your group members were not planning to share their notes, so be kind about their handwriting, messy notes, and/or doodling on their notes.
Don’t be embarrassed about the state of your class notes. You weren’t expecting to share, and even messy notes can be helpful to someone who doesn’t have any.
 A lively debate about the texts is a good way to get you interested in them and to review the content. Be sure you back up your discussion by looking at the text and finding opportunities to use “evidence” from the text to back-up your points.
 If your classmates are comfortable sharing the results of previous tests in the class, you can compare to see what types of responses seem to be the most successful for your particular teacher. Knowing, for example, if your teacher tends to give higher marks to longer, more detailed responses or to responses that are direct and to-the-point can help you determine how to approach answering questions on the test.

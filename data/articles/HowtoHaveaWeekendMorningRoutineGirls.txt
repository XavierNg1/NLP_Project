 Either is acceptable on a weekend. However, you will still need to take into account duties such as sport, activities or any chores or part-time work.


If you love to sleep in, plan it ahead. If you find you wake up early, go back to sleep and keep sleeping.
If you're a morning person who gets everything done first thing in the day, you may prefer to get up early as usual but take things more slowly.;
, Take into account that you can spend time in bed reading, watching a video on your iPad or just chilling out.
 It's the next best relaxing thing to do after sleeping.
 Use frozen fruits, spinach, yogurt, and milk.
 In a cereal bowl, put in vanilla or plain yogurt, granola, and fruit.
 Breakfast sausage, scrambled eggs, and cheese make a delicious sandwich. Peanut butter and fruit are good lighter options.
 When you finally feel ready to get dressed, start with a good clean first. Place your hair up with a clip or inside a shower cap, unless you're going to wash it. Let the feel of the water and its warmth cascade over your skin. Close your eyes and just relax. Enjoy the shower that you don't have to rush out from!


If it's stinking hot, have a cool to cold shower. Keep it at the temperature your body can handle nicely.



For your intimate parts use just water. Never use normal soap because it can damage the pH there.
 Dry yourself well.
 Wear clothes that are comfortable for the weekend and for the weather.
, Style it in a ponytail, with a headband or just leave it out, loose and free.
 This is the weekend, a time to relax. If you do need to dress up for the evening, keep the heavy makeup for then.
 You can either make one (it is the weekend after all) or use a commercial product you like.
,, Use a brow-pen or a brush.
, It's a time to be carefree and relaxed, and makeup-free is just fine.

 Don't brush your curls because that will create frizz. If your hair is tangled, you can go through it gently with a wide toothed comb. It might also be a good idea to have both of your hair ties on your wrist, ready to go.
 If you want a smoother look, lean forward first, so that your hair hangs straight down, then gather it into the ponytail. This will ensure that your curly locks lay smooth.
 The easiest way to do is this to grab your hair with the hand that has the hair ties around it, then use your free hand to slide the ties off your wrist and onto your hair. Wrap the hair tie enough times so that it holds your hair securely.
 If you have a lot of layers, you might want to twist your hair into a loose rope first. Your bun will still look messy, but it will be easier to work with.
 Start by sliding the hair tie onto your bun, then wrapping it enough times so that it fits snugly. Try to get all of the loose ends of your hair under the hair tie.
 Curly hair is great for creating the messy bun look, but it can get heavy. After a while, it will work with gravy and begin to sag. To keep this from happening, use bobby pins to clip the top, bottom, and sides of your bun to your head.
 With a wide tooth comb pull little strands of hair out of the bun. You can also just play with it until some hair falls out.
 This will keep it together for the day.

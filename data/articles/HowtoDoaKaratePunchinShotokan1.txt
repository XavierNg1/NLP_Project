 You can be in Natural Stance, shizentai, but you can also be in the lower, horse riding stance, kiba-dachi.


Confirm your legs are the correct distance. For Natural Stance your legs should be shoulder width apart.
Keep your legs loose, ensure knees are soft/not locked.;
, Your fist should be nesting against your side.


Your body should be slightly relaxed but ready and focusing on the target.
You should choose one of two targets. If you want to punch to the body, chuudan, aim for just below the ribs, called the solar plexus. If you want to punch to the face, jodan, aim for the face. For safety, or if you feel you lack control, your instructor may ask you to aim just below the face rather than at the face.
Note punching at other parts of the body is not as effective.
If you are not practicing with a partner, imagine an opponent of your size in front of you.
 Imagine a straight line from your fist to your centerline.


Keep you elbows in to keep the punch straight. The elbow should brush against your side.
Keep somewhat loose during the punch, until the very end.
 If you are practicing with a person, "connect" means, you stop just before actually hitting them. If you are using a target, such as a makiwara, you of course want to actually hit it.


Turn your fist over so the palm is now facing down.
Tighten your muscles as you land the punch. Ensure you are tightening not just your fist and arm, but your buttock, legs and hips.
Exhale. If you want, Kiai.

If you are advanced, add the hip vibration technique to maximize your power.
 Keep focus, do not go floppy.

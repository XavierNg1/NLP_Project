 If it is baby, let them explore on their own. If they are a child, show them around or give them a small tour of your den. If a teen, give them a short tour of the den, but avoid giving strict rules during it. If any of these jammers make this game tedious or irritating already, unbuddy them and give them back to the adoption center. This game is meant to be fun, and you should not have to put up with a rude player.
 If you upset the jammer, they can run away. Don't make up random rules as you go along, this makes you look capricious and immature. Prepare and care for the child. Let them enjoy themselves, but also let them grow. It may seem hard to let your child grow up and get their own children. But if you try to force them to stay young, they may leave you.
 If you have a pool, prepare a bath there. If you don't, take them to Crystal Sands or Lost Temple of Zios and bathe them in the water.
 They may run away if you do it when they are a child or teen and can do it themselves. But, if they are a baby, help them out with this task.

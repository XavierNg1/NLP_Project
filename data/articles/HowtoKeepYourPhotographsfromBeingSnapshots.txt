 Say something with your photograph. Even if you are just sharing the beauty of what you see;
, If your viewer has to figure out what you are portraying, then it doesn't have a subject.
 This works with the main subject.
 The default of a camera is landscape. That would be horizontal...basically 4 X 6. Portrait is a vertical type shot with 'dimensions' of 6 X 4.
 If you take the photo now and it is a simple snapshot. Change your perspective and it becomes a memorable photograph.
, Will it detract, or enhance, your image. Is there a way that you can 'fix' it.
 Obviously, you can't move the forest (or the tree), but when you can, move things around.
 Do your best to direct their eye.

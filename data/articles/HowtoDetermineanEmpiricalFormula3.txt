 If you have the molecular formula of an unknown compound but are told to identify the compound by its empirical formula, you need to determine if the formula can be reduced. Look at the subscripts for each element present. If all three subscripts share at least one common factor (other than the number 1), you will need to take a few more steps to determine the compound's empirical formula.



Example: C8H16O8

On the other hand, if the subscripts do not all share a common factor, the molecular formula is also the empirical formula.


Example: Fe3O2H7




, Write the factors of each subscript within your formula. Identify which factor is greatest in value.



Example: For C8H16O8, the subscripts are "4" and "8."

The factors of 8 are: 1, 2, 4, 8
The factors of 16 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
The greatest common factor (GCF) between the two numbers is 8.
 To get each subscript in its simplest form, you will need to divide all subscripts present in the formula by the GCF you just found.



Example: For C8H16O8:

Divide the subscript of 8 by the GCF of 8: 8 / 8 = 1
Divide the subscript of 16 by the GCF of 8: 16 / 8 = 2



, Replace your original subscripts with their simplified values. In doing so, you have determined the compound's empirical formula from its molecular formula.


Note that values of 1 are not usually indicated with subscripts.

Example: C8H16O8 = CH2O

 These are listed below under "Things You'll Need".;
, Glue the pinecone to the base of the metal bottle cap using craft glue. Be aware that this action may use up a lot of glue in order to prevent the tree from toppling over. Make sure the glue has dried before you continue.
 Find an open area (preferably outdoors) to spread the newspaper. Spray paint the pinecone on top of the newspaper to prevent any mess.


Be sure to wear a mask if you're not painting outdoors, to prevent inhalation of paint fumes.
 Before the paint has dried on the pinecone, sprinkle it with the white glitter. The newspaper will catch any excess glitter. You can add a lot of glitter to simulate snow on the pinecone, or a little, depending on what looks best.
 Use the colored beads to simulate Christmas lights on the pinecone tree. You can either wedge the beads in between the petals of the pinecone, or you can glue them (safer).


If you're gluing, you may have to hold the bead in place for a minute or so, until the glue dries enough to stop the bead from slipping off.
 Glue the small bow or star to the top of the pinecone to simulate a tree topper. Again, you may need to hold the bow in place until the glue dries a little.

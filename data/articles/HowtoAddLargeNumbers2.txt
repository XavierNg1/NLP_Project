 This method is sometimes called "new math" because it only gained popularity as an instructional method in the 1990s. It is also known as "partial sums algorithm."This method only works for numbers greater than 10.


This method relies on recognizing the "place value" of each digit. The organizing principle of our common method of writing numbers is based on positional numeration: that is, writing numbers in categories, or units, of tens.For example, in the figure 4357 refers to 4 thousands, 3 hundreds, 5 tens and 7 ones.
To add multiple numbers, write them in a vertical column, and draw a line beneath them. However, instead of a simple sum below the line, you will be writing your secondary, simpler math steps.



Beneath your line, write the sums of each place digit, starting on your left. For example, using the example above, the first number below the line will be 7,000, followed by the next sum (500), followed by 60, followed by the number 9.
Next, add these together. Because there will be only one number in each column, you can easily see that the resulting sum will be 7,569.
 Sometimes a sum from one place value will need to be added to another place value. This results in a multiple step problem, but it is not more complex. It is simply the same steps, repeated.


For example, when adding the two numbers 587 + 474, you will need to add 5 hundred to 4 hundred, writing the sum (900) below the line. Then add 8 tens to 7 tens, resulting in 15 tens, which can also be understood as 1 hundred and 5 tens. Write this below the above number (900). Finally, add 7 ones to 4 ones, resulting in 11, or 1 ten + 1 one. Write this number at the bottom of your problem.
Now, take the new figures and add them. This time you do NOT have to write all the 0's to keep your number in its proper place, because your other numbers will do that. 9 hundred to 1 hundred = 1000. 5 tens + 1 ten = 60. The 1 is left as is. Your final sum is therefore 1061.
Use a zero as a placeholder for unused mathematical units. In the example above, for instance, a zero is used to indicate the fact that between the thousand and the sixty, there are no hundreds in this number.
 For example, to add 982 + 247 + 475, you'll need to add 900 to 200 to 400 (1500). Then add 80 to 40 to 70 (190). Finally add 2 + 7 + 5 (14).


Next, break apart these numbers to their value places: 1500 = 1000 + 500. 190 + 100 + 90. 14 = 10 + 4.
Then repeat the addition, continuing to work left to right: thousands, then hundreds, then tens, then ones. In this case, your figure will be 1000 (total), then 500 + 100 (600), then 90 + 10 (100), then 4.
Repeat the addition, if necessary, until all units are resolved into their proper place value. In the example given above, the 1000 is resolved. You have two numbers in the hundreds which need to be added (600 + 100 = 700), no tens (0) and 4 ones.
The process is complete when all numbers are in their proper units. In the case above, you can see that the sum will be 1 thousand, 7 hundreds, 0 tens, and 4 ones, or 1704. This is your total.

 Keep it simple and leave lots of room in the middle for the "wool". Don't forget to include a tail, as most lambs have tails for a while.;
, Also include the tail. Allow the glue to dry.


One cute addition is a small ribbon bow to the "chest" area of the lamb. Simply glue into place.
, Perhaps "Happy Easter" or "I love ewe", etc.
 Post or give it to the recipient.

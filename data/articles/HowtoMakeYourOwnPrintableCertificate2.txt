 Word Templates Online has an extensive collection, as does the official Microsoft Office site at http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/CT010104321.aspx.
 Once you have found the desired gift certificate, roll your mouse over it and click "Download."


If you're using the Microsoft Office site and you're using a browser other than internet explorer, click download again on the next page.
 If you downloaded from Word Templates Online, it will show up as a ZIP file entitled something along the lines of "Free Gift Certificate Templates". Double click it, and a word document with the same name should show up. If you downloaded from the Microsoft Office site, it will be a word document labeled with a bunch of numbers and letters.
 Fill in the desired portions and print the certificates.

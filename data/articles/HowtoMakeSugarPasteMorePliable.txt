 Before trying to add anything, give the sugar paste a good knead. It may be all that is needed.;
, Use white vegetable fat, as this will match the color of the sugar paste. As with any cooking, add only a very small amount first; you can always increase but not reduce additions.
 Add the paste to the bowl and let the dough hook process it briefly.
 It can even stick to a dusted surface, so use this trick often.
 Aim to have more sugar paste than the cake size when covering the cake. This means that you will have room for error, as extra length can be trimmed off.

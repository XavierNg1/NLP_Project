 This could be a man-made well, pond, ocean or river. To make an infinite water source, put four buckets of water into a 2x2 block hole. Then, you can use this water as many times as you want and it will not run out.
 If your lawn is big, you may need to have more than one bucket.
 Try pouring it on the center of the lawn so the water will spread out.
 Items such as flowers and tall grass will disappear. You'll be able to pick up the flowers afterwards.
 The grass should be all gone. Admire your mowed lawn.

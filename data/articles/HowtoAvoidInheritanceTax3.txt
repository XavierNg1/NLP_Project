 If a surviving spouse is the heir, there is no applicable federal estate tax as long as the spouse is a U.S. citizen.


If a surviving spouse is not a U.S. citizen, do some estate planning to leave a special trust to the spouse. However, the estate will be taxed once the surviving spouse dies.
 The first $5.4 million of an estate is exempt from taxation. That means that if the value of your estate was $10.4 million, only the second $5 million is subject to taxation.
 Estate planning is the best way to limit taxes.


Update the estate plan on a regular basis to reflect tax law changes, changes in assets, and family changes.
An estate plan has the added benefit of preventing disagreements between beneficiaries after a death.
 Any amount that you bequeath to your spouse is exempt from taxation when you die. Furthermore, when your surviving spouse dies, the $5.4 million exemption would still apply. Use these exemptions to your advantage and set up a trust for your spouse of at least the amount of the standard exemption. This is an example of combining the rules to produce a favorable result for yourself.


For example, if your total estate was $10 million, then you could divide the estate into two equal trusts of $5 million each. The spousal exemption takes care of the estate taxes on one portion, and the exemption on wealth less than $5.4 million takes care of the remainder of the estate. This means that a $10 million estate could be completely exempted from estate taxation. Without taking advantage of the exemption, the estate would owe roughly $2 million in taxes.

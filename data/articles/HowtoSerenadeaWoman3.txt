 If singing isn’t for you, consider hiring a musician or group to perform for her. Instead of stressing out, you can snuggle up with the woman and enjoy the concert. If you feel moved, you could even ask her dance.
 Are you a talented instrumentalist? Instead of singing, woo her with your skill on the violin, saxophone, or piano. In addition to impressing her, you’ll also highlight one of your many unique skills.
 If you are not at all musically inclined (or maybe just a little shy), it is still possible to express your feelings through music. Create a playlist with romantic and meaningful tunes. During your next date, turn on the playlist. At the end of the night, send her home with a copy of the special mix.

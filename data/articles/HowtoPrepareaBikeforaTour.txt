 If you are using a mountain bike you will need to get rid of those wide knobbly tyres. This can increase your efficiency on the bike by up to 30% and is the easiest way to really make a big difference to your ride. Replacing slick road bike tyres with wider touring/hybrid tyres will increase grip in poor weather and make the ride more comfortable.;
, Touring with anything on your back can make you tired more easily and give you chafing and blisters. Installing a rack on your bike and using pannier bags gives you more freedom when you ride. Most mountain bikes will have the necessary bolt holes in the frame but many road bikes will not. You can purchase pannier racks that mount onto the seat post to overcome this problem, or you can try to bodge a few holes, be careful though!

, If you are using a mountain bike and have suspension with a lock out option, use it. Suspension absorbs some of your pedal energy which could be transferred to the wheels, better still change your suspension for for rigid ones to save on weight.
 Riding in the rain is unpleasant at the best of times, this can become unbearable if you don't have any mudguards. Water can also flick up from the back wheel onto your panniers causing them to become saturated. It's also much nicer for anyone riding behind you!

, This will give you a better range of riding positions for your tour. Cycling all day in the same position can take its toll on your body, changing position throughout the day will reduce the chances of aches and pains.
 These will add some extra power to your peddling motion and help keep your feet in the right place.

 Sometimes, you may not have time to take your shoes off and perform a full foot reflexology treatment. You can use hand reflexology instead. You can also use hand reflexology if your feet are injured or infected in any way., You can do this by applying pressure with your thumb along the outside edge of your palm. Work on your right hand first and then switch to your left hand., You can do this by applying pressure to the area just beneath your pinky and ring fingers on the top of your hand.On the palm of your hand, the area for your shoulders and upper back is located just beneath your pointer and middle fingers. There is also a reflex point for the upper back on your palm just below the base of your thumb, on the outside of your hand.
Always work the reflex points on both hands; your left shoulder reflexes are at the base of your left pinky and your right shoulder reflexes are at the base of your right pinky.

 This will open the Find Friends section of the Facebook app with the "Friends" tab active.


The process for finding friends is essentially the same for both Android and iOS.
 This screen will allow you to search for people to add, which is useful if you know some of the person's info.


Tap the "Search" tab at the top of the "Find Friends" screen. You may have to scroll the tabs to the right to see it.
 You can search for people using their name, email address, or phone number. You can't perform many advanced searches using the app. See the first section of this article for details on using the Facebook website to find more people.
 The "Suggestions" tab of the Find Friends screen will display your suggested friends based off of mutual friends or other aligning interests. The list can be quite large, and you can continue to scroll down to load more results.


The "Suggestions" tab can be found on the far left of the row of tabs.

 The first option is for location sharing, represented by an arrow. Leave this how it is and do not tap to enable it. People watching your video won’t know where you are if its disabled. You can still share your video without people knowing how to find you. Just be discreet when it comes to identifiable landmarks on your video.
 The second option is for “Private Broadcast.” Private Broadcasts do not appear in the Global List and only the people you invite can join.


Tap the padlock icon, and enter the names of the people you want to invite to your Private Broadcast on the next screen. This way, only people you invite can watch your video.
 The third option is for chat restriction. Tap the chat icon if you only allow users you follow to chat on the video. This will restrict others from leaving their messages on your video.
 The fourth option is for Twitter sharing. Leave this how it is and do not tap to enable it so your video won’t get tweeted. This way, people on Twitter won’t know you’re broadcasting.
 Once you’ve finished configuring the broadcast settings for your safety, tap the red “Start Broadcast” button right below the four options. You are now live.

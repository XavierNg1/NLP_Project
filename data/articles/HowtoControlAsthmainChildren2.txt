Keep track of the times when your child experiences extreme shortness of breath or coughing and wheezing.

Keep an eye on exactly when these symptoms occur and the extent to which they interfere with your child’s day-to-day activities such as playing with friends, attending school or sleeping.

Keep track of how many times per day your child needs to use an inhaler to ease the symptoms of asthma.
 Sometimes coming up with a scale of one to ten or a color system can help your child to communicate easier about the severity of the asthma symptoms.


During an attack, ask your child to rate her symptoms on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst, regarding how bad the symptoms are at the moment.






You can also make a color chart similar to a traffic light to help your child tell you how bad her symptoms are, with red being the worst.
 Many times, your child will be prescribed long-term medications to help manage asthma and reduce the incidence of attacks. There are also medications that are meant to provide your child with relief from asthma symptoms quickly in the event of an attack. Become familiar with the uses of the different types of medications and know when to use them.
 If you use your action plan correctly, you should be able to easily identify the asthma attacks that can’t be managed by parents at home.


If your child has trouble speaking to you or if your child’s nostrils are very wide when breathing in, it may be time to seek emergency medical care.

If you are ever in doubt, always err on the side of caution. A child with an obstructed airway needs to receive medical attention as soon as possible.

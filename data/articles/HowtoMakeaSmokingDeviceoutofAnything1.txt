 An apple or zucchini are good options. Make sure you choose a fresh fruit that doesnâ€™t have soft or rotten spots., Use a small paring knife to cut a depression out of the top of the fruit.
 A kitchen skewer works well for this purpose as it is long and thin with a sharp point., Poke a small hole through the bowl to connect to the channel in the side.
 Make sure that air can flow between the depression carved for the bowl and the hole. Remove any chunks of fruit that appear when you blow through the hole.
 Poke small holes in the foil using a safety pin. Lining the bowl will help keep your smoking material dry from the moisture in the fruit while the holes will allow smoke to pass through.
 Fill the foil lined depression with the substance you are smoking.Light the material with a lighter while you inhale through the hole poked in the side.

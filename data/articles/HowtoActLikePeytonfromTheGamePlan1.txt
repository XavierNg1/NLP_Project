 Peyton is a ballet dancer and therefore dresses with class to represent that. She wears blazers, mini jean skirts over thick tights. Some shoes to go with Peyton's outfit would be UGG boots, penny loafers, and other cute shoes. Jeans and cords would also go great with her outfit. Peyton loves pink, so try to find any cute pink shirts to go along with her outfit. Take this into mind when dressing, because you won't go wrong. Since her dad was Joe Kingman, a pro football player, she occasionally wears football jerseys.;
, She wears ballet leotards in pink, white, blue, and purple colors. Tights are usually worn underneath. Her hair is always pulled back into a ballet bun. Occasionally, a skirt will be worn over the leotards.

 Use a pencil and tape measure to align the sides. Measure from the bottom 2 in., 14-3/4 in. and 27-1/2 in. to mark the bottom of the shelves.


Add an optional touch by cutting a 1 x 1 dog ear at the bottom of the sides for decorative flair.
 Carefully sand cut pieces to remove debris and smooth wood.
 This is where using clamps may come in handy. Clamp the system down after you have applied the glue. Add supportive nails (about three nails) to the glued area to ensure the system stays in place.
 Proceed the same way as you did when gluing and nailing the sides--clamp the system down after you apply glue and then add nails. Consider leaving a 2-in. overhang on each side for decoration.
 Consider sanding and then removing the debris with a soft cloth before adding paint or stain.

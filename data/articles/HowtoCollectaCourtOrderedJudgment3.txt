 Before you can record a lien, which will give you an interest in property owned by the debtor, you must wait for a certain period after you receive a judgment against the debtor (usually 30 days)., After the waiting period is up, you will need to obtain, fill out, and file an Abstract of Judgment.This form puts a lien on any land or building owned by the debtor.To find this form, go to your local court's website or visit your local courthouse in person.
There is usually a fee associated with filing an Abstract of Judgment.Check your jurisdiction's fee schedule to get an idea of what the fee might be.
 Once the Abstract of Judgment has been issued by the court you filed it with, you will need to take the Abstract of Judgment to the Recorder's Office in order to have it recorded.As a rule of thumb, record the Abstract of Judgment with the County Recorder's Office in the county where the debtor lives or has their place of business.You can record the Abstract of Judgment in as many counties as you want.


Each time you record the Abstract you will have to pay a fee. Contact the County Recorder's Office you are going to record in and ask about the fees they charge.
 After your debt has been satisfied, you will need to obtain and fill out an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment form. This form can be accessed online at your local court's website, or by going to your local courthouse and talking with the clerk of courts.


In addition, you will need to name every county you recorded an Abstract of Judgment in and will need to have that information notarized.You will then need to take this acknowledgment and have it recorded in all of those counties (there will be a fee for recording each acknowledgment).Mail a copy of these forms to the debtor, file a copy with the court, and keep a copy for yourself.
If you fail to file an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment, or fail to notify the debtor by sending them a copy, you could be liable for any damages suffered by the debtor.

 Perhaps there isn't someone right now to whom you need to admit a mistake but you'd still like to know if you've taken on board the suggestions contained in this article. You can try this out by testing your response to a deliberately made mistake. The next steps detail some mistakes you can "try" and then test your response:


Read the newspaper upside down. When someone notices, what will you say to them?
Hug someone you don't know. When they act surprised, what will you say?
Drop something in the kitchen, like a condiments jar. What will you say to the person who notices your mistake?
Drive home from work without a map, following a brand new route. When you feel lost, how will you react? Will you ask for help or keep driving even more lost? Will you call home to admit what you're doing?

, In each case, you're pushing yourself outside of your usual habit or comfort zone. And you're opening yourself up to someone else noticing and possibly judging you. Try reacting in these ways:


Own up to the mistake. "Why yes! So I am reading this newspaper upside down. To be honest, I'm actually snoozing behind it but you've caught me out!"
Make amends if needed. "I'm sorry I dropped your favorite jar of pickles. I was testing out a theory. I'll buy a new one in the morning."
Most of all, focus on your self-awareness of how it feels to make a mistake consciously. You're not perfect but you are clued in to your limitations and the importance of always making a positive connection with others.

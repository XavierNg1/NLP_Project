 The plant should be divided when it is dormant. In warmer climates, this may be mid-December or February. In colder climes, it may be dormant from late fall to early spring. Since the plant will no longer be producing stalks, it may be hard to spot, so be sure to mark the plant with a stake or stick, so that you can find it again.


If you live in an area with snow, it is best to do this before or after the ground freezes.;
, The soil may be cold at this time of year. Wear appropriate clothing that can be soiled.
 Since rhubarb can only be divided every 5 years, the roots should be firmly attached to the crown. You will need to break some roots under the crown with the fork.
 Each section must have at least 1 white or pink bud on it. You may need to look carefully before using the spade, in order to see the hidden buds.


A large rhubarb plant could be divided into up to 8 plants, as long as care is taken to include a bud and at least a small amount of root with each section.
, The hole should be bigger than the rhubarb crown section.
 Make sure the top of the crown is at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the top of the hole.
 Press it down with your foot to ensure that the crown is firmly planted in the soil.



Root pieces need to be properly protected if you are not planning to plant them immediately. They must not dry or freeze. Keep them moist and moderately warm.
 The rhubarb should start to sprout in early spring, when the soil warms.

 Q-Tips can be used in the outer ear to remove superficial earwax, but don't dig into the ear canal with a Q-Tip. The tissue in your ear canal is extremely delicate; it's easy to introduce infections by smashing into any of the tissue near the tympanic membrane, or eardrum.


Another reason that doctors advise against using Q-Tips to remove substantial buildup in the ear is that you're likely to push more earwax into the canal than you are likely to bring it out. If that's the case, what's the point in using a Q-Tip?

, Ear candling is when you place a cone-shaped device into the ear, light a candle on the far end of the spout, and let the pressure of the candle vacuum out the earwax. That's the theory, at least. Ear candling doesn't work, and is dangerous, for the following reasons:


Earwax is sticky. The pressure that it would take to "vacuum" earwax from the ear canal would be so great that it would unfortunately rupture your eardrum. This is because earwax is sticky and doesn't move readily.
Ear candling can deposit candle-wax into your ear. Instead of taking earwax from your ear, candling can easily deposit candle-wax into your ear. That's because you're lighting a candle perilously close to your ear, on a device that funnels into your ear.
Ear candling can be dangerous. There are a host of medical problems waiting to happen as soon as you decide to use an ear candle:The air inside the ear can become so hot that it can burn the inner ear.
The candle can accidentally result in a fire if care is not taken.
The procedure may result in a perforated eardrum.
 Doctors may do this but you should not. Liquids that are thrust into the ear canal may get past the tympanic membrane and cause an ear infection. Liquids that are thrust against the tympanic membrane may cause damage to the inner ear.

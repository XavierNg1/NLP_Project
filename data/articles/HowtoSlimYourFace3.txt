 In order to lose weight, you'll need to get physically active. Plan a workout regimen to help you lose weight overall, which can help you slim down your entire body, including your face.Aerobic activities, like brisk walking, jogging, swimming, or biking, should be a regular part of your workout routine. Choose a form of aerobic activity you enjoy so you'll be more likely to stick to your workouts long-term.
You should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week.
 After a vigorous aerobics workout, stretch. This can help prevent muscle soreness after a workout. Focus on stretching the major muscle groups after cooling down from a jog, a swim, or a long bike ride.Stretch all your major muscle groups, like your legs, arms, shoulders, and back. Hold each stretch for about 30 seconds while breathing deeply.
You may feel some tension when you're stretching. This is normal; however, if you begin to feel pain, you've taken the stretch too far.
 Weight training should also be part of your workout routine. Building muscle can increase lean muscle mass, allowing you to burn calories more efficiently.You can strength train at the gym, using machinery or dumbbells. You can also strength train at home, using your own body for weight.
You should strive to strength train one major muscle group two to three days per week.
Make sure you never strength train the same muscle group two days in a row.
 You want to make sure a workout program is safe for you given your current health and fitness level. Talk to a doctor before beginning any new workout regimen. You and your doctor can find a workout routine safe for you given your current health and your medical history.

 Bad breath is the last thing you want on your mind to worry about. Brush your teeth and floss regularly.


If you expect the moment, pop a mint or chew some gum beforehand.
 She needs to know that you're into her and would welcome her kiss. Make it clear that you would not turn her down--girls get just as nervous about rejection as guys, if not more.


Depending on your relationship, touch her lightly. This could be on her arm, hands, or leg. If you have the opportunity, throw your arm around her and keep her close.
Don't rush. If the relationship is new, take it slow. Good things come to those who wait, after all. She may feel the need to trust you first.
 She needs not to only feel physically comfortable with you, but emotionally comfortable, too. Let her know you want her, not her body.


Insinuate how special she is to you. A compliment can get you a long, long way. You may not want to say this outright--she may not know what to say back. Stick to something like, "I've been wanting to take you here for a really long time. This moment is perfect," to get your point across.
Girls can get kissy if you show them you care. If she's going through a hard time, tell her you want to listen and then do it. Grab her in a romantic hug and take advantage of the moment.

A child with ADHD will have symptoms for at least six months and they will have an effect on the childâ€™s ability to function in school and at home. Symptoms may include:not paying attention or having trouble focusing
not listening when spoken to
not following through on tasks and chores
being easily distracted
losing items, such as pencils, homework, toys, etc.

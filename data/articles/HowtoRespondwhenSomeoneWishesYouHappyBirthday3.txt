 Let the well-wishers know how wonderful they are, and how much you appreciate them. You can use more specific compliments that match your friends', or use these examples:


Thank you, that's such a kind thing to say!
Thank you, you've been a bright and wonderful part of my life.
I'm so lucky to have a group of friends like you.
Give yourselves a pat on the back for being such great friends this past year.
 Let your friends know you appreciate the positive effect they have on your life. Here are a couple examples:


Your message gave me a smile that lasted all day.
It was so wonderful to hear from you. You made my birthday so special.
 If you're posting a mass thank you message on social media, sometimes you want to stand out a little. Try one of the following ideas:


Say something funny, like "It feels great to have so many friends wishing me a happy birthday. You can all have 1/207 of my birthday cake."

Say "Thank you!" in different languages. Try Salamat!, Foole tunk!, or pick your favorites by searching online.
Link to a video. There are many "thank you" videos available online, or you can find a clip from your favorite movie, band, or cute animal acting excited.
 Sometimes, it feels great to communicate your sincere, deep appreciation for a full year of kindness and support. Tweak these examples to include specific events in your life for greater effect:


I feel blessed every day, but most of all on the day when my friends send a flood of support and smiles. Thank you everyone for reminding me what matters on my birthday this year."
It's been a difficult year, but the support of my friends and family made all the difference. My heartfelt thanks to all of you who helped get me back on my feet and face the next year with a smile instead of a frown.

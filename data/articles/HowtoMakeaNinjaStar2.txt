 Use scissors or a sharp utility knife to cut the handle portions off of four plastic picnic-style knives.


Leave roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the handle attached to the serrated blade portion of the knife. This small section of handle will be used to overlap the blades together later in the process.






Discard the rest of the handle.
 Position two of the plastic blades together, allowing them to overlap on the remaining section of handle. Secure them together with clear packing tape.


Note that the blades should face opposite directions. One blade should face left, while the other should face right.
 Tape the other two blades together in the same way you taped the first two.


Overlap the blades at the remaining handle.






Note that one blade should face left while the other faces right.






Tape securely using clear packing tape.
 Place the center of one set over the center of the other set. Tape the sets together using clear packing tape.


Note that all four blades should appear to travel in the same direction.
 Use sharp scissors or a utility knife to shave off plastic at each tip into a 1 inch (2.5 cm) point.

This is not essential, but adding a point to each tip will make allow the ninja star to stick into cardboard and foam targets more effectively.
 Wiggle the flat side of each blade around with your thumb and forefinger. Add more tape, as needed, to secure each blade and prevent it from moving around.

This step completes your ninja star.
Only throw the star at non-living targets like cardboard and foam. Never throw it at people or animals.

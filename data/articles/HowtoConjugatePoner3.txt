 Poner is irregular in the future tense, even though it still has all the same endings as regular -er verbs. The irregularity lies in the fact that you have to change the verb stem from "pon-" to "pondr-.", In Spanish, the future tense doesn't get a helper verb as it does in English. Once you've changed the verb stem for the irregular verb "poner," you simply use the same endings as you would for regular -er verbs.Yo pondré (I will put)
Tú pondrás (you will put)
Él/ella/usted pondrá (he/she/you will put)
Nosotros/as pondremos (we will put)
Vosotros/as pondréis (you all will put)
Ellos/ellas/ustedes pondrán (they/you all will put)

, Unlike English, Spanish doesn't use a helper verb for the conditional tense either. Use the conditional tense when you want to say that you (or someone else) would put something somewhere.Yo pondría (I would put)
Tú pondrías (you would put)
Él/ella/usted pondría (he/she/you would put)
Nosotros/as pondríamos (we would put)
Vosotros/as pondríais (you all would put)
Ellos/ellas/ustedes pondrían (they/you all would put)

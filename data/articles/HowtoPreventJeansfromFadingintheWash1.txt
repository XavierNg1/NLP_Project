 Jeans do not actually need to be washed as regularly as other clothing items. In fact, washing jeans too often can cause them to fade prematurely.You really only need to machine wash jeans once ever 4 to 6 weeks. If you notice any stains during this time frame, you can spot clean with household cleaners rather than throwing the jeans in the wash.;
, This should be a standard practice each time you throw a pair of jeans in with the laundry. Turning the jeans inside out will prevent detergent from wearing as harshly on the dye. Jeans washed inside out will maintain more of their color., If you notice your jeans seem to fade a bit with each wash, use a color protectant detergent. You can buy this at most supermarkets or department stores. You can also opt not to use detergent at all. Vinegar can be used as replacement and may better preserve the color of your jeans.Detergent is meant to eliminate stains but often does not differentiate between stains and dye. Vinegar, on the other hand, will make for a milder wash, cleaning your jeans without removing dye.
Vinegar has a strong smell, however. If you have a sensitive nose, using vinegar may be a bad idea.
 Jeans tend to fade less when washed with other dark clothing. Dark dyes can fade in the wash and swirl around with other clothes. If clothing is packed in together, less dye will fade out. Wait until you have a lot of dark clothes that need washing before washing your jeans., Jeans require a gentle wash and low temperatures to prevent fading. Set your washer for the slowest spin cycle possible and the lowest temperature water. If there's an option for a gentle wash or a hand wash on your washing machine, use it.

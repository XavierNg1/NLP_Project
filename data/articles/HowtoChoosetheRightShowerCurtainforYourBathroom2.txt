 If you want a very decorative bathroom, consider decorative curtains. These curtains usually have a pattern or texture that makes them spruce up a room and are made out of higher quality fabrics. These are usually a good choice for a guest room. Also, as such curtains are more susceptible to damage from moisture, they may work best if you use your bath more than your shower.Decorative curtains are more expensive and difficult to maintain. Therefore, you should only opt for them if you're looking to make a room really stand out for whatever reason. They are not the most practical choice.
 If your bathroom has a more minimalistic design, or if you're going for practicality over decoration, see if you can find a solid color shower curtain. A plain shower curtain that's simply a shade of, say, blue would go great in a bathroom with blue tiles. For simplicity's sake, a solid color curtain will work in most bathrooms when it falls into line with the existing color scheme., You want to make sure your shower curtain does not clash with the existing color scheme. If your bathroom is colored in neutral shades, like whites, you can try adding a splash of color with a brighter curtain. However, if your bathroom already has a strict color scheme, try to choose a curtain to match.For example, say your bathroom has yellow tiles and a yellow sink. Try to pick a curtain in a similar shade, like a yellow polkadot curtain, or a color that pairs well with yellow. A blue curtain, for example, may look nice in a yellow bathroom.
 Your curtain should not just match the colors in your bathroom. Think about things like light fixtures and mirrors in your bathroom. Most hardware in a bathroom is somewhat subtle. However, if you have very large mirrors or very ornate light fixtures, you may want to opt for a plainer curtain. This will prevent the curtain's design from being overwhelming.

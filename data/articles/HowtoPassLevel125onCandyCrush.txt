 Although licorice blockers are resistant to special candies, these candies can help you clear the remaining double jelly squares from the board.Create color bombs by matching five candies of the same color in a row. A color bomb detonates all candies on the board of the same color you match it with.
Create striped candies by matching four candies of the same color in a row. A striped candy wipes out all candies in the same row either horizontally or vertically, depending on the direction in which the stripes on the candies are facing.
Create wrapped candies by matching five candies of the same color in an L shape, T shape, or + shape. A wrapped candy clears out the surrounding eight candies after detonation.

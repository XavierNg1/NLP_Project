 While the basic SlideShare account allows you to upload unlimited presentations, you’ll need one of the three pro level accounts to integrate with your LinkedIn profile. The lowest priced plan (Silver) will allow you to carry out these steps.,


Log in to your LinkedIn profile and go to the Applications page, under the "More" tab. Select the SlideShare app to download.
After adding the app, you have a few options. You can either create a SlideShare account and link it to your LinkedIn profile, or you can link to an existing SlideShare account. To initially link your two accounts, you must use the LinkedIn app. You cannot do this through SlideShare.net. The app will create a SlideShare widget on your LinkedIn public profile that viewers can interact with directly.
 From "My Pro Dashboard", select "Your LinkedIn Dashboard" under "LinkedIn Extras."

, Decide which presentations, videos and documents to display on your LinkedIn profile. Check the box next to the uploaded files you wish to display. You can also select whether or not your videos will play automatically when your profile loads by selecting “Yes” or “No” under "Play Automatically". Viewers will now be able to interact with your presentations directly through your LinkedIn profile.
 The number of views and comments your presentations have received should be available there. You can also view your widget through SlideShare.

If you already own a Beavertail cactus, you can make your own cuttings. To do this, choose pads (the flat, oval-shaped sections that make up a cactus) that are 6 months old or older and cut them at the base. In order to form a callous and prevent rot, cure the cuttings by sitting the pad upright in a dry, dark place for 10 to 14 days.



Prepare a potting mix that is equal parts soil and rough pumice or sand and fill the appropriate number of pots with it. Make sure there are holes in the center of the base of each pot to allow for good drainage.
Set the cuttings upright in the potting mix about an inch (2.5 cm.) deep. If you plant the cuttings too deep, they might rot.
Put some rocks around the pad to anchor it in place.



If you live in an area with strong summer sun, position the cuttings so that the broad sides of the cuttings face east and west while the slim sides face north and south. This will prevent the cuttings from burning during the hottest part of the day.
Make sure the spot is sheltered from any cold winter winds.



Do not water the cutting for the first month. The moisture in the pad will provide enough nutrients for roots to grow. Too much water might cause rot.
After 1 month, roots will have sprouted and you can water the cutting for the first time.
Always let the soil dry before you water the cuttings. Once fully rooted, they are extremely drought resistant.



During the spring, summer, and fall, the Beavertail cactus grows and will benefit from a balanced fertilizer.



From the first pad, many more will form. The second or third pad will bear some flowers, but wait before harvesting them or you might affect the size of future harvests.

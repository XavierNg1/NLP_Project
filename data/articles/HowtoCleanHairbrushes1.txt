 Taking out the old hair is always a good idea, since dirt and skin particles tend to stick to it as it builds up in your brush. Reach in and pinch the hair with your fingers, then pull it out from around the bristles. Keep doing this until you've extracted all of the hair from the brush, then throw the hair away.









If your brush's bristles are made from natural fibers, take care not to yank them out with the hair. Don't bend or break the bristles as you clean the brush.
You can use a pair of tweezers to help you lift the hair from the base of the brush and make it easier to pull off.;
, If your brush just needs to be freshened up quickly, this is the best way to get it clean with very little trouble. While your hair is conditioning in the shower, squirt some shampoo on your brush and use your fingers to gently rub it into the surface of the brush between the bristles.









If you don't want to use up your shampoo, a cheap body wash will work fine for this purpose.
Avoid using conditioner or solid soap, since these will stick to the brush and may be hard to remove.
 When you've finished giving it a light scrub, hold the brush under the stream of running water from the showerhead until it's thoroughly rinsed off. Make sure to get every last bit of soap, since you don't want it to stay on the brush and cause your hair to get sticky later when you brush it.
 You can use the cool setting on your blow dryer to dry the brush, or simply set it out on a towel and let it dry overnight. When the brush is completely dry, it's ready to use again.









Don't use a hot hair dryer to dry the brush. This could damage the base of the brush and its bristles.
Avoid using the brush when it's still wet, especially if it's made with natural bristles. This could cause them to bend and break.

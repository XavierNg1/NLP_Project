 Vanity and bed shall go in the bedroom, and the bathtub-couch in the living room. Also, a suitcase and a zebra rug shall also be in the living room. Keep your vintage telephone in the suitcase when not in use. Keep only high-heels or ballet slippers and a pint of milk in your refrigerator.;

As a nightgown, wear an extra large tuxedo shirt, and complete the look with tassel earplugs, a sleep mask, and teased hair with bangs pulled back.
For evenings, wear a black, floor-length, high-neck, sleeveless evening gown, with pumps, and a multi-strand pearl necklace with brooch, and a diamond tiara in up swept hair.
When hanging around the house, pair an oversize gray sweater with very dark skinny jeans, with your hair wrapped in a towel.
When going out during the day for recreation (ex. shopping, the library, museums), you could either go with something simple such as a plain black turtle neck top with either black leggings, dark jeggings or light (tan) trousers and bulky earring with your hair pinned up or at least out of your face, or you could wear a bright two-piece suit with a mod coat and hat, or your hair in a scarf. When meeting someone during the day, wear a tea-length, 'Little Black Dress', with black pumps, pearl earrings, and a large 1960s hat.
When partying, drape a curtain-toga around yourself. Another going-out outfit, is a sparkling pink dress (a-line tea-length) with a pink tiara in up swept hair. Always wear big black sunglasses when not at home.

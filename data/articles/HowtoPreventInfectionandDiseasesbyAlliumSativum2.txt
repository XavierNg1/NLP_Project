 One of the areas in which garlic seems most effective is cancer prevention. According to numerous medical journals (American Chinese Medicine, Science, Journal of Urology) garlic can reduce even malignant tumours. Garlic raises the immune system's level of response in defending the body, particularly against certain types of cancers including breast, stomach, colon and skin cancers.

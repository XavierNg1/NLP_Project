 On your screen, you should see a bunch of green stuff. This is your HUDÂ 

,


Starting clockwise at the top is your speed in knots. next at the top is your heading like a compass. to the far right of the screen is a small button which says 'Exit flight simulator'. Click on this if you want to exit the simulator completely. Below that is a number at the top of some lines that says 0. This will change and it is your vertical speed in feet per minute. Sometimes it will go negative, meaning you are going down.
Below that is your altitude in feet above sea level. Right now it should be at 4320.
In the center of the screen is an arc with some other stuff. This is your main HUD. The arc is your bank angle. The parallel lines are the pitch angle in degrees, so if it says 90 then you're pointed straight up and are stalling.
At the bottom left hand corner will be a box. The left side is the throttle. the top side is the aileron. The right side is the elevator, and the bottom is the rudder.
Above this is currently nothing but this is where your flap indicator will be in percent and your landing gear status will be. The SR22 has fixed gear so you don't have to worry about that.

 Stand beside the bike you’ll be riding and adjust both the seat (or “saddle”) and the handlebars so that they are level with the top of your hip bones. You’re not done yet though. Bend one of your arms 90 degrees and make a fist. Touch the front of your knuckles to the center of your handlebars, with your elbow pointing directly towards the saddle. Adjust the saddle so that its front touches the back of your elbow., You may still need to adjust the bike further, but get in the saddle to feel it out after setting the right saddle and handlebar heights. As you sit in the saddle, rotate the pedals slowly. When the pedal on one side is all the way down, make sure the leg on that side has only a slight bend. Shoot for 25 to 35 degrees.When the pedals are level with one another, one knee should be directly above the forward pedal. If not, re-adjust the saddle forward or backward, as necessary.
On a recumbent bike (which are much less common, but are still available at some facilities) the leg extending on a stroke should only be bent 10 to 15 degrees, while the leg on the rear pedal should make a 90-degree angle.
 Make sure you can reach your handlebars comfortably, with an upright back and open chest. Your shoulder should be relaxed and your elbows should be slightly bent. In a comfortable, safe position, you won’t feel pressure on your back, knees, or wrists. If your position is uncomfortable in any way, or if your shoulders or back are rounded, ask the instructor for help with adjustments.


Your handlebars may be too low, or tilted forward detrimentally, if your back is uncomfortable.
If you have recurring back, neck, or shoulder pain, set your handlebars a bit higher and scoot the saddle forward to sit more upright.

 Bella is known for her checked shirts and plaid shirts, so buy a few that you like. You can get them in many colours and sizes and they suit anyone and everyone. Bella also wears simple, long-sleeved shirts in dark colours like blue, grey, brown and sometimes even green.
 Jeans are what she always wears, because Bella's style is so comfortable and laid-back. Buy a few different pairs of jeans that fit perfectly. Buy some jeans in different washes for variety.
 Bella loves easy-to-wear, comfortable shoes such as Converse, Keds and other "sneaker"-style shoes. She usually wears them in solid, dark colours such as black, grey, and navy blue.
 Although Bella is more of a tomboy with her clothing, she gets more feminine as the series progresses. In Breaking Dawn Part 1, she certainly looks more elegant in what she wears. She wears sophisticated dresses such as the one pictured above. Consider buying a simple dress that will suit your figure and fit you well. Because Bella doesn't wear bright colours, opt for a dress in ivory/white, black, or navy blue.

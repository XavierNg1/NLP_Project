 Parades can be stressful, and often the best option is to leave him at home in a crate or room, as described in the section on parties. If you don’t want to leave your dog alone, another option is to leave him with friends or family not attending. However, if you do decide to bring your dog with you, follow the steps below to keep your dog as calm and safe as possible.
 These include:


A crate for securing your dog.
A secure leash and collar. A harness or controlling item such as a head collar might be preferred, as your dog may pull.
A muzzle. This is a necessary safety precaution, as the sights and sounds of a parade can distress your dog to the point of biting.
A collapsible water bowl and water. Your pet must be kept hydrated, as should you.
 Though you likely won’t be able to follow through a complete desensitization due to lack of time, you can introduce your dog gradually – at first, simply allow him to adjust to the sight, smell, and noise of the crowd at a closer and closer distance, and the parade using the same rules.
 You should only bring a dog to a parade if he has been obedience trained, but even if he has been, keep a closer eye on your dog than usual. Watch for signs that your dog is uneasy or upset; if the parade upsets your dog too much, you can take him away from the parade or, if possible, set up a crate in a secure location.
 Keeping your dog in a car is never a safe option, as the heat can give your dog heatstroke – or even kill him – and water must be provided regularly to prevent heat stroke and keep your dog hydrated.

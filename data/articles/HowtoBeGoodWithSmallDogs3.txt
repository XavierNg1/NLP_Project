 You may start with commands like “come” and “sit.” You may also teach your dog to “stay” so she does not move or jump around without your permission.


These basic commands can be useful for keeping your small dog calm when you take her for walks or when you have a play session. Having a well trained dog will also make it easier for others to interact with her and have a positive experience around your dog.
 You can also teach your dog how to “place” or stay in one spot on your command. The “place” cue can be useful for small dogs who tend to get too excited and jumpy when someone is at the door or when they meet someone new.


To teach your dog to “place”, you will need a new mat, towel, or bed. You will then work with your dog to help her learn how to go to the mat or towel and stay on it at your command.

 The type of wire or cord and the type of beads depend on what you would like to do. Are your projects going to be intricate and costly, or inexpensive and simple? Are you going to give these works of art away, sell them, or are they a self-project? Are your projects going to be just beads, or would you like to incorporate charms, pendants, bead holders, knots, etc.?;
, You might even be able to recycle old jewelry, or stage jewelry if you want to. Get beads that you like the most and that you feel will be easiest and most fun to work with; Also make sure you get enough for your purposes so that you don't run out of beads in the middle of a wonderful creation!

, Make sure that whatever you choose to string your beads or charms on can fit through the bead/charm holes:
-String/Twine/Thread (doubled or single line)
-Wire (thin or thick)
-Hemp
-Clear plastic line or fishing line
-Ribbons (silk, fiber, synthetic, etc.)
-Stretchy cord (good for bracelets!)
-Other materials

, You could even tie it around a bead and secure the ends that way. A tiny spot of superglue on the knot does wonders. You could also incorporate clasps, lobster-claw clasps, etc.

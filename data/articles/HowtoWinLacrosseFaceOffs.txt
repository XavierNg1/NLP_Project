 It's kind of a game of chance, unless your hands are fast enough. If you have fast hands, it doesn't matter what move the other player uses, you will win.;
, The clamp is the most basic move in lacrosse face offs. You simply push the head of your stick forward on top of the ball. The clamp will beat the rake if both face off midfielders are about evenly matched in their reaction time.
 Raking the ball in a face off means using the part of the head that is touching the ground to "rake" the ball out in front of you. If the other player tries to top you, you can rake the ball right under their stick.
 Topping the ball means bringing the head of your stick over the top of the ball and scooping the ball backwards behind you. The top will beat the clamp because your stick moving over the top of the ball will push the other player's stick out of the way.
 After you push the ball wherever you want it, you want to use your body to make sure the other face off player can't get it, and if they do get it, they will have to foul you in order to. For example, if you rake the ball behind you, spin your legs around so that the other player is behind you and the ball is in front of you. Or if you push the ball in front of you, swing your leg around the other player to "box" them out of the range of the ball.

 It is exhausting for your eyes to focus on the screen for long periods of time, but unfortunately, it can be hard to escape in today's day and age. Stand up and take a walk around during lunch break to give your eyes a chance to look around and focus on other things without having a screen right in front of them. This will make it much more manageable to get through your day with less strain on your eyes.


Give your eyes a break by following the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes look at an object at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds.



Also, to reduce the harmful effects of screen time that cannot be avoided (such as on your computer at work), try positioning the screen lower and using an anti-glare screen to diminish the strain on your eyes.
 Try this once in the morning, once in the evening, and any time during the day that you feel your eyes are particularly sore or strained. Cold water has a soothing effect that can help your eyes to relax.


Another option is to apply cold cucumber slices over each eye, and to leave them on for 5-10 minutes. The coolness, as well as the chance to relax your eyes by keeping them shut, can make a noticeable difference.
 If you are having continued eye strain that is bothering you in your day-to-day life, consult your physician. It is possible that you have a vision problem, or another eye condition, that may be contributing to the discomfort and/or tension you feel. It is always better to be safe rather than sorry, and to see a doctor to ensure that nothing more serious is going on (as well as to obtain appropriate medical treatment if needed).

 A strong spray can knock off bugs from the leaves of your plants. If your herbs are too delicate, use the strongest setting on a spray bottle.
 Keeping the area healthy and clean will allow you to spot bugs more easily. It will also attract fewer bugs.
 It may take as little as 1 night for the bugs to produce holes and begin to change the color of the leaves. Some plants respond by growing slowly and producing fewer leaves.

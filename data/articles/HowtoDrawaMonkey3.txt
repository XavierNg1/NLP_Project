 Sketch in guidelines for the facial features.
 Don't draw the mouth too close to the nose; you can make it big or small depending on your preference.
 Detail it if you want, or just draw another curved line inside.
, Give it a curve like the tail shown in the image, or curl it around a branch so it looks like your monkey is hanging from a tree.
 Make them long, maybe as long as the body. You can also make it a little chubby to make it look cuter.
 Monkeys don't need their legs nearly as much as their arms, since they spend their lives swinging around using their hands and tails, not their feet.
 The difference is that the palms are a little longer if you want to make it a little realistic. If not, just draw a circle and ovals for the fingers.
 If you want to add fur, you should do so at this point.
 Add shading/shadowing if you want, mostly using whatever color you primarily used for the fur.

 In a vacuum filler pen, there is a plunger that remains inside the barrel. Removing the knob will free the plunger to move up and down. Pull up the plunger to create a vacuum inside the pen. Then push the plunger down.


As the plunger reaches the wider, flared part of the pen, it will break the vacuum and cause ink to be drawn into the barrel., A lever pen will have a have a lever in the middle of the pen to compress a sac. To fill the pen, first lift the lever, then dip the nib in ink. Push the lever back into place and wait for a few seconds. Then, snap the lever back into place.You might need repeat this step a couple times until the pen fills.
 A button filler pen uses a button to compress a sac, which then creates suction to draw ink into the pen. To fill, take off the blind cap on the end of the pen. Push and hold the button down, compressing the sac. Dip the nib into the ink, then release the button to fill the pen.

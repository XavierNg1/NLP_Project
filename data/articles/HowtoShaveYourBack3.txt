 Shaving your own back is doable, but risky, and a pair of helping hands will make the process much easier than doing it all by yourself. Make sure that you trust the person, and that you are very close. Consider asking your significant other, if you're in a fairly serious relationship. If you're single, you might try asking a close friend. You may even find it easier to pay a professional for the job.
 If you have electric clippers, this step is as simple as having your friend plug in the clippers and trim down the hair on your back. If you don't have clippers handy, have your friend use a comb and scissors to trim down your hair. Removing the thick hair first should make shaving your back quicker and easier. Rinse off afterwards. Hop into the shower and rinse the trimmed hair off of your back. Once you've rinsed off any loose hairs, you are ready to start shaving.
 Before you shave, ask your friend to rub shaving cream onto your back. Make sure that they cover the entire area that you want to be shaved.
 Be sure that your friend is not applying too much or too little pressure while shaving your back. Have him or her rinse the razor after each stroke for more effective shaving.


For the smoothest shave, your friend should be shaving in the opposite direction of your hair growth.
Don't go over the same spot too many times. Over-shaving may cause a rash or cut.
 Once your back is shaved, hop in the shower and rinse off the excess shaving cream. Gently towel dry. Rub lotion into your skin to keep your shaved back from stinging or drying out. Be sure to thank your shaving partner for the favor!


Check in the mirror to make sure that your friend didn't miss a spot. Reapply shaving cream and shave off any spots that might have been missed.

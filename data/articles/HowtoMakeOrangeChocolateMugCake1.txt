 Set half of a small orange with the end trimmed in a glass measuring cup. Pour enough water over the orange so the cup is filled to the 1 cup (237 ml) mark.Use a microwave-safe measuring cup that holds at least 1 pint (473 ml).;
, After you’ve covered the orange with water, cover the measuring cup loosely with plastic wrap. Heat the mixture in the microwave on high for 30 to 45 seconds, or until the orange is soft. Afterward, drain the water from the cup.If the orange still isn’t soft after 45 seconds, heat it in 10 second intervals to avoid overheating it.
 After the orange is softened, place it in a food processor. Pulse it until the orange is finely chopped. Allow the orange to cool for 5 minutes., Once the orange is cooled, add ¼ cup (31 g) of all-purpose flour, 3 tablespoons (18 g) of almond flour, 3 tablespoons (38 g) of sugar, 2 tablespoons (28 g) of melted butter, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of baking powder, a pinch of kosher salt, and a large egg to the food processor. Pulse the mixture until it is fully blended.You can use egg substitute in place of the egg if you prefer.
 When the batter is fully blended, pour it into a microwave-safe mug. Add 1 ½ tablespoons (16 g) of dark chocolate chips to it, and gently stir them in.You can substitute semisweet or milk chocolate chips for the dark chocolate if you prefer.
Be sure to use a mug that holds between 1 ¼ and 1 ½ cups (295 to 354 ml).
 Place the mug with the batter in the microwave, and heat it on high for about 2 minutes.The cake will rise above the rim of the mug as it heats.You can be sure that the cake is cooked through by inserting a toothpick into the center. It should come out just barely clean.
As the cake cools, it will sink back down into the mug.
 When the mug cake is finished heating, remove it from the microwave. Let it cool for 20 minutes before sprinkling some powdered sugar over it to garnish it.If you like you can also garnish the cake with some chocolate chips or chocolate syrup.

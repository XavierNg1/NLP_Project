 If you just painted your nails, wipe it off using a hard, pointed object, like a cuticle pusher or a toothpick. If the nail polish won't come off, wait until it dries before continuing.
 Choose a brush with stiffer bristles, such as a lipstick brush. Make sure that you won't be using this brush for anything else again.
 You can also use acetone instead. It is harsher and more drying than nail polish remover, but it works faster.
 Try not to get the metal crimp wet, or the glue holding the bristles will melt. This is especially important if you are using acetone.
 You can do this by sweeping the bristles across the rim of the bottle. If you have too much nail polish remover on your brush, it may drip onto your nails and ruin your manicure.
 Always tilt your finger towards the brush. This will help keep the nail polish remover from dripping onto your manicure. For example, if you got nail polish on the left side of your finger, tilt your finger slightly to the left. If you get too much nail polish remover on your finger, it will drip down the side of your finger instead of onto your manicure.
 Fold a tissue in half, and wipe it around the cuticle area of your nail. This will pick up any residual nail polish remover.
 There are a few things you can do to prevent nail polish from getting on your fingers the next time you paint your nails. The most common are to outline your nails with Vaseline or white school glue. These create a barrier between your skin and the nail polish, making clean up a lot easier.Use a Q-tip to apply Vaseline to the skin around your nails before starting your manicure. Once you are done painting your nails, wipe the Vaseline off with another Q-tip.
Draw a thin line around your nails using white school glue. Let the glue dry, then paint your nails. Peel the dried glue off when you are done with your manicure.

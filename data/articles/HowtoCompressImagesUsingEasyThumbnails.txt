 It's great to include images in your how to articles, but there are few things you need to consider before uploading your images. The first thing is format. Should it be a .gif? A .jpg? A .png? For this how-to, we are going to save our image as a .jpg file.;
, You need to be considerate of those using dial-up connections to the internet. An image with a 120K file size will take forever for their browser to download.
 And since your how-to article will more than likely also include text, you will want your image to be no more than half that size.
 Be advised that Easy Thumbnails is a Microsoft Windows only application. Mac and Linux users will have to find a different application.
 1, make sure that "Files of Type" (1) is set to "All Images". Under "Look In" (2), browse your way to the directory where you keep your images saved. Then under that (3), single click on the image you want to edit. You will see the image come up on the right hand side. Click the "..." button under "Save in" (4), and browse to the directory where you want your images saved. Now click on the settings tab.
 2, click the tab "Preview Output" (5) so you can see what the changes are going to look like as you're making them. Under the settings tab, change the "Max width" (1)and "Max height" (2) values. Its best to stay around 400 pixels. Then change "Resize" (3) to "Shrink to fit".
 Under "JPEG quality" (4), drag the slider to the lowest value possible until the image starts to look like total crap. Bring the slider back up a bit if the image looks too nasty.
, Click the button "Make" (6). Your image has been saved in the directory you picked. That's it! Upload your images to wikiHow using the Toolbox.

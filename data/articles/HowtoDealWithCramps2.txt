 Women who incorporate regular exercise into their routines have less severe cramps than women who don't exercise.Consider adding exercise to your life in one of the following ways:


Walk or bike to work. Walking or biking can take less time than other modes of transportation, and the light exercise it entails adds up a lot over time.
Start jogging or swimming a few times a week. Jogging and swimming keep your muscles toned and give your body a strong, healthy foundation, which helps keep cramps at bay.
Join a team sport. Basketball, soccer, softball and volleyball get you moving several times a week.
 Have you every noticed that your cramps are more painful during periods when you're drinking a lot of coffee? That's because caffeine has an effect on the severity and duration of muscle cramps, as do alcohol and salt.Limit your intake of the following substances, especially as your period approaches:


Coffee, caffeinated tea, and soda.
Beer, wine, liquor, and other drinks containing alcohol.
Salty foods like chips, canned soups, and fast food.
 For people with severe menstrual cramps and other menstruation-related symptoms, taking birth control can help ease the pain. The hormones in birth control cause the uterine lining to thin, resulting in fewer uterine contractions and less severe cramps. Consider the following options:


The birth control pill is a popular method. A pill containing a certain amount of estrogen, progesterone or both is taken each day until the end of the cycle, when the period comes.
Injectable contraceptives contain the same hormones, and are administered in the form of a shot periodically.
Intra-uterine devices, or IUDs, are implanted inside the cervix. The device releases estrogen and progesterone hormones.

 Make sure it is small enough that it will fit in your locker. Try using an empty jewelry box or an unused Chinese take-out box. Decorate your container with photos, stickers, or colorful permanent markers.;
, Consider:


Pads/tampons
Painkillers/headache medicine (if you are allowed to self-administer over-the-counter drugs)
Essential makeup (foundation, eyeliner, cover-up)
Money
Bandages
Tissues
Comb
Extra pencils and pens
Compact mirror
Hair ties
Hand lotion

 It helps when you are going to class and need to write things down. It is also useful to keep a binder in case your papers fall apart. Teachers appreciate things more when all the papers are together!

, When you are going to class, you can get hungry. You can pack anything small except gum, but nothing that will go bad and stink up your locker! Good snacks are:


Almonds
Trail Mix
Rockets (Out of the wrapper)
Raisins
Nuts

, Have a bit of extra supplies like erasers, tape, sharpeners, and lined paper.
 In winter your socks may get wet and uncomfortable, and in art class your shirt may become a disaster. Make sure to have extra pants and underwear if a little surprise period pops up when you're not prepared! Something to change into may come in really handy!

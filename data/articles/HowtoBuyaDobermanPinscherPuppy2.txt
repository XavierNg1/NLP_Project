 Your potential new puppy's health is of great importance. Ask the breeder if the mother of the litter is up to date with her vaccines, since puppies get their early immunity to disease directly from their mother. Inquire about any possible genetic defects (from the mother or the father), and ask if the puppy will be seen by a vet before it is sold., Ask your breeder if they offer a guarantee, more specifically with regard to the health of the animal (i.e. if the puppy is found to have a severe illness, what will they do?) See if they will cover veterinary expenses, or offer you another puppy from the litter in such an event. This question is sometimes an uncomfortable one to ask, so be as straightforward as possible by saying, "Can you tell me if you offer any guarantee with the sale of this puppy?" and opening up the discussion., Do not hesitate to ask a breeder for references from other people who have purchased puppies from them. A good, experienced breeder will have no trouble producing a reference, and might even ask you for references as well to determine what kind of pet owner you will be. As an added bonus, getting references creates an opportunity to communicate with other Doberman Pinscher owners who may be able to offer additional advice and guidance about your new pet.

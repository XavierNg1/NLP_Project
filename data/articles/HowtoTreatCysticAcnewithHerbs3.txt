 Cystic acne (and non-cystic acne) is also sometimes triggered by stress. Stress triggers a change in hormones, which can increase the amount of oil the skin produces. The result is an increase in pimples.


To keep stress from making your cystic acne worse, take measures to reduce it in your daily life.Find ways to relax, get more rest, etc.
Exercise is a good way to release the emotions associated with stress.
 Smelling pleasant, soothing scents can relax you, sometimes instantly. Scents trigger your olfactory system, which sends signals to the part of your brain that controls emotions. In this portion of the brain, chemicals that make the body feel good are released.Aromatherapy can reduce stress to prevent a cystic acne outbreak.


Use fresh lavender sprigs in a bath to release the scent. Soak for 20 minutes.Drink a cup of chamomile tea, lemon balm tea, hawthorn tea, or passionflower tea.
Keep a sachet of dried passionflower leaves, roots, and petals near your pillow to help you sleep. You can also place the sachet in a warm bath.
 Use herbal supplements in pill or capsule form to reduce stress. Taking these supplements at bedtime will also help you sleep. Just donâ€™t take more than one kind of herb at the same time. An herb like valerian root relaxes your body for sleep. #*Consume valerian root capsules at bedtime or during times of high stress during the day.

 Such as when they are at work, at school, sleeping, or gone out. If not possible, simply go into a room with a lock and hide under a blanket.;
, Make sure it is yours because you don't want to mess up someone else's present by accident.
 This will help when you put it back together. If possible, take a photo of the present pre-unwrapping.
 Most wraps are translucent, so you have a hint of what you got for Christmas. Also, if you already have a prediction of what you might be getting, feel around the package for any textures that might give it away. Take care not to feel around too hard or you might rip the wrapping paper.
 Don't completely sever the tape; use the knife or scissors to lift the edge of the tape away from the paper. Only do this on one side. Or simply use your fingers to carefully remove the tape. Replace the tape after you have seen the present. If you cut the tape, put another piece over the cut to make it less obvious.
 If you are lucky, you can see the present from one side. If not, carefully slide it out, don't rip the gift wrap. If you are having trouble don't unwrap it. Only because it may be obvious that you opened it.
 After you have seen the gift, put it back exactly how it was. Wrap the gift and tape it back up. Try not to leave any signs of tampering, and make sure to be very quiet.

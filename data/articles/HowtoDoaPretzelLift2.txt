 To begin, start by lifting your ankle so that your heel is above your hip. Hold it for a few seconds before lowering the leg. Repeat a few times. As you do this, squeeze your thighs and glutes. “Pulse” these muscles by squeezing and releasing them in quick succession.If this part is difficult for you, you may want to practice it a bit more before progressing with the rest of the exercise. Do it for two minutes on either side a few times a week. When you are more comfortable with it, you can advance to the full lift.
 Lean forward and lightly rest on your fingertips. Lift the back leg just an inch or two off the ground. Start moving the leg up and down in this position; do not let it touch the ground. These movements are small, slow, and controlled.As you do this movement, the rest of your body should remain absolutely still. Keep your spine long and straight.


Do not let the back leg travel forward while doing this motion. The thigh and knee should remain behind the hip at all times.
 After about ten reps, you will want to switch legs. Before you do so, however, you should stretch the worked leg. This will relieve tension in that leg and help you transition safely to the other leg.You can return to a normal seated position, with your legs straight in front of you. Lean forward to touch your toes with both arms.
You can also do a side stretch, by keeping the front leg bent in front of your body. Stretch the worked leg out to the side, and lean over to touch your toes.
 You should try to do two sets of ten repetitions each for each leg.However, if you cannot do this many at first, try doing more sets with fewer reps, and rest for 10 to 15 seconds in between.

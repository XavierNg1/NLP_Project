 Place the Xbox upside down. Put your finger in the flip-opened hole, and pull. You’ll probably have to give it a good tug.;
, Six tabs, hidden behind the white side venting holes, hold the gray lower grill on the case. Use your case opening tool or a small screwdriver to pop these tabs, one at a time, and remove the lower grill carefully. You will want to start at the front end, where you removed the faceplate, as there is a good place to grab the grill to lift it away.
 Pull off the hard drive, if you haven’t already. You will see that this side is not flat, but rather contains a small step where the hard drive fits in. You will have to pop the two tabs which are placed along the ledge before proceeding to the others. Now, pop the two tabs which are visible on the white sides, as in the previous step. You will find the final tab hidden under one of the rubber feet. There is a seal on this tab, which will tell Microsoft if you have broken your warranty.

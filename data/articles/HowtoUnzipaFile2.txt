 Double clicking the zipped (.zip) file will automatically activate your Mac's built-in extractor program and the zipped files will automatically be unzipped.


To choose an extractor program other than the default, click the zipped folder while holding down the "Command" (Apple) button. This will pull up a list from which you can select "Open With" and choose your preferred extractor program.
 If you use Mac's default program the unzipped files will be in the same folder with the same name as the original zipped folder. If there is more than one file present they will be number consecutively, foldername1, foldername2, etc.

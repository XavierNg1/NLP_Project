 Choose a pan large enough to also hold the paper you plan to dye. Don't worry if you aren't sure how many grounds to add, you can always add more to strengthen the coffee as it steeps.
 Allow the water and coffee grounds to steep at least five minutes. If the resulting liquid isn't dark enough, add more grounds and allow it to steep a few minutes more.
 How long you allow the paper to steep is completely up to you, depending on how dark you want the paper to be stained. Various projects could require paper to steep anywhere from five minutes to overnight.









If you would like to create symmetrical stained designs, fold the paper into squares, triangles or strips before placing it in the liquid.
 Wait until the paper is just a shade or two lighter than what you desire, then remove it from the coffee. The paper will darken a shade or two more as it dries.
 You can clip it to a clothesline or a curtain rod. Be careful as you handle the paper, since it will be more fragile while itâ€™s wet. Drying time can vary based on the type of paper and where it's hanging. You can test it with your hand to know when its fully dried.


If you're not satisfied with the shade once the paper dries, simply repeat steps 3-5.

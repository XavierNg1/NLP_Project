 Send a text to your partner, friend, or family member, casually describing a major task you need them to do. For example:


"Hi, some internet friends from (distant country) are in town, but I decided to relax today. I told them you could show them around instead, maybe drive them to (nearby city)? They'll be at your house soon."
(To a friend about to return from vacation) "Welcome home! Thanks for letting me stay in your house. I'm borrowing your clothes for a few more days, but I'll return the stained ones by the end of the week."

, Have a text conversation, but ignore all the replies from the other person. Instead, send this sequence of messages, waiting for at least thirty seconds between each one.


Hey, where are you?
Yeah, almost ready.
I don't think he knows anything. It's happening in a few minutes.
You definitely said grapefruit juice.
Susan's bringing the ramp.
Wait, is this going to (other person's name) too? Cancel everything, we'll move it to next week.
 Ask silly questions, or riddles with trick answers:


"If a cat always lands on its feet, and toast always lands butter-side-down, what happens when you tie toast to a cat's back?""If a plane crashes in Antarctica, in what country are the survivors buried?" (Answer: Why do you want to bury a survivor?), Visit an upside-down text flipper, and type in your message. This will convert your message into upside-down text. Not all chat programs, email applications, and browsers can display these characters, so the person you send it too might only see a row of squares or question marks.

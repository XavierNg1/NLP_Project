 They should both be shaped like a one armed man and roughly two feet apart (.6 m).


Carve them into peg shapes beforehand to drill them into the ground more easily.
Place their "arms" parallel to each other. You will use the armpits as a source of support for the necessary tension.
 It should be, again, two feet or so apart from the other two, forming a triangle.


This stick does not have to be any particular shape but semi-straight.
 Using your same wire, make sure the stick is securely in place in the armpits of the two original sticks.
 Just like in the hook method, it should be 6-12 in (15-30 cm) from the top, depending on the strength of the tree.


Test everything before you assume it's secure. A struggling animal will not go easy on your trap.
Tie your wire around a rock and throw over a sturdy tree limb if easier or more convenient. The rock should dangle above the ground and emulate the same methods used with the sapling.
 This is your trigger point. Knot your wire and then knot it again.


A stick that is around 4 in (10 cm) is long enough. Hold it under the stick that's in the armpit of the first two, wire tugged tight in front. It uses the tension between the cord and armpitted stick to stay where it is when propped up.
 This will be the stick that gets hit, falls, and pulls up the sapling. It is propped up between the smallest stick and the peg, just waiting for trouble.


This is a balancing act. Make sure it's centered near perfectly or a breeze could knock it off kilter.
 The noose will follow the small stick flying in the air when an animal walks across its path.


Use small pebbles or twigs to widen the noose, lowering the possibility of your target just tripping the snare and escaping.
Place your bait within the noose. Choose whatever bait appeals to the type of game you are aiming to catch.

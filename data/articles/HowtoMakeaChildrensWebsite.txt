,, HTML is a code made to form websites, and CSS is what you will need to design the layout for your website.
 There should be an option once you made your account called "File manager". Enter your file manager, and you should see something called 'index.html'. Select 'edit' to edit your index.html. The index is the page people will see when they first enter your site. Tweak the index.html page to your liking, make sure to provide links and lots of information to the topic on your website.

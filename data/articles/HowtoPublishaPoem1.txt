 By reaching out to magazines and literary journals, you are also reaching out to editors, agents, and other poets. You may be rejected at first—it's almost a rite of passage for creative types—but if you continue to send out good poetry, they will get to know you, and you will start to see your work published.


Finding the right match for you will help you get published. Remember, most editors are swamped with submissions, so if you give them what they're looking for, you'll have the advantage over everyone else.

Look to newspapers, magazines, civic organizations and other national contest organizations, as well. They often list poetry writing contests with various awards for best submissions.
Placing your work with these sources will gain you a valuable recognition.

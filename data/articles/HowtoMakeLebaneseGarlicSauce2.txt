 of garlic cloves in a food processor and add 2 tsp. (9.85 ml) of salt.


Pulse the garlic until it is minced and fine. Remember to stop between pulses to scrape down the sides of the food processor. You do not want to end up with large clumps of garlic in your sauce.
 You will want to add about 1/2 a cup (4 oz.) at a time, ultimately using 4 cups (32 oz.) of oil.
 (9.85 ml) of lemon juice after every 1/2 cup (4 oz.) of oil. Continue to let the food processor run while you are adding the oil and lemon juice.



Scrape all of the sauce out of the food processor into a bowl. Add salt to taste and refrigerate.

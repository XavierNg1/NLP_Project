 When your car is parked, you can put these shades in the windshield to prevent the car from heating up too much. The shades block out direct sunlight. Be aware that in the height of summer, the car will still be warm, but the inside of the car will not take as long to cool down for you and your dog.
 Your dog will need to be hydrated during the journey. If you are going on a long car trip, make sure to take regular breaks every hour or two to give your dog water. Bring along a travel dish or a collapsible water dish. Pour water in from a water bottle, and let your dog drink until they are satisfied., Even if you donâ€™t need the A/C, your dog might. Proper ventilation and air flow is important for your dog in the car. If your dog is traveling in a crate, make sure that the air can reach them. The crate should have holes, and the air flow should be unobstructed towards the crate.If your A/C does not work, you can also crack a window while the car is moving. Do not let your dog stick their head out of the window.
 Even if you park in the shade and leave the windows open, the internal temperature of your car can spike very quickly to dangerous levels. Do not leave your dog in the car, even for just a few minutes. Leave them at home when you need to go to the store. If you are traveling with them, keep them close at all times.

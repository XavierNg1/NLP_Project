 The basic equation that most people use to figure out how fast something is going is very easy to use. The first thing you'll need to know is how far the object traveled. In other words, how far is its starting point from its ending point?


This equation will be easier to understand with an example. Let's say that we are making a trip in a car to a theme park 100 miles away (about 161 kilometers). In the next few steps, we'll use this information to solve our equation.;
, The next piece of information you'll need is how long the object took as it traveled. In other words, how long did it take to get from its starting point to its ending point?


In our example, let's say that it took us almost exactly two hours to make our journey.
 All you need are these two pieces of information to find your speed for the trip. The distance over the time will give you the object's speed.


In our example, 100 miles/2 hours = 50 miles/hour (about 80 kilometers/hour).
 Labelling your answer with the proper units (like miles per hour, etc.) is critical. Without units, it can be hard for other people to understand what your answer means. You may also lose points if you're making this calculation for schoolwork.


Your units for speed will be your distance units over your time units. In our example, since we measured distance in miles and time in hours, our units are miles/hour (or "miles per hour").

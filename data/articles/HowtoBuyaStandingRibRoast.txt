 Standing rib roasts are expensive in relation to other meats, and because of this, you should be selective about your purchase. Avoid purchasing a precut or prepackaged roast.
 Most butchers recommend one rib portion for every two diners. As an example, if you have six diners, three ribs should be sufficient, and for 10 diners, you would need five ribs. Inform your butcher of how many ribs you will need when ordering., This may require the butcher to place a special order to get it, but if you don't demand prime grade, you could wind up getting "beef bone in roast," which is generally priced the same but a lower quality of cut. If you're going to pay for an elite cut of beef, make sure you're getting your money's worth., Also, request the meat be cut away from the rib bones but placed back on top of the bones before packing. This pre-cutting will make carving the finished meat much easier., Shorter ribs will make it easier to place the roast in the oven to cook., The meat should be vibrant red, and be free from browned or dried-out edges, which are sure indicators the cut is old. Before leaving the store, be sure the packaging of the roast is airtight and sealed to maintain optimal freshness of the roast until you are ready to cook it.

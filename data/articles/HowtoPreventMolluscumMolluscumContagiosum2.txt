Scratching and picking at the lesions can spread the virus to other parts of your body and to others.
Do not shave over the area with the lesions. This will only irritate them further.
You do not need to wear bandages over the mollucum lesions when there is no risk of coming in contact with others, such as you are sleeping or when you are alone at home. Keeping the lesions uncovered can help to keep your skin healthy.

 Though an angry face depends mostly on the eyebrows, you can still add to it with the face. Draw a rainbow shape, but slightly leaning to the side. Repeat on the bottom.
 Draw a squiggle, then draw a straight line underneath. Feel free to add a tongue and/or teeth.
 It is very easy to do, and is good for a bully or a joker. Simply draw a slightly curved line, then draw a tongue sticking out of it.

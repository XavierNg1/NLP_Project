To kill: when you play a card higher than any of those on the table.
To go: when playing in pairs, this expression is used when you play a low card ("I'm going to you" is the full expression)
To draw: when you're tied with an opponent
To make the first: when you're sure you've won the first hand (phase)
Be loaded: when you have high value cards
Enough: a synonym of "Envido" that's used when you can't say that word
To be blind: when you don't have any high value cards
I'll pass: when you no longer want to play this hand (you put your unplayed cards facedown)
Hand in hand: a 2-player game.

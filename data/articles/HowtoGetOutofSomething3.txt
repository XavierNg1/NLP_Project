 This is a very common way to avoid all forms of social interaction.As long as you’re in an environment where cell phones are allowed, you can take out your phone and pretend to get an important call or text message. Excuse yourself from the situation and pretend to be deeply engaged in conversation.
 This may be used right after you pretend to receive an important phone call. Go back into the room, state that you just got an important call, and say you have to leave. Remember to make your excuse believable and relatively unverifiable.If you have children, try saying, “My son isn’t feeling well. I have to go pick him up.”
If you are on a date, try to look disappointed and say, “My roommate looked herself out, and I have to go let her in. Let’s meet up later.”

, This can be hard to pull off if the bathroom is within eyesight. If not, however, going to the bathroom may be your best escape route. No one will question this need, and they probably won’t go looking for you until at least five minutes have gone by.


A short trip to the bathroom may be all the time you need to get out of something. For example, if you’re in class and you don’t want to participate in an activity, ask your teacher to use the bathroom. Take your time so you miss the full activity.
You don’t always have to use the bathroom as an excuse for leaving. You can say that you’re going to get more popcorn from the concession stand, drinks, or anything you might need in the moment.That way, you have a real reason to take your coat and bag with you.

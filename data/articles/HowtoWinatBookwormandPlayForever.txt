 Those evil red 'fire' tiles are the death to this game; if any hit the bottom row it's game over. The key to stopping them is to build a "firewall". A firewall is three to four rows of colored tiles (green, yellow, sapphire and diamond) that slow down the burning red tiles and gives you time to make a word. As you start the game, make words that move the colored tiles to the bottom. Don't just choose any letter, pick useful ones like vowels and common consonants. Keep doing this until the bottom row is full of colored tiles. Continue until you have at least four rows of colored tiles. Keep this as your prime objective and don't get side tracked with making bonus words and words in the library-that can be done later. Longer words are better but your main goal is to first build a strong defense, even if it means using short words.;
, The key is to now play the game above the wall, using the colored tiles only when needed.

 Combine the eggs, tequila, chilies, and salt in a small bowl.;
, Heat the butter in a small frying pan over a medium setting. Scramble the eggs, stirring until they appear almost, but not quite, dry. They should still glisten with a bit of moisture but will continue to cook from their internal heat.
 Transfer the eggs on a serving plate and garnish with salsa, or wrap in a warm flour tortilla for a delicious burrito.

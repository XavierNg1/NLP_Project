 One reason people don’t like eating salads is because they don’t like the taste. Perhaps you hate iceberg lettuce, carrots, or tomatoes. If that’s so, don’t put them in your salad. Instead, include ingredients you enjoy eating.For example, if you like kale, green beans, steak, avocado, and feta cheese, toss all of them together in a salad.
 Combine different ingredients in the salad to get varied textures. You want a bit of crunchiness, crispiness, chewiness, and softness. These differences can help keep your salad interesting and satisfied.You can get crunch by adding roasted nuts and seeds, croutons, or pita chips. Crispy textures can be from sliced radishes, raw peppers, or apple. Chunks of meat and dried fruit can provide a chewy texture, while avocado or egg can be soft.
 Salads can be easier to eat when you cut the pieces very small so you don’t have huge chunks of vegetables that are awkward to eat. Cutting the ingredients very small also helps the ingredients mix together so the flavors can meld.For example, large chunks of carrot are awkward to place on forks; however, shredded carrots can be easier to eat and incorporate into the overall salad.
 Consider keeping your dressing in a separate container until you are ready to eat the dressing. If you mix your salad with dressing in the morning, your salad may be soggy and limp by lunch time. Instead, toss the salad lightly with dressing right before you are ready to eat it.
 Another way to feel personal satisfaction from your salad is to grow the ingredients yourself. You can grow lettuce or kale, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and other ingredients in your backyard garden. Your salad may taste better when you put the time and work into growing the ingredients yourself.

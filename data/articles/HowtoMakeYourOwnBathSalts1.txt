 Although every bath salt base requires at least epsom salts, you can choose to add other salt mixtures to give different appearances and benefits. Sea salt can be added for a finer grain, and pink Himalayan salt could be used to increase the mineral content of your bath salt mixture.;
, Although you can create a scent-less bath salt mixture, adding essential oils creates a lovely perfumed atmosphere when you take your baths. Choose floral, fruity, or woody scents to set the right mood for your best relaxation.


Popular floral scents include lavender, rose, and lilac. These all help to ease stress and aren’t too heavy, offering a light airy feel to your bath.
Stronger scents include eucalyptus, citrus, and peppermint. These help to invigorate your senses and focus your mind.
Mix multiple scents to create your own unique smells. Only add a few drops of each scent to keep the ultimate perfume levels proportional.
 You can choose to add dried herbs or flowers for added looks and scents to your bath salts. Try adding rosemary, thyme, or peppermint leaves that have been coarsely ground. Or, use dried rose or lavender petals. Leave these whole or grind them in a food processor before adding to your salts.
 It isn’t necessary to add color to your salts, but to make them look professional you can add a few drops of food coloring. Choose colors that match your scents, such as purple for lavender, or green for eucalyptus.

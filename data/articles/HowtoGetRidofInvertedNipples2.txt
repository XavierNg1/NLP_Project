 Place both thumbs on opposite sides of the nipple at the base. Gently pull the thumbs away from each other in opposite directions. Work both up and down and sideways.


Start with two repetitions per day, gradually building up to five.
This technique is thought to break down the adhesions at the base of the nipple that keep it inverted., Rolling, pulling, and sucking the nipple can all help encourage nipple protrusion. Don't force anything to the point of pain, though â€“ remember: firm, but gentle., Pull on the nipple gently when it is erect to encourage it to stay so. Afterward, wet a towel with cold water and apply it to your nipples to stimulate them further.

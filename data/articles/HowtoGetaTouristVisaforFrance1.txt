 Depending upon your home country you may or may not need a tourist visa for a 3-month or long-term stay.


If your native country is Andorra, Monaco or Switzerland, or it is part of the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA), then you do not need a tourist visa to France for any length of time.
You will not need a 3-month tourist visa, if you hold a passport from 1 of the following countries: United Kingdom, Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Bermuda, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Holy See, Honduras, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, Nicaragua, New Zealand, Panama, Paraguay, San Marino, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, or the Special Administrative Region of Macao of the People's Republic of China.
If your country is not listed, then you will most likely need to apply for a 3-month Schengen visa to visit France. Countries that require a Schengen visa include South Africa, India, Algeria, Philippines, Ukraine, China, Thailand, Russia, Zimbabwe and Pakistan. The Schengen visa is based on an agreement between 25 European countries that allows tourists to enter 1 of the 25 countries and go between other Schengen countries without showing their passport.;
, For most people, 3 months is plenty of time. If a 3-month visa is not waived for your nationality, then apply for a Schengen visa.


If you need to stay longer than 3 months, apply for a long-term stay visa. This is required for any nationality outside of the EU and EEA. Most often, the applicants for long-stay visas are applying to work, study or attend a family reunion.

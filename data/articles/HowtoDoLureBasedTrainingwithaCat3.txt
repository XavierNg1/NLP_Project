 Toys can also be a good lure that doesn’t put your cat in danger of obesity. If you are trying to use a toy as a lure, find one that your cat particularly likes, and don’t give the toy to it unless it successfully completes the trick. If the toy is always available, it will make it a less effective lure.
 To teach your cat to perform the trick without a treat—what is called “fading the lure”—begin by using your call and/or hand signal to ask your cat to repeat the trick even after the treat is gone. You can try to begin by asking your cat to perform the trick multiple times, only giving a treat after successfully completing a string of tricks., Perform the hand signal and the call without showing a treat. On the first few occasions, you might want to give your cat a treat anyway. This way, it will learn that even if they don’t see a treat, they might still get rewarded. Always provide verbal encouragement and/or use a clicker as positive reinforcement., Once your cat has successfully responded to a call without the lure on a couple of occasions, do one trick without offering a treat at all. Then, offer the treat the next couple of times that your cat does the trick, but, after that, go a little bit longer without offering a treat. Over a few months, slowly transition from giving your cat a treat nine out of ten times that it completes the task, to only one out of every ten times.

 You can use any bikini top with your new mermaid tail. This can be either a bikini you already own or you can buy one just for the occasion. Stores like Victoria’s Secret and Macy’s often sell bikini tops separately. The color should be chosen to match or complement the tail you have made, in order to give it a natural appearance.
 You can buy or make a shell top. These are easily made by glueing large craft shells to a bikini top. The shells can be painted or left to look natural. If you plan on swimming in this top you will want to use water-resistant glue. You can make a top from just shells and string by drilling holes into the shell but this is uncomfortable and it is easy to break the shell.
 You can use leftover fabric from making your tail to create a top which matches exactly. Many patterns and instructions are available for free online. The style will depend on your needs, personal preference and skill level.

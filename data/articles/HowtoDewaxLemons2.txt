 Arrange the lemons on a microwavable plate or in a microwavable dish. Keep them in an even, single layer.

Work with only a few lemons at a time for best results.
Do not stack the lemons on the plate. Stacking them can result in uneven heating, which may make it difficult to fully strip away the wax.
 Run the microwave on high for 10 to 20 seconds, depending on how many lemons you are working with.


If you are only working with one or two lemons, only microwave them for 10 seconds. If you are working with three to six lemons, increase the amount of time to 20 seconds.
The heat helps melt the wax. The softened wax will be easier to remove from the peel.
 Using a vegetable brush, lightly scrub the peel of each lemon while holding it under cool, running water.


It's best to scrub the lemons one at a time.
Cool to cold water is ideal since it can cool down the lemon peels after they were heated in the microwave.
Do not use a vegetable brush previously used with soapy water.
 Stop scrubbing and rinse each lemon one last time under the running water.


You can use your fingers to lightly scrub the peel during this step, but do not use the vegetable brush.
 After washing each lemon, pat it dry with clean paper towels.


The lemons can also be air dried on the kitchen counter, but do not store them while they remain wet.

 VPN services offer servers that you can connect to which you then process your network traffic. You connect directly to the VPN and all data is automatically encrypted, meaning your network only sees an encrypted connection to the VPN, not any of the sites you visit while connected.


You'll need to be able to setup the VPN connection on your computer or mobile device in order to connect to it. This is fine for your own laptop or phone, but may be difficult or impossible on a computer that you don't own.
You'll want to pick a reputable VPN service, as you are trusting them with your data. There are free VPN services, but as with any free service if you aren't paying for the product you are the product.
 The process for this varies depending on the operating system and type of device you are using. You likely won't be able to do this on any device that you do not own, as these functions are typically locked down.

Connecting to a VPN affects all of the internet traffic on your device, including chat programs and video games.
 Once you are connected, you can open your web browser and browse to Facebook. Since you're connecting to a VPN, it may take a little longer than normal to load websites.


As long as you trust your VPN provider, you can log into Facebook without having to worry about your account being compromised.

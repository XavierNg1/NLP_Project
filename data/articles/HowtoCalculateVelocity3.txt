 Circular velocity refers to the velocity that one object must travel in order to maintain its circular orbit around another object, usually a planet or other gravitating mass.The circular velocity of an object is calculated by dividing the circumference of the circular path by the time period over which the object travels.

When written as a formula, the equation is:

v = (2πr) / T



Note that 2πr equals the circumference of the circular path.


r stands for "radius"


T stands for "time period"


, The first stage of the problem is calculating the circumference. To do this, multiply the radius by 2π. If you are calculating this by hand, you can use 3.14 as an approximation for π.

Example: Find the circular velocity of an object traveling a circular path with a radius of 8 m over a full time interval of 45 seconds.

r = 8 m

T = 45 s

Circumference = 2πr = ~ (2)(3.14)(8 m) = 50.24 m




, In order to find the circular velocity of the object in question, you need to divide the calculated circumference by the time period over which the object traveled.

Example: v = (2πr) / T = 50.24 m / 45 s = 1.12 m/s

The circular velocity of the object is 1.12 m/s.

 If you have a friend who is skilled at taking portraits, ask if they would be willing to be your photographer. It’s a good idea to pay them some money for their work and their time, but you might be able to negotiate a lower fee.
 Give a shot list to the photographer to make sure they get all the photos you want in a short amount of time.You don’t have to hire a photographer for the entire wedding. Hire one for the ceremony and part of the reception to capture the essence of the event.
 Don’t ask for prints of your photos from the photographer. This is a “shoot only” package, where the photographer will just take pictures and give you either proofs or a CD of the images.
 Give disposable cameras to the guests and have them take pictures during the reception. This strategy often gives you a really unique perspective on your wedding, as you will get a nice array of photos that feature all of your guests, not just a handful that a photographer might focus on.

 Let them know how you’re doing and ask how they've been. Make an effort to write letters to members of your family that don’t have access to a computer or cell phone.


In your letter, ask your family member questions and encourage them to write back. Developing a handwritten correspondence with someone is a great way to bond, and taking the time to write out a letter each week shows that you care.
 They’ll appreciate the extra effort you took to send them something in the mail. If you have any prints of photos you want them to have, make copies and put them in the card before you send it out.


Make a holiday card where the front is a photo of you with your spouse, kids, pets, etc. You can hire a professional photographer and use fun props to capture a memorable photo to use. Make your holiday card a tradition and send one out every year.
 Send some food to your nephew starting college or package up a few goodies for your brother who just had surgery. You’ll likely get a call from them after they receive their package.


Include a traveling scrapbook in the package you send. Put some photos of your life in it and leave the rest of the pages blank. Have your family member add their own photos to the scrapbook and then pass it on to the next family member. Once it's full, you'll have a family scrapbook to look through when you're missing home.

 The beautiful thing about technology making mistakes is that we can use this as a very believable excuse, even if it's not true.Try this common problem: “I lost/dropped my phone and lost all of my contacts. Text me your number so I have it?”
For an excuse that works anywhere and anytime try, “I can’t find my phone! Will you call it for me so I know I didn’t lose it?”
If you have an opportunity to catch a cool photo together, you can even say, “My phone is out of space, can I use yours and send it to myself?” This is also a good way to get his Instagram handle.
 School is the easiest and most believable excuse to get a boy’s number if you have classes together.


Ask him if he can help you with your homework sometime.

DO NOT pretend you’re bad in a subject in the style of Cady Heron from Mean Girls, just to have an excuse to talk to a guy. If he’s the one who could use some help say, “Maybe we could study together sometime.”


If you're both working on a group project or other assignment, you can use this excuse to ask him for his number for a simple reason like, "so I can text you if I have a question."

, This is going to put him on the spot, while also showing your care-free and independent side.“A few of us are getting together this weekend to see a movie. Text me if you’re interested. Gotta go!”
This should prompt him to say, “Wait, I don’t have your number!” If he doesn’t think of that fast enough, he’ll find a way to get your number. If he doesn’t find a way, you’re better off without him.

 One slightly odd-sounding treatment is to cover your face with avocado. As with all homemade remedies, its effectiveness is questionable. Avocados do, however, have plenty of antioxidants and moisturising qualities. If you decide to try this get an organic avocado so it is free from any pesticides or other chemicals., Now scoop out the avocado flesh from the skin and drop into a small bowl. Mash it up with a fork so it becomes smooth and like a paste. You can add a few drops of water to help the process along.


You can also add a few drops of lemon juice to add extra kick to your avocado mask.
Remember if you have dry or sensitive skin lemon juice could make it worse.
 Once you have prepared your avocado, clean your face and hands before applying the paste to your skin. Leave it on for between 20 and 30 minutes, before rinsing it off with warm water and patting your face dry with a towel.

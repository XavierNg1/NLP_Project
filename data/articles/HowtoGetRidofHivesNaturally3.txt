 Heat itself can often cause a break of hives. Even if the heat did not cause your hives directly, it can still exacerbate the hives and increase the amount of discomfort that they cause.


If you are outdoors, go inside as soon as possible.
If you are engaging in physical activity, stop what you’re doing, sit down, and rest.
 Extra snug clothes—especially shirts and pants—will not only rub against your hives and cause them to itch more, but they’ll also be more likely to irritate your skin and cause hives in the first place.


Wear loose-fitting clothes.Wear lightweight clothing; this will prevent your skin from heating up.
 Aloe Vera can commonly be found in lotions and skin creams, and it will help relieve the itchy discomfort from your hives. The aloe will also reduce the inflammation of the hives themselves.


If you have access to an aloe plant, you can apply the leaves to your skin directly. To do this, cut the aloe leaf in half, then apply the clear gel directly onto the hives. Let it sit for about 30 minutes, then rinse with cold water., For most cases of hives, the temperature of cool bath water will relieve the symptoms of discomfort.The cool bath will also shrink the blood vessels near the surface of your skin. This will cause them to leak less fluid into the hives, and will consequently reduce the size of the hives.You can use bathing additives to relieve the itchy feeling of hives. Oatmeal is an especially effective bath additive; grind up 2 cups of oatmeal in your blender, and then add the ground oatmeal to your bath water.
Also try adding 2 cups of apple cider vinegar to your bath water., Sometimes dry skin itself will cause a breakout of hives—in this case moisturizing is preventative, as it can help prevent hives before they occur.


Even if you already have a case of hives, applying lotion or another moisturizer can help reduce the discomfort caused by itching.
To keep your skin moist, avoid excessively hot showers, and use a mild soap.

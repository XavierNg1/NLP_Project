 Your first impulse might be to say, "I need them all." However, you'd be surprised how much energy you can save by reducing your use of appliances, and how much satisfaction comes from being self-reliant.Consider changing your habits regarding the following energy-sapping appliances:


The dryer. If you have access to outside space, hang a clothesline and start drying your clothes outside. You can also get a drying rack to use indoors - just place it in your bedroom or bathroom near a window. If you must continue using the dryer, reduce your usage to once a week or so, rather than throwing in small loads every other day.
The dishwasher. Make sure each load you do is completely full. If you have time to wash dishes by hand using the water conservation method, that's even better.
The oven. Heating an electric oven requires a lot of energy. Plan to do all of your baking on one day of the week, while the oven is hot, instead of heating it every few days for various purposes.
The vacuum. Sweep whenever you can instead of using a vacuum. Even a carpet can be swept between vacuuming sessions to remove larger pieces of debris.
 Make a habit of unplugging everything that's not in use, especially computers, TVs and sound systems, which use up the most energy.


Don't forget small appliances like coffee makers, hair dryers and phone chargers.
Determine whether it's really necessary to keep plug-in air fresheners and night lights.
 Older appliances weren't always designed with energy conservation in mind. If you have an older refrigerator, dishwasher, oven, or dryer, you may be using more energy (and paying more money) than strictly necessary for the chores you need to do. Conduct research to find newer models that are more energy efficient.

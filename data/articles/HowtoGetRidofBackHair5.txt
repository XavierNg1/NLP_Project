 Taking a quick bath or shower softens you back hairs and relaxes your skin. This can make it a lot easier to remove the hair, so while it's not essential, it's usually a wise idea.


You don't need to wash with soap yet — this will come later.

Note: As with waxing, it's best to do this method the day before you need to show off your back so any redness and irritation will have a chance to subside.
 Most epilators work better on dry skin.Some, however, are designed to be used in wet environments — check the packaging if you are unsure.


Optionally, you can apply some talc or baby powder after drying off with a towel. This will further dry the hair in addition to getting it to stand up, making epilation easier., Turn the epilator on. Get an assistant to drag it slowly across the patches of hair on your back. The teeth of the epilator will pull the hairs out (similar to how a waxing strip would). This is generally described as being painful, though there is some debate about whether waxing or epilating hurts more. As when waxing, don't hesitate to take breaks.


If the pain is too intense, dragging the epilator across the skin more quickly can reduce the amount of time you have to endure the pain. However, you may need to go back over the same patch multiple times if you miss hairs.
 When you're done, your back will likely be red and irritated. To help prevent infection, wash gently with soap and warm water. Pat dry with a clean towel when done.

 (The placket is the strip of fabric that you button through).All three should be sandwiched together in the clip.









Make sure the tie is actually clipped to your shirt. The purpose of the tie clip is to keep your tie securely in place, so if you just slide the tie through the clip and don't anchor it to anything, your tie will still flap freely and get in your way.
 Placement is the other "rule" of wearing a tie clipâ€”too high makes the tie clip useless (your tie will still flop around or fall in your soup when you lean forward), too low looks awkward or hides the clip behind your jacket.When adjusting the tie clip, make sure that it is un-clipped, so as not to stretch and damage the material of the tie and the dress shirt.
Check that the tie clip is perpendicular to your tie. It should always be straight across, not angled up or down.If necessary, adjust your tie so that it lies flat against your shirt with no bunching or puckering.
 Take the top half of your tie and pull it up slightly, so that it's not pulled tight against your chest. It should puff up and forward slightly. This adds some depth and personality to your look, and may make the tie feel less constricting.

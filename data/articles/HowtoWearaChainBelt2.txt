 If the pants, skirt, dress or jumpsuit you are wearing has built in belt loops, then threading the belt through the loops may be the best way to wear a chain belt with this garment. Thread the chain belt through the loops and secure it in front or slightly off to the side.If you are concerned about the belt loops hiding the chain belt, then just thread it through every other belt loop or even just the two loops on the side of your pants, skirt, dress, or jumpsuit.
 Chain belts emphasize the area that they cover, so wearing a chain belt low on your hips can emphasize the curves of your body. If you want to make your hips seem wider or simply draw attention to them, then position a chain belt around your hips.


Be sure to cinch the belt tight enough so that it will stay on your hips, but not so tight that it will cause discomfort or create a muffin-top effect.
 Belts of all kinds are great for defining your natural waistline. You can wear a chain belt around your natural waistline to define your figure and emphasize your waist.Your natural waistline is the smallest area of your waist, usually around your belly button or slightly above it.

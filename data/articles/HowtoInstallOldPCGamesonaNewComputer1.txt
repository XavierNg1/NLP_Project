 Most Operating Systems (OSs) won't be able to run DOS games, but you can bypass this obstacle by making use of a DOS emulator. One highly recommended emulator by users is DOSBox, a free emulator you can find with a quick Internet search.Download and install DOSBox on your computer.;
, This will require some searching on your part, but the DOSBox.com forum might connect you to the game you're looking for sooner than a general online search. After you find the game, download it to your computer.
 In many cases, the DOS game software you download will be bundled with installation instructions. For best results, you should follow all included directions.
 It is recommended that you can make a new folder directly to your hard drive (usually prefixed by "C:" or "D:") to make mounting these files to a virtual hard drive easier. Move the DOS game(s) you downloaded to this folder in preparation for mounting these files in DOSBox. Some recommended names for your DOS games folder are:


DOSGames
DOS

, Open DOSBox and through the text interface, type in the command "mount c C:\DOSBox". This will mount DOSBox's virtual drive, which you will use to install your game.
 The file path for the right installation program for your game will vary depending on which game you have downloaded. In principle, you will type the approximate command: "mount d C:\DOSGames\Installfolder - cdrom", but you will have to follow the individual instructions outlining the correct file path for installation. These should have been included with your downloaded DOS game.

 Sprinkling the chemicals directly on the fire typically works best on campfires. Allow your fire to burn until there is a bed of red embers beneath it and the flames have died down a bit.For the best results, the flames should be approximately 1 foot (30 cm) high.
 Start with just a pinch to test the chemical and ensure that no adverse reactions occur. Be sure to stand back a bit as you add the powder to the fire to protect yourself.Wear safety glasses and fire-resistant gloves when you add the chemicals to the fire.
 The first sprinkle of the chemical will likely not change the flamesâ€™ color, so you should keep adding more until you notice a change. In many cases, it can take up to a minute for the color change to be visible.

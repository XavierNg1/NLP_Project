 The hem on a curtain lining should be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) narrower than the hem on the curtain. For example, if your curtain has a 4 inch (10.16 centimeters) wide hem, the hem on the lining should be 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) wide.You'll need to cut your lining 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) longer than you want it to be.


Curtain linings are about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) shorter than the curtain. Plan accordingly., Curtain linings are usually tucked into the side hem. If you are hemming a store-bought curtain, this could be a problem, depending on how short you are cutting and hemming your curtain. Use a seam ripper to undo the bottom portion of each side hem, and trim the lining down to the length you need. You will tuck it back into the side hems later.
 How much you fold it up will depend on how wide you want the hem to be. For example, if your hem to be 3 inches (7.62 centimeters), fold it up by 3 inches (7.62 centimeters). If necessary, use sewing pins to hold the hem in place. Be sure to remove the pins once you are done ironing.


Make sure that you are folding the hem inside the curtain. You do not want the hem to be visible from the outside.
The bottom edge of the lining should rest 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above the bottom edge of the curtain when you are done. The bottom edges of the curtain and the lining should not be aligned.
 Cut a piece of hem tape slightly shorter than the width of your lining. Tuck it inside the hem, aligning the top edge with the top of the folded hem. Iron the hem down.
 Try to sew as close to the top folded edge as you can. Use a color that matches the lining color as closely as possible.
 Be sure to tuck the lining into hem before you sew it down. Using hem tape for this would not be a good idea, especially if the rest of the side hem is sewn. You can sew it either by hand or on a sewing machine. Try to match the original thread color and stitch length as best as you can.

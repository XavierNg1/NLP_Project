 Place 4 1/3 cups of sugar, 2 cups of water, 1 tsp. of vinegar, 1/2 cup of corn syrup and 1 drop of food coloring in the pan. Stir them together very gently so you don't end up forming any sugar crystals on the side of the pan., Use a candy thermometer and watch it closely until it reaches 268째F (131째C). Then, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool until it gets down to 212째F (100째C).
, Do this by squeezing it gently while you carefully turn the container.
 The baking sheet should have sides.
 Rub off any excess that you see.
 Make a hole in the center of the candy. Use your thumb and forefingers to burrow a hole in the center of the candy. Then, use pressure to make the circle bigger, while the candy remains the same thickness around the rope you've made. Once the rope is long enough, twist it into a figure eight and bring both of the halves together.
 Hold the candy in both fists. Keep your front hand stable while your back hand pulls back gently. Rotate your hands around the candy and keep on pulling until the strands are nice and long. Keep pulling the candy at least 10-14 times.
 Enjoy this yummy pulled candy while it's in good shape.

 For example, if you want to know whether 10,516 is divisible by 11, write the number like this:1     0     5     1     6;
, For example:+1     0     5     1     6

, Your paper should now look like this:+1   -  0     5     1     6

, Add a + sign in front of the third digit, then a - sign in front of the fourth, and so on until you reach the end:+1   -  0   +  5   -  1   +  6

, Now treat this like any arithmetic problem, adding and subtracting the digits together:
+1   -  0   +  5   -  1   +  6= 11


, These simple rules tell you whether the original number is divisible by 11:


If your answer is divisible by 11 (0, 11, 22, etc.), the original number is also divisible by 11. Keep in mind that 0 is a multiple of 11, since 11 * 0 = 0.
If your answer is not a multiple of 11, the original number is not divisible by 11.

The answer was 11, which is a multiple of 11.
Therefore, the original number 10,516 is divisible by 11.
 Here are a couple practice problems. Try to solve them on your own, then check the answers below.Use the alternate sums method on each number to check whether it's divisible by 11:
A. 10,032
B. 142
C. 8,470,803

, Here are the answers to the practice problems:
A. 10032
+1 - 0 + 0 - 3 + 2 = 0
0 is divisible by 11, so yes, 10,032 is also divisible by 11.B. 142
+1 - 4 + 2 = -1.
-1 is not divisible by 11, so no, 142 is not divisible by 11.C. 8470803
+8 - 4 + 7 - 0 + 8 - 0 + 3 = 22
22 is divisible by 11, since 11 * 2 = 22. Yes, 8,470,803 is divisible by 11.

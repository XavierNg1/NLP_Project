 A second coat of chalk paint is not usually necessary, but it can help cover imperfections. It can also give you a two-tone look if you use a lighter shade or the same shade for the second layer. The bottom layer of paint will show through slightly, altering the color., Chalk paint dries relatively quickly, but if possible give it about two hours to dry totally., If you like the matte look of the dried chalk paint, keep it as is. For a more distressed look, use a medium-grit sandpaper and gently rub the surface, especially at the edges., You can use clear or tinted wax. Gently massage wax into surface of the piece you painted with a soft wax brush. You should use a 500-mL tin of wax for every 3 to 4 liters of paint you used. Work the wax in with the grain of the wood. Let the wax cure for at least 30 minutes., You can do this with a soft, clean cloth. Rub the cured wax surface in small, even circles until the surface shines., Once the wax is buffed, you can replace any hardware you removed to paint the piece. Be careful not to overtighten any screws, as this can scrape your paint up.

 More and more gyms are offering pole dancing classes as a creative way to get fit. Call yours to see if they offer one. You can also find out if fitness center chains that are known to offer pole dancing classes are in your area. Many independent teachers offer pole dancing classes in local gyms and halls too, so it's worth checking to see if anyone offers lessons near you. If you can't find anyone to teach you this challenging activity, then you can even buy a pole to install at home.


If you want to pole dance in the comforts of your own home, then you should get a free-standing pole that you can install in your home after carefully following the instructions. The pole should be completely fitted to your ceiling and floor and should be secured in a place that gives you lots of space to move around.;
, As you prepare to pole dance, you should wear comfortable clothes that expose your arms and legs. Sexiness is optional. Baring your skin will allow you to get a much better grip on the pole with your arms and legs so that you can perform these moves safely. For even better foot grips, try going barefoot. You can wear heels if you're comfortable with the pole and want to feel sexy, or some trainers to get a good drip on the pole.
 Avoid putting any oils or lotions on your body before you begin to pole dance. This will make you slide from the pole and can even be dangerous. You can even wipe down the pole before you use it to get rid of any oils or grease.
 Just as you would before any other form of exercise, you should do some light stretching and warming up before you begin to pole dance. Stand straight and then bend down to touch your toes, roll your neck and shoulders, and stretch your hamstrings by pulling one foot back with your toes touching your butt until you feel a nice stretch on each hamstring.


Pull back your fingers with your palms facing away from you to stretch your wrists. Your fingers and wrists will need to be warmed up to grip the pole.

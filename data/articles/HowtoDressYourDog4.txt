 The earlier you start clothing your dog the better they will adjust to wearing apparel. Whether you’d like them to get used to wearing costumes or being short-haired and needing warm clothing in a cold environment, starting when they are a puppy will help them acclimate. Be sure to start simply, especially if they are puppies, as you don’t want them to choke or harm themselves on elaborate costumes.Try starting with small collar modifications or a simple cape.
 Some dogs have a laid-back demeanor and will have no problem being dressed up while others might be scared or aggressive. Know that it may take time for your dog to warm up to the idea of getting dressed up, even if they need the apparel to stay warm or go on a long hike. Instead of trying to force your dog into clothing right away, start by placing the item near them on the ground and let them sniff it to become familiar. Be patient and don't force your dog into any apparel they are resistant to wear.


The more exposure your dog has to their apparel the more likely they will be to warm to it.
 Treat your dog anytime they make progress with approaching or wearing apparel, no matter the type. A small dog treat will help retrain them, even if your dog is displaying anxious behavior when you place clothing down on the floor. Giving your dog treats can also be an effective way of distracting your dog when you need to remove their apparel.

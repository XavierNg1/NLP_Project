 Find an ADA-approved gel to use on your teeth and read the instructions to understand the process of using a whitening gel. Then, brush the gel onto your teeth with a small brush, just as you normally would -- for at least two minutes. Then, spit out the remaining gel and rinse out your mouth until the gel is gone.


Whitening gels do not use a strong bleaching agent, so sensitivity is unlikely.
Continue using the whitening gel twice a day for fourteen days, or for however long the product is recommended on the instructions. You'll see results in just a few days.
 Make sure the toothpaste is ADA approved before you purchase it. ADA approved whitening toothpastes whiten your teeth by gently removing their surface stains through polishing, chemical chelation, or other processes that do not require bleach. You can find many of these toothpastes over the counter. Use the toothpaste just as you would use any other toothpaste, brushing your teeth for at least two minutes and then rinsing your mouth.

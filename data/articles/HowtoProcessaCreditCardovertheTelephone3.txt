 A merchant account is a bank account used to receive funds from credit card and debit card sales. These accounts are set up with banks, who process the transactions and deposit the transaction balances, minus their fee, into the bank account of the vendor (the seller who accepted the credit card purchase). This is the traditional way for vendors to accept credit cards. It is cheaper than mobile processors, which involve an additional middleman, the aggregator. However, it also requires that a business have a certain credit history and sales volume. If your business meets this criteria, consider the following options for using a merchant account., A credit card terminal is the most common and in many cases the most cost effective way of accepting credit cards. These devices allow you to swipe a card, enter the transaction amount, and then finalize the transaction on the spot. They transmit information safely and effectively to your merchant bank and can also be used to provide your customer with a receipt.


Terminals can be obtained from your merchant bank for a fee, which is usually a few hundred dollars.
Terminals require connectivity to process, usually a telephone line.
 If you don't have access to an internet connection, but still need to process credit cards, you can use the old-fashioned method of accepting credit cards: an imprinter. This device creates a carbon copy of the credit card that you can then use the process the transaction later via one of the other methods, such as visiting a bank or entering them into a terminal. The downside is that you assume risk by carrying around copies of your customers' credit cards.


You can usually get an imprinter cheaply or for free from the bank where you got your merchant account.

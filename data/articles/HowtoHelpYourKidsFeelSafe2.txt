 One way that you can help your kids feel safe is by letting them know that you are prepared for unexpected situations. Keep emergency supplies on hand and make sure everyone (adults and kids) know where they are and how to use them.For instance, you might show your kids where you keep the first aid kit at home and in your vehicle.
Make sure you all know where flashlights, blankets, water, and other emergency supplies are kept.
Keep prescriptions in a place that you can locate and transport them quickly if needed. For example, you might keep a cooler on top of the refrigerator to transport insulin in an emergency.
 In some cases you may need to evacuate your home in a hurry. You can make this a quick, safe process and keep your kids calm if you already have ‘go-bags’ packed and kept somewhere with easy access.Pack a bag containing a set of clothing and toiletries for each person.
Include items like batteries, non-perishable food, medications, copies of important documents, and even a small memento in your ‘go-bags’ to help calm your kids.
 If your kids know who to contact in a scary situation and how to contact them can help them feel safe. Work with your kids to create a list of people or organizations they can contact when they don’t feel safe.


For example, you might include your work and cell number on the list, along with your email address.
Or, for example, you may put family friends, community members, or other trusted adults on the list.

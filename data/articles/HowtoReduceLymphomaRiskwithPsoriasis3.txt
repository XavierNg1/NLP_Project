 In some cases, radiation is given as a treatment for localized cases of HL that have not spread systemically throughout the body (i.e. where only one or a few lymph nodes appear to be affected, but the cancer is not widespread). Radiation may be given alone, or in combination with chemotherapy.


A stem cell transplant may be considered as a form of treatment in severe cases of HL, or in recurrent cases that are unresponsive to initial treatment.
 These range from topical treatments applied directly to the skin lesion(s), to phototherapy for the affected area, to localized radiation, to full-body chemotherapy, among other things.


The best treatment for you, if you are in fact diagnosed with CTCL, will depend upon the extent of the cancer (and whether it is localized to a single skin lesion, or whether it has begun to spread throughout your body).
 Depending upon the type of cancer treatment you receive for your lymphoma, you may need to temporarily stop (or reduce) your psoriasis treatments; however, if they are stopped (for instance, during an intense period of chemotherapy), you will most likely be able to resume them following completion of the treatment.

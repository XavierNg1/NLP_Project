 You can use plain white paper (or card if you prefer) which you can later decorate with your flag's colors using crayons, pencils, markers or paint. Alternatively, you can use paper that's the same color as the base color of your flag. For example, if you were making a British flag, you could use blue paper, or if you're making a Canadian flag, you could use red paper.;
, This will form the flagpole. Make sure to roll the sheets of paper tightly, using sticky tape to secure. If you don't want to use paper, you can use a thin wooden stick as your flagpole.
 Take the two rolled sheets of paper and slot the ends into each other to make one long tube. Secure with some sticky tape.
 Lay the four sheets of paper out flat on the table and align them so that they form a rectangle. Use paper masking tape (which you can later color over) to stick the four sheets of paper together. Tape on both sides of the paper for extra strength.
 Use regular sticky tape to attach the paper rectangle to the tube. Make sure that it's attached securely so it won't fall apart when you wave it.
 Now you can decorate your flag with the colors of whatever country or team colors you like. Use your favorite coloring materials or paints, add stickers or glitter, or write slogans on one or both sides of your flag. You can also cut shapes, such as stars or moons out from extra pieces of colored paper and glue these to your flag.

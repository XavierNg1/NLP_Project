 Make sure you also have all your supplies handy and ready when making this scarf.



Fold the left and right corners to the center edge. Attach with a small stitch. You can do this using either your sewing machine, or by hand.
Optional: If your scarf is short enough, you may sew buttons (or snaps or clasps) to the little flaps in the front. You can also “bling” out the scarf/vest by adding a few studs or faux jewels––whatever will make the scarf/vest extra special.

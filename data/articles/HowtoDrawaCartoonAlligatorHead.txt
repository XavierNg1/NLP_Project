 Those will be your gator's eyelids.;
, (Except the small one in between) Inside the ovals, draw in two small circles, and fill them in. You've just finished your alligators eyes!

, At the end of the line, make a tiny curve, and a little to the right, add another small curve. These are the alligator's nose. Now, make a line from the first part of the nose that you've made, and curve it around both nostrils and upwards, just like in the image above.
 That is your gator's smile! After that, make a line starting at the left of your gator's smile, and do the same as done with the smile, or the mouth.
 Then, start another line from your gator's chin, to the bottom of the paper. Finally, create little bumps or curves down your alligator's back to make his scales.
 Either way, you'll still have an amazing cartoon alligator to show your family and friends!Â

 When others are jealous, it’s easy to start questioning yourself, but you worked for your accomplishments. Don’t allow their negativity to degrade your achievement.


If you win an award or position at school, you may experience jealousy from friends as well as your other classmates. When this happens, remember what motivated you to go for your goal in the first place and all of the work it took to get there.
Celebrate the effort that your opponents also put into working toward their goal because they may have put in the same amount of work that you did. Congratulate them for all that they did accomplish and encourage them to work alongside you moving forward.
 Since it’s easier to drag down others than it is to boost ourselves, jealous people often try to prevent you from achieving your goals so that they won’t feel bad about not meeting theirs. When this happens, take a step back and ask yourself what’s most important to you., While not everyone has the same goals, successful people share common traits, such as resiliency and persistence. Stay on track to continue your successes by forming friendships with other people who are goal-oriented.As a group, you can support each other.


Start a support group at your school.
Found a club to help you find other students who share your interests.
Volunteer to mentor other students.
 Create a visual reminder of your goals to keep you on track, even when you feel like others are against you. Whenever you feel like your classmates are getting jealous, you can look at your board and remember why you’re working so hard. Take a photo of your vision board so that you can look at it when you’re not at home.

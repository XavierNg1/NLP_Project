 Shy people sometimes feel more comfortable exploring social connections on the internet.The ability to self edit and manage impressions may increase his sense of control, thus reducing anxiety.Social networking sites allow shy people to explore relationships, without the pressure to immediately respond often inherent in face to face communication.
When the nature of the conversation is personal, be sure to private message him. He may be uncomfortable having sensitive, personal information available to all of his connections.
 This both breaks the ice online and provides a topic to help externalize. Being online provides the perfect opportunity to share videos, photos, games, or general knowledge.


Avoid beginning any conversation, even those online, with deeply personal information or questions. Even online, he may withdraw if he becomes too uncomfortable.
 Making yourself increasingly vulnerable will help him feel safe to do the same. Ask him to also share, if he doesn't open up on his own.


It is appropriate to ask for reciprocation, but it doesn't need to be measured by a standard definition of equal. Take his boundaries and limitations into consideration. What may be a minor disclosure to you may have taken him well outside his comfort zone.
Take your own vulnerabilities into account. If you don't think he's really going to reciprocate, you don't have to completely lay yourself bare.

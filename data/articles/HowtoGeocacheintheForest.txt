 Nothing is more depressing than trying to find a geocache in the pouring rain. Dirt automatically turns into mud, trees and branches are always dripping with water, and wet trails may be harder to walk on. Sunny days usually make people more happy and energized to hike and scout for caches.;
, Most forest and parks will have some kind of a parking area. If necessary, set a way point as soon as you leave your vehicle. Locate an information center or a forest kiosk and get a map if you're new to the area. You can always visit an official website and print a map from there as well.
 Loose comfortable clothing or anything you are willing to get dirty, wet, and possibly muddy. During the winter, be sure to dress warm enough to be out for at least 1-2 hours. Hiking boots are very recommended, as sneakers can easily be soaked while crossing streams, swamps, or climbing different types of terrain. The sturdier the sole is, the better. Always carry a portable or small bug or mosquito spray with you. Apply some on before heading into the forest.
 Some cache hiders will advise others to stick to the trails until the last 5 to 20 feet (1.5 to 6.1Â m) to find the cache. If there are no hints or advise, use your judgment depending on the latitude and longitude between where you stand and how far away the cache coordinates are. If you see another trail off the main one, try a "trial and error" by following the secondary trail to see if it helps.
 Use creativity to think of where the cache may be hidden or ask yourself if anything looks "out of place", as other items may be helping to cover it. Some caches may be hidden in logs or in trees.
 You've come out to find the cache, why not take a breath to enjoy the view? Take pictures of the wildlife, nature, or animals that you encounter on your trip.

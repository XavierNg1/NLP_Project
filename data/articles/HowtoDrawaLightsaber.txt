 This shows the basic length and position of the saber. Divide this line into unequal pieces (the lower section should be about one-sixth the size of the upper section).;
, The handle is comprised of several small pieces as seen here.
 So long as you keep the outer lines parallel to each other, it doesn't matter if the size of your saber digresses from what's here.
 Use a dark color for the handle. Leave the saber white, but color around it with a light neon color to give the impression of bright light.

 If you are unable or unwilling to care for your child immediately after their birth, you may be able to take your child to a safe haven drop-off spot. A safe haven drop-off spot is a location, designated by law, that you are able to drop off new born babies without the threat of legal action. In Georgia, the safe haven statute protects mothers who leave their children at designated safe haven locations in a designated manner.


However, a mother can be prosecuted if the child shows signs of neglect or abuse., In Georgia, an infant's mother can drop off her baby at a designated location so long as the baby is seven days old or younger. These laws are aimed at providing a service for new mothers who did not arrange for their child's care prior to giving birth. Once a baby reaches the age of eight days old, you will not be able to take advantage of the safe haven law., Unlike many other states that allow you to drop your infant off at police stations, fire stations, churches, and or medical centers, Georgia only allows mothers to drop their infants off at designated medical facilities.


Designated medical facilities include hospitals, institutional infirmaries, health centers, or birthing centers in the state of Georgia., When you find an appropriate location, take your infant and drop them off on location. You are required to leave your child in the physical custody of an employee, agent, or staff member of the medical facility. You cannot leave the child alone or simply drop them off at the front door., When you drop your infant off at a drop-off location, you will need to show proof of your identity if you have it available. In addition, you will have to provide your name and address to the person who takes custody of your child.

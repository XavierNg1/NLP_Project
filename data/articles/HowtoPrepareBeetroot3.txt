 Choose a heavy-duty baking foil. First, measure out a square of foil and crinkle it slightly. Next, wrap each cleaned and trimmed beet in a loose layer of aluminum foil. Make sure every part of the beetroot is covered.
 Preheat your oven to 375° F (190° C). Place the wrapped beets directly on the oven rack and cook them for about an hour. Let the beets cool before handling them.Test for doneness by piercing the tip with a paring knife. The knife should pierce the skin easily.
 First, make sure the beets have cooled. Next, dampen a clean dishcloth. Use this dishcloth to rub away the skin of the beet.After the beetroot is peeled, cut off and discard the top section attached to the stem and the long pointed tip.


The skin of the beetroot should slip off easily when cooked. If not, cook the beetroot for another ten minutes.
Remember to wear gloves while working with beets.
 Once the beets have been roasted and peeled, chop the beets into bite-sized pieces and place in a serving bowl. Drizzle in some olive oil and toss the beets with salt and pepper. Now you can add nuts, sliced vegetables, pieces of citrus fruit, or soft cheese. Wear gloves while peeling the beetroots to avoid staining your fingers. Serve as a delicious winter salad.


Baked beets, hazelnuts, blood orange, and goat cheese are a popular beet salad combination.
If you prefer savory combinations, try adding feta cheese and sliced red onions to baked beetroots.

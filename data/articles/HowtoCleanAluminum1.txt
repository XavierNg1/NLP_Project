 Trying to clean a hot pan can lead to burned fingers., Wash and dry utensils and pans to make sure they are free of any oil or dirt. Use warm water with dish-washing soap to remove the grease., Try a dish scrubber first.If that doesn't succeed, boil water in the bottom of the pan, then use a wooden spoon to scrape off the inside until you reach the aluminum., For each quart of water you need, use 2 tablespoons of cream of tartar, white vinegar, or lemon juice.The acidic solution reduces discoloration due to oxidation. You can also rub flatware down with acidic fruits or vegetables, such as apples or rhubarb. Alternatively, you can add apple peels to the water in place of the acid.If you prefer, you can use a gentle aluminum cleaner meant for cookware instead of the boiling method. Use it as you would any soap or mild abrasive to clean flatware and pots.Rub it on with a sponge, and then rinse it or wipe it off. You can also use cleaners like Bar Keeper's Friend., If you are cleaning flatware, add it to a pot and then add the solution.If you need to clean the outside of a pot as well as the inside, try submerging it in a larger pot. If you don't have a pot big enough to fit the pot you want to clean, try rubbing the outside with a cut lemon dipped in salt.
 Let it simmer for 10 to 15 minutes., Allow the pot and its contents to cool. Pour out the water.
 This process helps remove any leftover discoloration.


Avoid using steel wool. It can be too abrasive, causing you problems in the future., Using a clean towel, dry the pot thoroughly.

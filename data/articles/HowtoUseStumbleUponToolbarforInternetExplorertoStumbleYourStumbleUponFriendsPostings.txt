 Provide your login information to the dialog box that is displayed. Make sure the checkbox labeled "Sign-out when I close the browser" is not checked, as it will save you time later on, if you should ever want to submit other new links to their database with known URL's. For StumbleUpon, it's best to try to stay logged in all the time, so you can submit new sites that aren't in the StumbleUpon database just yet, on occasion.;
, Once you are logged in to the toolbar, you will see several buttons. One button in particular, advances you from page to page. This button is known as the "Stumble" button. Please take visual note of the location of this button now.

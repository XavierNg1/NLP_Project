 Since fast food restaurants are open all week, typically for many hours a day, employee work schedules are usually flexible.This industry is especially accommodating to employees who want extra hours, an opportunity that is not always available with a strict 9 to 5 schedule. Take advantage of the opportunity to work at different times of the day and request shifts outside of typical work day hours; this will allow you to avoid rush hour hassles, and possibly cut down the time of your commute., Working in the service industry provides you with an opportunity to meet people from all walks of life. You're likely learning how to read people, which is a valuable skill; additionally, the camaraderie and fun you may develop with your fellow employees doesn't exist in all working environments. Social interaction is a crucial part of human life and is thought to be a factor in extending lifespan.To bond with co-workers, try:


organizing after-work outings
sitting with them during your breaks
participating in team-building activities sponsored by the company (charity events, sports, etc.)starting discussions about workplace experiences (e.g. "I just served a really difficult customer. How do you deal with that kind of situation?")

, Most jobs are stationary - in other words, many people have desk jobs where they are required to sit for long periods of time. Sitting for too many consecutive hours on a regular basis can result in neck and back pain, an increased risk of heart disease, poor posture, and difficulty concentrating.To avoid getting overwhelmed by the fast pace of your fast food job, take advantage of your break time to regroup, relax, and focus on your breathing.Having a job that requires physical activity not only makes the time pass quickly, but it keeps your body active.


Make sure to take care of your feet; buy a pair of comfortable shoes and breathable socks to prevent injury and hygiene issues while you're on your feet for long periods of time.

 Shien is very similar to Soresu, in that it uses similar moves to deflect blaster bolts. The main difference with Shien, though, is that the blaster bolts are deflected in such a way that they either:

Return to, and hit, the person who fired them;
Hit another opponent; or
Damage the environment in such a way that is disadvantageous to your opponent (e.g. destroy an overhang and bury them under a pile of rubble)

, This makes it easier to perform large, sweeping moves, in the manner of throwing a punch. Some, however, frown on this style. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide.

 It boosts your fun levels to have a few. If you want, you could invite 5, but over 5 will get crazy.
 When they say something, like, "Princess tiger plushie is stolen by crocodile dragon", move the crocodile plushie so it looks as if it's 'carrying' the tiger away. You could also use pet castles as dollhouses.
 Pretend to watch super funny things like an old man being crushed by flying beluga whales! You can pretend to get snacks during 'commercials'.
 Play dress up by going into the epic wonders carriage, dressing like a princess, and coming out as royalty! You can also play with plushies again, and have giant plushies be the mom and dad, normal sized ones being children, and tiny summer carnival ones being infants!

, Then switch to your castle den and have dinner. You can have dinner be whatever anyone wants, hamburgers or hotdogs is up to you!

, If it's not, say your goodbyes and go to your bedroom. If it is, take your buddies to your bedroom and tell scary stories, make shadow puppets, and when your mom goes to sleep sneak up and watch TV!

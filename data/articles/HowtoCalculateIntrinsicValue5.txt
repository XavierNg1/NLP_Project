  The formula for the discounted cash flow method is: PV=CF1/(1+k)+CF2/(1+k)2{\displaystyle PV=CF_{1}/(1+k)+CF_{2}/(1+k)^{2}}…/(1+k)n−1{\displaystyle /(1+k)^{n-1}}.PV{\displaystyle PV} = present value

 CFi{\displaystyle CF_{i}} = cash flow in year i

 k{\displaystyle k} = discount rate

 TCF{\displaystyle TCF} = terminal year cash flow

 g{\displaystyle g} = growth rate assumption in perpetuity beyond terminal year

 n{\displaystyle n} = the number of years in the period including the terminal year.

 To understand the formula, you need to understand free cash flow, capital expenditures and weighted average cost of capital.
 Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Operating cash flow is the cash inflows and outflows from your day-to-day business. That includes buying inventory, making payroll and collecting cash from customers.A capital expenditure represents your spending on fixed assets, such as machinery and equipment. Think about the assets you will use in your business over a period of years.

 Successful companies are able to generate most of their cash from operations. If you manufacture and sell denim jeans, for example, selling jeans should be your primary sources of cash. 

 If you have free cash flow, you have the flexibility to spend cash on areas that can grow your sales and earnings. If a competitor’s business was up for sale, for example, a firm could use their free cash flow to buy the operation and expand the company.
 Capital represents money you raise to run your business. If you issue stock to investors, they will expect some rate of return on their equity investment. Bond investors want an interest rate paid on their bond investment.Issuing bonds (debt) and stock (equity) comes with a cost. We refer to that cost as the cost of capital.

 If the profit you expect to generate on a project is more than the cost of capital, it makes financial sense to raise capital for a project.

 The discounted cash flow method uses WACC in the formula.
  Consider the valuation of Sun Microsystems in 2012.  It was traded at $3.25.  But the long-term growth rate was estimated to be 13 percent.  This means the stock was valued at $5.50, making the $3.25 price a very good deal.Changes in the growth rate and interest rates have a huge impact on valuation.

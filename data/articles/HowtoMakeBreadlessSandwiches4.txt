 Place the leaf of lettuce so that the rib is horizontal. If you do not have a big enough leaf, you can always glue two pieces of butter lettuce together with some hummus. Simply place a thin layer of hummus on the edge of one piece of lettuce and then place the second piece of lettuce overtop and press down., Start by evenly spreading the hummus over the bottom third of the lettuce leaf. You want to spread it in an even layer, rather than just a big dollop. You should have a two inch border around the leaf., Place the tofu or cooked, sliced chicken breast in the middle of the wrap. Then, add the sprouts. Evenly distribute the za-atar overtop all of the ingredients. Then, roll up your wrap. Start by folding in the sides to the center. Then, roll it up horizontally, rolling it up away from you as if you were making a burrito. You can either enjoy it right away or wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate it. It will be good for twenty four hours.

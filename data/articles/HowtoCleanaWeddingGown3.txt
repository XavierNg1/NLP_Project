 Spread a clean sheet on the floor of your working area to protect the dress as you press it. It is best if you use a clean press cloth of white cotton sheeting or muslin unless you are using a brand new or freshly cleaned iron., Start at the back and bottom of the train until you feel comfortable with the pressing. Take your time and use caution. When it is finished you are ready to preserve your gown. We recommend that you first wash and dry your ironing board cover to remove any dirt, starch, or sizing.


Where possible, press the dress from the inside. If you have a thick, cushy, ironing board cover, the sequins and beads can press into it. Start at a low temperature, and increase it gradually. If it starts to stick, reduce the heat immediately.
 Loosely fold your wedding gown before storing it, and store it away from sunlight because direct sunlight will cause it to yellow. Protect it from light in an acid-free chest covering it in acid-free tissue paper. Don't store the dress in plastic or hang it up., Put your box in your closet or under your bed away from the light and far from any areas with mold or mildew. Now you can take it out and admire it whenever you want to look back on your wedding day.

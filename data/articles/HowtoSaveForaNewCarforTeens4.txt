 Don’t bow to peer pressure by feeling that you need to buy the latest fashions or newest gadgets. Think about whether the instant gratification that some of these items will give you are worth the dent in your savings account. This will also help you start to rethink your relationship with material goods.
 If you want to buy some music, download 1-2 songs, rather than the entire album. For other items, do some price comparisons between stores, or between stores and online prices. You might find that you can save money by shopping around.
 If you need to use your spending money to buy clothes, books, and so on, buy used items rather than brand new items. Alternately, wait for sales to buy things that you really want, such as around holidays or at the end of the season.
 If you want to buy something, wait a week before buying it. This will give you time to reconsider if you really need the item. Chances are you’ll find that you’d rather keep the money for your car.

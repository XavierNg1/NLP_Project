 Far to often you see amateurs pull out their sand wedge or lob wedge when they have endless amounts of green to work with. Learning to bump and run with a pitching wedge or even a 9 iron pays off quickly. Obviously, when you have less green to work with go with that SW or LW (even open up the clubface and flop it).;
, For right handed golfers, address the ball in your normal stance, then move your left foot back 6 inches (15.2Â cm). Keep your club face aimed at the target (this will make your club face slightly opened). The idea is to open your hips allowing the ball to rise and land softly.
 A golfer may have the right stance but will have bad balance from leaning on his back leg. You need to put 60-70% of your weight on the front leg when chipping. This gives consistent solid contact and avoids 'thin' or 'fat' chips.
 Depending on whether you are playing a bump and run or flopping it, how you finish with the club dictates how the ball will fly. A low finish will cause the ball to fly lower and run further while a high finish accelerates through the shot creating a high, soft ball flight.

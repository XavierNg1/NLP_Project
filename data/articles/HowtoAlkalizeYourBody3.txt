 Claims that an alkaline diet and lifestyle will make your body more alkaline are false. In fact, the body has multiple complex mechanisms for keeping the pH level of its blood in a relatively narrow range between 7.35 and 7.45.While other fluids (like urine and the contents of the stomach) can have different pH levels, these are not by themselves a sign of your overall health.


Note that a blood pH level outside of this narrow range can cause dangerous conditions called acidosis (if the pH gets too low) and alkalosis (if the pH gets too high). It's generally impossible for healthy people to get either of these conditions simply through diet and lifestyle changes.
 Some sources unfortunately claim that an alkaline diet offers protection against serious health problems like cancer. There is no scientific grounding for these claims. If you have a major health problem, do not prioritize an alkaline diet over proper medical care.


The basis for claims that alkaline diets help cure cancer are a few studies that show that certain cancer cells can grow faster in acidic solutions. However, these studies were performed in test tubes â€” not in human bodies. In fact, the differences between the conditions in a test tube and those in the human body are so great that it can't be said with certainty that an alkaline diet wouldn't be harmful in a real-world situation.
 As noted above, a harmful condition called alkalosis occurs when the pH of the blood is too high. This is almost always a cause of disease, organ damage, altitude sickness, or poisoning.Because alkalosis is so dangerous, it's important to never attempt to artificially raise your blood pH level directly (via injection, drinking a strong alkaline solution, etc.) This mistake can be deadly.


Symptoms of alkalosis include nausea, confusion, headache, muscle spasms, light-headedness, and numbness in the face or limbs.

 Tracking and customer information is stored in one place, usually in the website’s CRM software. Sign into this account and click on “Orders” to see information about your pending orders.
 Sometimes a site will use information that they already have on file and if you move too quickly through the ordering process, you'll miss mistakes and end up with a lost order and you'll spend some time on the phone figuring out what went wrong. Double check the following information:


Mailing address (where to send the order)
Billing address (the address associated with the credit card used)
Phone number or email so you can be contacted for more info or in case of updates. You may want to stick to email-only if you do not trust the company not to use spam calls.
 Save it to your hard drive. You'll probably get a confirmation email soon, but this is good insurance in case you don't. Make sure to include the confirmation and/or order number in your screenshot.

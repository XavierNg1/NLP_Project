 The beans are already cooked, so they don't need further cooking to soften them. However, the manner in which you prepare them matters to ensure a good taste.
 Rinse the beans under cold, running water to remove the brine or canned liquid. Once again, this is about removing the element that increases flatulence, as well as improving flavor.
 Once rinsed, the canned pinto beans are ready for use in any recipe or pur√©e.

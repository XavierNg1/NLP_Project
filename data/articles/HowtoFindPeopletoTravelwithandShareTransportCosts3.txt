 You don't want to agree to travel with someone without meeting them first. For your safety, meet in a public place first. See if you click with the person and feel comfortable with them. Meet them a few more times before planning an official trip.Send someone an email or message saying something like, "Hey, can we meet in person to talk before committing to plans? Let's try to get to another a bit before planning a trip together."
Ask questions. Ask things like, "Have you ever travelled with someone you met online before?" and "What kind of things do you hope to do on this trip?"

, In general, it's a bad idea to exchange your home address with a travel companion right away. If a companion asks you for your home address for any reason, do not give it out unless you've met in person.Once you've taken a trip with someone, and the two of you know each other, it's perfect acceptable to exchange addresses so you can write each other letters and send each other mail.
 Make sure your companion is who they say they are. Everyone traveling together should share things like driver's licenses and passports. Do not be shy about asking your potential companion for identification. They will probably want to see your I.D. as well., The adage "go with your gut" comes in handy here. If you don't feel comfortable with someone, you should not travel with them. If someone sends you any red flags, such as being withholding about personal information, look for another travel companion.If someone seems deceptive about their personal life, or tells conflicting stories about things like their work, living situation, and so on, this person may not be a great travel companion.
A good travel companion should not have a lot to hide, and should understand your need for some transparency.

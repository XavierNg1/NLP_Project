 If using one of those workbooks saved under a new name for this article, look for the word NEW or MODIFIED by the Step or Sub-Step (as otherwise all but the last few steps on creating the unique chart were directly copied and organized into sub-steps were directly copied from Create a Dakini and Boddhisattva Aspect of the Mother Planet). Save the workbook under the filename that makes sense to you in your line of endeavor. The source file for these articles is "Eggies.xlsx". It is presumed you've copied and renamed "How to Create a Dakini and Boddhisattva Aspect of the Mother Planet" as far as the NEW and MODIFIED and MODIFIED AGAIN comments apply.

But if 80% of Normal is the New Goal, say for a Personal Fitness Program, then a little math is required.Â  ShrinkExpand2 = 1/.80, or 1.25 would be the new input. This is because it was thought the natural trend would be to want to shrink by say a factor of 2, so 2 = 1/.50 and the New Goal is to be 50% of Normal, or shrink by a factor of 2 (as a divisor). You may change the formulas and comments so that ShrinkExpand and ShrinkExpand2 are multiplicative instead of divisive if preferred. Was 1.19122798149309. Now =(1/E2890)^(3/2)" Expand the comment frame if need be. In cell E2890 should be the formula "=MAX(E6:E2886)"and above it the MIN formula.

Select cell C6 and do Insert New Comment and edit it "Original Formula =Spheroids/KEY*(COS((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))". Expand the comment frame if need be. This formula and the next one form the ring the Spheroids occupy, By taking the cosine of the cell 6 rows above the cell it's in, C6, the formula is taking the cosine of 0, which = 1.
Edit Go To cell range D6:D2886 and with D6 the active high-lighted cell input "=Spheroids/KEY*(SIN((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))" and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell D6 and do Insert New Comment and edit it "Original Formula =Spheroids/KEY*(SIN((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1)). By taking the sine of the cell 6 rows above the cell we're in, C6, the formula is taking the sine of 0, which = 0. Therefore, between the formula in C6 and the one in D6, the {x,y} coordinates of the first cell would be {1,0} if nothing else were affecting them. It proceeds counterclockwise from there. so that is how to read the chart, from 0 degrees counter clockwise back to 360 degrees. Even though there are basically 2880 rows being charted, and 2880/360 = 8, Factor1 = 1/8th at .125, so a level of detail is achieved while keeping everything normalized for a single cycle in the typical case.

This is then multiplied by the Lookup Table SpreadLooker, which either randomizes the data or accepts inputs per the Goal Looker worksheet. Lastly, it is subject to ShrinkExpand, a variable for normalizing or growing or shrinking its chart relative to the Standard or Goal chart data series of Second X and Second Y." Expand the comment frame as much as necessary. I realize that there may be #NAME? error values -- these will be fixed in a little while when the Lookup Tables are completed.

 To get a good chart, columns E:N of the Data worksheet should generally be error-free. See the Warnings section below for help in errors reduction.,

MODIFIED: Activate Data worksheet and Edit Go To cell range H6:I2886. Either do Chart Wizard or select Chart on the Ribbon (activated in Preferences) and select All, Scattered, Smoothed Line Scattered. If using Chart Wizard, a new Chart worksheet will be created. Otherwise, copy or cut and paste the chart into the upper left corner of the Chart worksheet you created at the beginning, and hover the mouse over the lower right corner until it becomes a double-headed arrow and then use it to pull the chart into an expansion of a large Square. When I do it, sometimes it does not work right and it takes another column instead of column H. Click on the second standard ring series, or double-click until it appears in the formula bar and edit it until it reads as follows: =SERIES(,Data!$H$6:$H$2886,Data!$I$6:$I$2886,1). Edit the line of Series 1 to be solid and .5 point line weight and slightly yellowish Green in hue. It has no glow. This is the ring of 12 large spheres.

 Ensure your horses are in stalls that provide proper ventilation, even in the winter. Ventilation in the walkways is not enough. Each stall should have at least a one-foot (0.3m) opening to ensure that the excess ammonia gas can leave the stall.


In high concentrations, ammonia can cause respiratory damage and even death., Make sure you clean underneath the mats at least once week.
 Wheat straw has been found to reduce ammonia. Kenaf fiber is also helpful in reducing ammonia levels. The most absorbent bedding is porous flooring like packed dirt, clay, or even stone dust.


Use tightly interlocking or seamless stall mats to keep the urine from seeping into the floor underneath the bedding., Remove the horses from their stalls for a daily cleaning. Get rid of all urine-soaked bedding and dispose of it. It is important to let the horses out of their stall when cleaning or preparing ammonia neutralizers.
 You can use diatomaceous earth or a clinoptilolite-based product. This increases the absorbency of the materials, lowering the amount of bacteria that is converted into ammonia.Use a ratio of 1:8 for the ammonia neutralizing agent.
 Use a stable shovel and dump two scoops of bedding into the stall. Spread out the bedding with the shovel. Continue to shovel and spread the bedding in increments of two scoops. If you're leaving the horse in the stall overnight, use between 4 to 6 inches of bedding.

If the horse is in and out of the stall and you have mats, cover the mats with about 2 inches of bedding.

 Blackwork is created using a "stabbing motion". This action takes the thread from front to back and back to front. It is absolutely essential to avoid gliding across the fabric.;
, When you first start blackwork embroidery, be sure to choose something simple for practice purposes. The first attempts will likely not provide the appearance you're wanting but keep trying.
 Blackwork must be exact and even; uneven fabrics will skew this and create an unbalance embroidery that doesn't provide a pleasing appearance.
 Do not use thread that is larger than the count of the fabric. If you try to do this, the larger holes will create a distortion, introducing undesirable unevenness to the design.
 The best needle is a blunt tapestry needle because it will be less likely to split the even weave threads. Note that the risk of splitting is a concern to be wary of as you undertake blackwork embroidery.
 A waste knot involves leaving a knot on the surface of the fabric, a short distance from the starting point of the embroidery.
 This article is merely about preparing for blackwork embroidery. wikiHow now needs lots more articles on the actual stitches involved in blackwork (with pictures where possible), as well as copyright free patterns. If you can help us to build up our needlework section, your help to build this volunteer-driven project will be greatly appreciated.

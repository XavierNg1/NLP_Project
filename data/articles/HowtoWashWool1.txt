 Fill up a clean bucket or tub with lukewarm water, then add a mild liquid detergent formulated for delicate fabrics and materials. Check the label for instructions on how much detergent to add, or add about Â½ cup (118.29 ml)., Place the wool garment into the bucket of soapy water and dunk it to completely wet it. Then use your hands to gently swish the wool item around in the water for about a minute.This gentle swishing mimics the motion of a washing machine and allows the soap to pass through the wool and remove dirt or impurities.
 After about a minute of swishing the wool item around in the water, let the garment sit and soak in the water for about ten minutes., After ten minutes, take the wool garment out of the water. Roll the wool item from one corner to another into a ball and squeeze the balled garment to press out excess water, then place the garment aside., Empty the bucket or tub entirely of the soapy water. Then fill the tub back up with clean, tepid water so that you can rinse the wool again., Place the wool garment back in the tub of clean water, then swish it around just as you did before. Swishing the garment will wash the remaining soap out of the wool., The one wash in clean water should have removed all of the laundry soap. However, if the water is extremely soapy and it seems like there is still soap ingrained in the wool, pour the water out, fill it back up with clean water, and repeat the process of swishing the garment around in the clean water.

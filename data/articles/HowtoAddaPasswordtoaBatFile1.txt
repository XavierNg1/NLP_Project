:A
echo enter password to activate program.
set/p "pass=>"
if NOT %pass%== passwordhere goto :FAIL

:FAIL

echo Invalid password. If you want to write additional text you can. If you want to have time between the first line of text and the second line of text add a line that says 'ping localhost (number)'. This designates the amount of time between each line of text. Put it between the second and third line. If you want your program to run slowly and give people time to use each line of text, make the ping localhost time longer. The pause in between each line of text that shows up from the code would be the ping localhost time. If you want the program to say 'Hello' and then say 'how are you' five seconds later, you would write ping localhost 5
goto :end

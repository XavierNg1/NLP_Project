 Compose a new message using any webmail or email client application you have, and address it to receipts@expensify.com.;
, You need to write the correct information regarding the receipts you’re about to send:


If you’re sending multiple receipts with different types, specify in the subject line of your email any common information that can be used to classify those receipts as one.

For example, if you’re sending plane tickets, and taxi and hotel receipts from your trip or vacation, put in the subject line “Vacation Receipts” to put these documents into one group of expense.


If you want to create a new expense on your account, enter in the subject line the amount of the receipt followed by a short description.

For example, if you want to create a new expense for the $500 credit card receipt you’re about to send, put in the subject line: “$500 – Credit Card.” The next time you send a credit card receipt, all you need to do is to take a picture of it and email it to Expensify.
 Expensify needs the proof of purchase (receipt) before it can add the expense. Attach the receipts you want to add to your expense to your email. You can simply take a picture of the receipt and attach it to the message. File formats that you can send to Expensify are as follows:


Picture files that have the JPEG, GIF, PNG, or PDF formats
Text or HTML email files (email receipts that are sent to your email account when you purchase something online)
Document files that have the DOC or Rich Text File formats

, Click the “Send” button of your email application to send the email with the receipts attached. Expensify will add the receipts to your account and expense reports.

 Get out a strainer, and pour the rice in it. Run it under water for a few minutes, moving the rice around with your hand to make sure it gets rinsed. Shake off the excess water., Pour in the cup of rice you just rinsed, the 2 cups of chicken stock, the tablespoon of butter (if you're using it), the 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and the pinch of saffron. Give it a gentle stir to incorporate the ingredients., Turn the heat on high to bring the pot to a boil. Once it's boiling, turn the heat down to low. let it simmer for about 20 minutes. When you lift the lid, make sure the rice has absorbed all the stock.
 Use a fork to fluff up the rice. Scoop the rice onto bowls or plates and serve. This dish works best as a side dish.

 A jig is a tool that controls the motion of another cutting tool. Jigs let you produce accurate duplicates in a repeatable way.


For a 3-dimensional object you will need a jig that can move in all directions. For copying a relief you will only need two dimensions of movement.
You can build one of these machines yourself and equip it with a router, or you can buy a kit at a reasonable cost.
Duplication machines and jigs are based on an ancient technology called a pantograph, which uses the principle of parallel lines to create a duplicate.

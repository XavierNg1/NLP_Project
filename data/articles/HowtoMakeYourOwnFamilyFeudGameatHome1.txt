 This is most effective if you have access to a large group of people, such as a class of students or an office. Keep the questions basic so that you can get a good number of similar responses. For example, you could ask about favorite colors, or what they had for breakfast. Asking something more subjective, like favorite movies, will cause too much variation.;
, If you don't have a group to survey, or you don't get enough similar answers, look online for common survey questions and responses.
 The host will need to be able to see the top 5 responses for each question in the game.

 Socializing with other dogs in your household is best done away from home, for example, while on a walk.
 (And keep them separate in the car ride home.)

, Your puppy is NOT vaccinated yet.
 Only use distraction if either looks unhappy with the situation.


Your oldest dog will be more distracted by the new sights and smells surrounding it, and will probably take short notice to the newcomer.

 Like any other tool, using your razor properly will help keep it working well for some time. Use water or moisturizer on your face to loosen the hairs, and rinse the blade as you shave to remove excess hair and dead skin., Shake away the excess moisture, then dab, don't wipe, the razor on a soft towel. You can also use a blow-dryer or fan, or even just hang it upside down to let the water drip off. Make sure that the razor has dried completely., After drying your razor, rubbing a little bit of rust-preventing oil (like mineral oil or petroleum jelly) on the blade can help keep moisture away.You don't need to dunk the razor in oil. Just a thin application should do the trick.
This step is really only for a straight razor. If your disposable razor begins to rust, it is better just throw it away and use a new one.
 Humidity causes rust, and after a hot shower, your bathroom can be very humid. Make sure your bathroom airs out, or store the razor in a drawer or other place away from the wet air.

 A mentor checks in regularly with their mentee. That means that you need to give yourself regular progress reports. Set aside time to think about what progress you have made in reaching your goals.Choose a time to check in. It can be once a week or once a month. Just make sure to put it on your calendar so that you don't forget.
Look at your short term goals. Have you been actively applying for jobs? You can consider that as making progress.
Reflect on your long-term goals. Ask yourself, "Am I making progress?"

, Remember, it is a mentor's job to be encouraging. Maybe at times you will feel like you won't have made much progress. That's completely normal. Try giving yourself some positive reinforcement.Take time to relax. If you're working too hard, you might need a break. Schedule a day off for yourself.
Do something you enjoy, such as reading a good book or playing a game of tennis with a friend.
 As you measure your progress, you should take some time to evaluate what's working. If you are not making progress as rapidly as you would like, you may need to make some changes.

For example, maybe you are meeting your goal of applying for 6 jobs a month. If you haven't landed a new position yet, consider raising that number to 10.
 When you act as your own mentor, you are likely your own best adviser. However, that does not mean that you shouldn't listen to anyone else. You should still seek advice and guidance from others that you trust. For example, you could ask your boss, "Could you let me know if there are areas where I could improve? I'd love to be considered for a promotion in the next year."

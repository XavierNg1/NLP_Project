, Chicago style calls for the use of footnotes, which requires you to put a number in the text beside the information you’re citing, and the corresponding footnote to that number at the bottom of the page.Footnotes should be formatted as: Author’s last name, Title (City of publication: Publisher, year of publication), page number.
Example footnote: Miller, Death of a Salesman (New York: Penguin, 1998), 65.
If you cite the same source twice consecutively, the second footnote would say “Ibid., .” “Ibid” is Latin for “In the same place,” and denotes you are citing the same source again.

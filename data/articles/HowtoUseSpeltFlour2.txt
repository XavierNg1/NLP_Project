 In addition to fiber, spelt also includes manganese, niacin, copper, phosphorous, protein and vitamin B2.


Spelt is available in two different forms. You can either come by white spelt, or whole spelt. The only real difference is that the white spelt mix has removed the germ and bran from the grain. This might make the bread taste better and increase its sweet flavoring, but it will also remove some of the many health benefits included in the germ and bran in the spelt flour.

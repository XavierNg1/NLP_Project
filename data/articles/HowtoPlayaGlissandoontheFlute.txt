,, A glissando is indicated by a squiggly line traveling downwards or upwards diagonally. See what note the fall starts on and what it ends on. How long is the starting note?

, Start out slowly and eventually speed up. If you are not as experienced, a simple scale in whatever key the piece is will work, but you should still start and end on the same notes.
 Start on the first note of the glissando and play a chromatic scale down to the last note. The glissando should last as long as the first note is notated. So, if the first note is a half note, the glissando would last two beats. Then play the last note of the glissando for as long as the music indicates.
 You should attack the first note at the same time as if you were playing no glissando. You should arrive at and release the second note at the same time as if you were playing no glissando. That means you don't have a lot of time to dwell on all the notes in between. It's more important to keep the notes at either end in time, than to clearly hit every note on the chromatic scale in between.

 No matter what size the paint spill, carefully use a putty knife or any sort of flat tool to scoop up paint that is sitting on top of the carpet, not yet soaked down into the fibers.Scoop up as much excess paint as you can without spreading the paint around.


Wipe off the collected paint with a paper towels, and throw the towels away in the garbage.;
, Use a paper towel or clean rag to blot and absorb as much wet paint as you can.Lift your towel up and down and gently dab at the paint. Adjust the towel so you are always dabbing at the paint with a clean section.


Don’t rub or try to scrub the paint out; that will merely spread the paint around and push it deeper into the carpet.
 Mix a cleaning solution of 1 cup of warm water with ¼ - 1 teaspoon of mild dish soap.Use another clean towel to drip on a small amount of cleaning solution onto the paint.


Let the cleaning solution sit on the carpet for a few of minutes., After the solution has had some time to soak on the paint, dip a clean paper towel or rag into the cleaning solution and continue to blot at the wet paint.Always adjust the cloth so you are blotting with a clean section. Keep blotting at the stain until your cloth no longer absorbs any of the paint.Blot from the outside of the paint, moving inward; this will prevent you from spreading out the stain even further.If the stain still remains, repeat the cleaning process with the soapy water, or move on to using vinegar to blot at the paint.Vinegar works well with removing water-based paints like latex paint., Once the paint stain is removed, use a clean paper towel or rag to blot at the wet area and soak up any remaining moisture. It should take about a day for the carpet to completely dry.


You could even sit a heavy object on top of layers of paper towels to soak up moisture overnight., If the stain is persistent and can’t be removed completely with all of your cleaning efforts, consider calling a professional carpet cleaner service to clean the rest of the remaining paint.A professional carpet cleaner will have the necessary cleaning chemicals and tools to adequately remove any lingering paint stains.

 Start by folding over the edge of your sashay yarn to hide the unfinished edge. You can just fold over the first five stitches of your sashay yarn to start., To make your first gathered stitch, insert the hook through the first nine loops in your row. Then, skip the tenth loop and insert through the eleventh loop. Pull this loop through the other nine loops on your hook to make your first ruffle., Next, fold youâ€™re your yarn so that you have 11 loops lined up. Then, repeat the gathering stitch.Continue to fold over and gather all the way to the end of your ball of yarn. When you are finished, you will have a ruffle scarf.

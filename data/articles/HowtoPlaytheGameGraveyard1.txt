 You will need one person to be it, and at least two other competitors.  The magic number is around eight, but it's okay if you don't have enough people.;
, Make sure there is plenty of space for everyone to move around. The designated place should also be clean, because people will be lying on the ground.
 You can do rock, paper, scissors, or just blindly choose a person. It does not matter who the "it" is, but there needs to be one.
 During that time, the players need to assemble into a position on the ground. Once time is up, everyone needs to be still. Anyone caught moving by the person that is it is eliminated.
 The only things you are allowed to move are your eyelids. You cannot move your mouth, legs, or hands.


Realize that even if you move, you are not out unless the person playing "it" sees it. This applies even if another player catches you.
 Once the person that is it catches you, you are out. Eliminated players can help "it" check the remaining players for movements, but they cannot eliminate players themselves. They can, however, tip "it" about where to look for movements.

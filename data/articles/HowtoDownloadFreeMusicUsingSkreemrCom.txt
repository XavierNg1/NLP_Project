 Make sure iTunes is the default music player for ALL music formats.;
, Download the plugin for Firefox called Unplug.


Make sure you are getting the version that does not open op in a pop-up window, but one that opens up right over the page you are on. The pop-up window does not allow you to specify where you want the music saved.
The best site to go to for this is Skreemr.com, because it has most songs, and they are all downloadable. If you can find another site that works, then good for you.
 When you think you have found the song you are looking for, press the arrow in the box to play the song and check if it is the right one.
 If it is, then while staying on that page, right-click on a blank area of the page, and choose the option UNPLUG.






Save the file. A tab will open right over that one, this is unplug.



Save it to the iTunes folder, and if you don't already have a folder for that artist, make one named whatever the artist of the song is.

 Measure your height and measure the length of the gun on your sketch. Sig's gun is somewhere around 1/2 in length. Divide your height by three and separate into two parts, one twice the length of the other.
 Divide the line up into two parts like above, and label the lengths. Using the sketch you made earlier, trace the detail on the gun to your plans.

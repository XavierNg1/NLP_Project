 It's like someone in Pokémon Black/White/Black 2/White 2 said: "Pokémon don't need any special treatment to form a bond. Just being with you makes them happy." So don't think giving Pokémon a bunch of poffins in Pokémon-Amie is going to make your Pokémon love you. You have to have them get to know you well. Use lots of Max and Super Repels, so you don't get driven crazy the next time you see a horde of Gulpin or that one annoying Whismur you can't seem to shake off.;
, The Herboriste shop in Lumiose City is know to sell herbs that restore HP/revive Pokémon, but lower their happiness level. Nobody likes to take bitter medicine! That's something we can all learn from toddlers and preschoolers everywhere!

, This item's "echoed chime" makes the Pokémon more friendly towards you. But if your Pokémon is already holding an important item (type-resistance berry, Mega Stone, etc.), this step is optional.
 This can be obtained by having any Pokémon (Works well if it is "pumped up") punch the normal black punching bag repeatedly. It should say something along the lines of "Whoa! Your managed to find a Soothe Bag!"

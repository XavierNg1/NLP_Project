 Make sure you come from the side, not the front or back, where the horse may not see you. Don't make any sudden movements that may scare the horse.;
, If his ears are flattened or if he is showing any other signs of aggression, it may be safer to keep away. Let the horse sniff your hand.
 Most people will greet a horse by stroking his nose or face, but this is not the proper way to do it, unless the horse knows you very well and doesn't mind you touching his face.
 If you do this, the horse will know what to expect, and therefore trust you more.
 In the wild, horses greet each other by blowing on each other's noses. If the horse blows back, you'll have a new friend!

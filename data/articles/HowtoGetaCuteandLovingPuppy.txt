 List breeds that you like, list the specific gender you are looking for (if you care), list the temperament, the color, and possibly the personality.;
, Look up the history of the specific breeds you like. Look at their sizes, their habits, their temperament. Are they good with kids? Do they get along with other dogs or other animals? What type of life can you provide them? Is it suitable for that specific breed?

, Maybe you can rescue and rehabilitate an older dog, or give a puppy a chance. If you can't find one locally, check at other towns. And if you can't find one there either, you might have to have one shipped in from another state.
 Play with the puppy. Is he/she energetic? Does he/she growl or bite? (However, remember that puppies will often mouth or nip on hands.) If there are litter mates, do they look healthy and are they playful and good tempered?


Briefly examine the puppy for possible health issues. Ask to see veterinarian documents.
 Here would be the time to look at cost. Are you willing to pay that much? If money is not a factor, or the price is reasonable, call the breeder/wherever you are getting the puppy/dog from, and talk to them. If you want, now would be the time to negotiate price.
 Have everything ready for the dog when they come, to make the transition easier. Now see how they react with your other animals/children. If you like what you see, then welcome your new family member home!!!!

, If there is something wrong with the puppy, consider returning it. Some shelters will take back animals with shelter-borne diseases for treatment.

 The best method is to save your Master Ball for Latios, since it tends to flee. If you did not save your Master Ball, you'll need to see the next section of this article. You can scroll down or use the Table of Contents at the top.
 Latios is a roaming Pokémon and will be found just about anywhere. To make Latios easier to catch, you'll want to go in an area where you can reload easily, such as opening up a cave near a field using a secret power.
 Search around through the grass or other environment until you find Latios. Don't waste time fighting other Pokémon; run from any other battles. If you haven't found Latios in an area after 5 minutes of running around, exit the area and reenter.

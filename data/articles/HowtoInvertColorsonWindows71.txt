 Type "Magnifier" in the search box. Click on the Magnifier application to open it.


When the Magnifier application opens, your screen will be zoomed in. Click the negative button (-) until you're zoomed out all the way.
 Put a check in the box that says "Turn on color inversion." Then click "OK" to finish inverting your colors. The options for the Magnifier do not change if you leave the application, so you will only need to do this once.
 Click "Pin to taskbar." You'll now be able to invert your screen colors by right-clicking and choosing "Close window" to restore the colors. To transfer them back to their inverted state, click the icon once.

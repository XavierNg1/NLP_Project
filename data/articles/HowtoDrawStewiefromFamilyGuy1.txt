 This will be the head with ears on either side of it.;
, It should be composed of very straight lines; Stewie's body has almost no shape since he's only a child.
 Draw two butts on the sides of the rectangle and two smaller ones both on the lower end. These shapes will serve as Stewie's hands and feet.
 One should be horizontal and one should be vertical, crossing where you want the middle of the head to be.
 These features should be just a bit above the perpendicular lines.
 Put an "L" shape below it to serve as the mouth.
 Draw two horizontal lines on each eye and one-half circle for each iris. Draw four curved lines for his sleeves and pants. Sketch two rectangles with circles at the end below his head for his jumper.
 Make sure no excess guidelines remain.

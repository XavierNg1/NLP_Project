 If your child has a standard UTI (one that occurs in the lower urinary tract and bladder and is not recurrent) then he or she should take antibiotics to clear up the infection. The standard treatment is a four-day oral antibiotic course, though the course can sometimes last for longer than four days depending on the type of antibiotic prescribed. Commonly prescribed antibiotics include:


Trimethoprim.
Sulfamethoxazole.
Augmentin (a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate).;
, Infants who are younger than one month old and are thought to have a UTI must be taken to the hospital immediately. UTIs can be dangerous for infants who are younger than one month old.If you have an infant who is younger than two months old and is showing signs of a UTI combined with a fever, you should also take him/her to the hospital. There is a chance that the UTI is in the kidney rather than the bladder.
 While the UTI might be treated while the antibiotic is being taken, the UTI will more than likely come back as soon as your child stops taking the antibiotics. Therefore, routine use of antibiotics to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections in children and adolescents is generally not recommended since outcomes are not significantly improved with this practice.The additional risk, of course, is that overuse of antibiotics will more rapidly lead to increasing numbers of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

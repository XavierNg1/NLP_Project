, Special, personal items, such as photos, tickets, cards, and other flat memorabilia work very well. You can look through magazines and cut-out anything that strikes your fancy as well.
 You can hang up some 3-D objects, as long as they aren't too heavy. Pin them to the board using a thumb tack or pushpin. Here are some ideas of small 3-D objects that you can hang up:


Key chains
Necklaces and bracelets
Pendants
Pins

, You make a collage by layering and overlapping your items. You can also arrange everything in a grid-like pattern with no overlapping.
 This is a great way to make your board even more unique. Here are some ideas of what you can pin up:


1st place science fair medals
Award winning essays
Personal artwork
Postcards, birthday cards, or other holiday cards
Tickets to concerts and movies

, There is a good chance that a parent, sibling, or friend might see your board. If you have something very personal, you might want to leave it off and keep it some place safe so that it doesn't get lost or ruined.

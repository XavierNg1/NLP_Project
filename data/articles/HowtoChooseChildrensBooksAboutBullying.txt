 You want a book that both shows the negative reality of bullying and that encourages a child to do the right thing in a bullying situation, for any age of child. However, the same book can't be used for any age due to the potentially graphic or traumatic nature of bullying, the level of skill necessary to read the book, and the potential for boredom if the book is too hard or easy to understand.
 In most cases, picking a book that doesn't make it obvious that you are trying to educate the child about bullying or fix a problem, is best. Otherwise the child might feel embarrassed or not be as interested if they feel the book is to teach them a lesson.

 For example, visit Figgs caf√©, Flem Manor, Flum's fountain or Tums diner.
 Say: "Huge Party at Mine Say Boom to Come!" When loads of weevils say boom, invite them.


You will need to invite the weevils over to your nest if they say boom, or whichever word they say to come to the party.
 When you think that you have invited enough weevils, go to your nest. Your weevils will be waiting for you and you can meet new weevils or make buddies. Meanwhile, you will earn mulch and XP, as they rate your rooms.


Just be aware that you will become popular (either a tip or a warning, depending on your preference).

 If you don’t have a particularly advanced camera you can still blur the background of a photograph by using your camera’s other settings like portrait mode which will adjust the camera automatically to help you with the desired effect.The portrait mode is found on the dial usually under the “P” or the little image of a woman. Switch your dial to Portrait mode to have your camera automatically adjust your aperture and shutter speed.
 You can hit the “Menu” button on your camera and navigate to the focus selection. In a lot of cameras you will see several boxes with the center one filled in.


Move your cursor to fill in one of the other boxes that will be closest to where your subject’s eyes are.
This will allow the camera to automatically focus the most on your selected area, blurring the rest out the further away from the focus area an object is.
 You can manually narrow your depth of field if you don’t have a lens that will easily do it for you by creating a large distance between the foreground and background.


If you are taking a photo of your subject in front of say, a wall, then try and move them 10 or so feet away from the wall. With your portrait mode set, your camera should be able to blur the background on its own.



You’ll have to play with distance here depending on how far your lens can zoom. You want to be able to zoom in as far as possible while still getting both your subject and some background in the shot.This method will mean that there will be less background in your photo, but it will help you get the desired effect. Your subject will remain the same and only the background will shrink if you zoom correctly. But it will help to blur the background.

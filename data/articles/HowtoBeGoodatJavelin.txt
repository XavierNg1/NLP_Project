 In javelin you run a length on track while wielding a javelin. You throw a javelin before you pass the white line. The javelin sticks in the air where it lands.;
, Try running a 10 meter (32.8Â ft) dash 20 times a day. long-distance running can be used but also makes you want to run past the white line.
 Throw a 10 pound weight as far as you can 10 times a day. You may lower and heighten the weight as you wish. Do overdo it, as the javelin only weighs 2-3 pounds.
 Without proper follow through, the javelin won't go as far and you are likely to pull a muscle.
 When running, remember to run your hardest. You will only need to do this for short while.

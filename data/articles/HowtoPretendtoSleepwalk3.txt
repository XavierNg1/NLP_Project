 Upon waking, sleepwalkers experience extreme disorientation. When you "wake up" during your fake sleepwalk, make sure to appear very confused. Look around you as though you have no idea where you are or how you got there.
 When sleepwalkers are startled awake in the middle of an episode, they sometimes react by lashing out in fear and confusion. If you decide to allow yourself to be woken up during your routine, do it suddenly. Make your actions erratic and jerky immediately upon waking.
 Sleepwalkers are so confused if woken up during an episode that they generally communicate very little with the person that woke them. Any communication that does take place is usually incoherent and the sleepwalker goes back to sleep very quickly after the event.
 Because sleepwalkers are so hard to wake up, sometimes they are able to get through the entire episode asleep. When this happens, the sleepwalking event usually ends abruptly and spontaneously and the person goes back to bed.

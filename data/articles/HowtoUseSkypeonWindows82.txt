 You can download Skype for Windows Desktop, which acts just like Skype in previous versions of Windows.
 Click the "Download Skype" button and then "Get Skype for Windows desktop" to begin the download.
 Follow the prompts in the installer to install Skype for Windows desktop on your computer. Most users can leave all the installer options at their default settings.
 You should be able to find a shortcut to Skype on your desktop. If you can't find it, open the Start screen, click the "Down" arrow at the bottom of the screen, and find Skype in the list of your installed programs.
 You can log into Skype using your Microsoft account or using your old Skype account. If you don't have an account you can create one for free.
 Click a contact in the list on the left to begin a conversation.
 If you have a webcam installed, you can start a voice or video chat with your contacts. Open a contact's conversation page and click either the phone (voice) or camera (video) to start a chat.
 This button looks like magnifying glass. You can search for other Skype users by their usernames or email addresses.
 Click your profile image in the upper-right corner to change your online status and set your mood.

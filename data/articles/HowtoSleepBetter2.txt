 A full stomach may disrupt your sleep, and, the heavier the meal, the longer it takes for your stomach to settle down.


Avoid greasy foods, as not only are they not good for you but tend to inhibit sleep.
Avoid spicy foods. Some people thrive on heavily spiced foods, but if you find your aunt's curry gives you a stomach-ache at night, seriously reconsider your dinner plans.
 A completely empty stomach may interfere with your sleeping patterns just as much as going to bed with a full stomach.


If you find that your stomach is grumbling for food and is keeping you awake, eat a light snack about an hour before bedtime.
Avoid foods high in carbohydrates or sugar.
High protein foods like turkey, yogurt, soy beans, tuna, and peanuts contain tryptophan, which can help the body produce serotonin in order to relax. They also have natural, complex fats that can satiate your hunger.
 This includes coffee, black teas, cocoa, and caffeinated soda. Caffeine can keep you awake even if you drank it earlier in the day, as its effects can last up to 12 hours. This also includes other stimulants like those found in energy drinks even if they are not caffeine. Avoid tobacco products in the evenings as well.
 Highly recommended beverages include a warm glass of milk or chamomile tea. However, most herbal teas are fine, as long as they do not contain any caffeine.
 Ensure, though, that you drink at least two liters of water during the day.


A well-hydrated body will not wake you from thirst, but drinking a big glass of water just before bed might wake you to go to the bathroom at an inconvenient hour.
 Alcohol will make you feel sleepy, but it will also reduce the quality of your sleep as your body processes the alcohol and sugars. Alcohol tends to produce broken, shallow sleep (even if you don't notice the periods of waking during the night), which does not refresh.

 After you have figured out the measurements for the straps, you will need to decide what fabric to use for your straps. You will want the straps of your dress to look like they match your dress. The easiest way to do this is to find a fabric the same colour as your dress. Most fabric at stores like Jo-Ann Fabrics have fabrics organised by colour.
You may want to bring your dress along with you if you are matching the colour of the strap to the dress.
 Finding the right strap colour for a patterned dress is less straightforward. Pick one of the more dominant colours in the dress and find fabric that matches that colour. For instance, if your dress is beige with yellow flowers and green leaves, try to find fabric that is either beige or yellow, depending on what you prefer.
Even though the straps arenâ€™t patterned, matching the fabric to the main colour in the dress will make the straps look like they belong on the dress.
 If you don't want your straps to match your dress exactly, you could also find a fabric that looks good with it, even if it's not the same colour. For example, if your dress is a pastel yellow, you could find fabric in a pastel green that would look good with your dress colour. More extreme contrasts in color and texture may be more suitable for casual rather than formal dresses.
 If the materials look mismatched, the straps will look out of place.


The easiest way to do this is to match the fabric of the straps to the fabric of the dress. For instance, if you are wearing a silk dress, find a silk fabric for the straps.
You can also pick fabric for the straps that adds a decorative element to the dress. For instance, you can use a lacy or differently-textured fabric to liven up a basic dress.
 Use the measurement in inches you calculated to buy enough fabric for the straps. Many fabric stores measure in yards. You will very likely only need a half a yard, though you may need more if you are making halter straps.

 Often, workplaces do not allow romances between bosses and subordinates.Even if feelings are mutual, things can go very wrong in a workplace romance, especially if there’s a difference of power or position between you. The potential for a sexual harassment accusation can loom for each of you, especially if one of you moves up in the company.A romantic relationship could be interpreted by outsiders as the supervisor taking advantage of their position of power over the intern.
An intern may use the relationship for their own advancement or against the supervisor in the future. The supervisor will be perceived as the authority figure in the relationship and may take the blame if sexual harassment or ethical violation is dealt with in an official manner.
If things do not work well between the two of you, then you have to see the person every day at work. In some situations, you may want to or need to change jobs.
 Many office couples choose to connect in secret, at least at first. However, the secret almost always gets out and the privacy of the relationship fails.Especially if your workplace mandates reporting relationships within the office, it’s best to come out with it or to not pursue it at all.


You may want to keep a romance private at first to protect yourselves or to keep things between the two of you. However, be careful how far you take the relationship in this secrecy.
 If you are attracted to the intern and want to pursue a relationship, it’s likely that one of you will need to exit the company. If you can wait, you may wait until the internship is over. However, if you want to date now, your company may not allow it, which may lead to one of you leaving the company.You may need to discuss work contracts and assess when the relationship could begin. In the meantime, do not act on your relationship while working together.

 Cats like the Birman that are more exclusive and expensive than the typical cat should come with some sort of paper validation affirming their pedigree. Various associations offer pedigree papers that demonstrate the cat's line. For Birman cats, choose a breeder whose cats are registered with a cat registry, particularly one that specializes in Birmans.You should also be careful of putting too much stock in this, as some kitten mills can purchase papers that do not necessarily reflect the cat's lineage. You can inquire into the breeders history breeding Birmans and to meet the parents to put yourself more at ease.
 Even more certain than papers are scientific DNA tests. This may sound complicated and expensive but is both common and affordable for a prospective cat owner. Choose a reputable DNA testing service, particularly one backed by a university or your vet.These tests are typically over 90% accurate.
You will only need to obtain a cotton swab sample from your cat's cheek and follow protocol and send it to the lab for testing. In exchange, they should be able to give you a full report that gives the cat's parentage. This can be done to kitten as well as adults, as your cat's DNA will never change., Especially with more expensive breeds, kitten mills that attempt to sell non-pedigree cats can be a problem. Make sure that you get to see where the kittens were raised, meet the parents if possible and inquire into their experience as a breeder.


Be cautious of deals that seem too good to be true. Although the price of Birman cats can vary considerably based on where you are, you can expect to pay more than a typical cat, and sometimes several hundreds of dollars, depending on the pedigree. If there are Birman cats available for a price that seems too good to be true, inquire with the seller the reasons behind the low asking price.

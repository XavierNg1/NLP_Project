 Use a highlighting eyeshadow brush and get a little highlighter onto the tip. Then, take the brush and press it into the corners of your inner eyelids.








You can apply a couple of layers if you want a more dramatic effect or just apply a light dusting for some subtle highlights.
 The areas just below your eyebrows will catch a lot of light, so this is a nice area to highlight. Try sweeping highlighter over your brow bones, the areas just under your eyebrows.








Try to keep most of the highlighter on the outer edges of your brow bone. You do no need to apply highlighter to your entire brow bone.
You can also extend the highlighter down towards the creases of your eyelids for an extra eye brightening effect., The area in the center of your upper lip is called your cupid’s bow and highlighting this area will draw more attention to your lips. Get a small amount of highlighter on your fingertip and press it onto this area.








Don’t apply the highlighter to your actual lip, just to the area right above your lip.
 Highlighting the center of your chin can also help to draw attention to your lips. Try sweeping some highlighter onto the center of your chin.








Be careful not to apply too much highlighter to this area. You only need a light dusting.
If you highlighted your forehead, then try to keep the highlighter on your chin in line with the highlighter on your forehead.

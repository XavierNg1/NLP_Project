 The Energy Star designation is given to energy-efficient appliances in a program sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy.;

Convection ovens work better the more surface area the food has. That is, they will work better on cookies or muffins than banana bread.
You may need to reduce the baking time a little when using convection.
 Although microwave ovens use more energy than conventional ovens, the shorter cooking time saves energy.
 They let you reduce the oven temperature as much as 25 degrees (13.88 degrees C).
 Don't open the door to peek at the food, as opening the door reduces the temperature by up to 50 degrees (27 degrees C).
 For example, if you're roasting a chicken, you could also roast potatoes and vegetables alongside it. You might even be able to bake bread, biscuits, or dessert.,,,, If you use a large burner for a small pan, you waste electricity or gas. Turn the flame or coil down to the minimum setting for the heat you need to cook your food adequately. For example, smaller pots of water boil when the burner is set lower.
 The more water you use, the more energy is required to bring the water to a boil and keep it boiling.
 Pressure cookers, which are either stovetop or electric, raise the temperature of water before boiling and trap steam. Do a web search for pressure cooker recipes.
, Preparing meals from the beginning uses more energy than reheating food.


Save energy by reheating food on the stove or in the microwave oven rather than a conventional oven.
, This uses less energy than a stove or oven. Grilling outdoors also prevents heat from being released into your house, which may cause increased air conditioner use.
 Using a tea kettle decreases energy by about 1/3.
, Don't wash under running water, especially not hot water.
 Dust and debris insulate the heat exchange process, and reduce your refrigerator's efficiency., Use a cover to prevent splatters. Messy microwaves heat less efficiently.

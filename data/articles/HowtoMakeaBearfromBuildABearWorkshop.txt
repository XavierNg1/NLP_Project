 These also include bunnies, dogs and cats, zoo animals, wild furry friends, exclusive animals and more. Find the one that's best for you or another. Check the price and see if it's affordable in your opinion.;
, After you know what animal you're getting, pick one up from under the shelves. Make sure it's in good condition, the one you want, and if there are any rips or tears. There should only be one hole in its back, which should have a string on it. This is where the stuffing will go.
 If there is a line, wait in it. There should be a person waiting. He/she will ask you to step on the pedal while the person will stuff the bear. Once finished, grab a heart and place it inside the bear. The person will string the back together completely.


Optionally, you can pick out a sound before you string it completely. Go to the sound station, and push the buttons to hear the different sounds. Then search for the drawer with the sound number, and pick a sound device up. Hand it to the assistant when the bear is stuffed.
 Take it to a fluffing table. Pick up a brush, and push the peddle under it. This will blow air out. Comb and fluff your bear gently and neatly.
 There are many to choose. For clothes and accessories, go to the dressing station and dress it up. Make sure it's in good condition, and fits well on the bear.
 Follow what the computer says. Name the bear, and fill out your personal information, such as your address and phone number.
 Needless to say, purchase the stuffed animal and/or clothes, accessories, or furniture. The clerk will hand you a birth certificate of the bear's information you just input in the computer.


Using the birth certificate, you are able to play online.

 If you don't have one, create one. You can't add a tag unless you are signed in.;
,, These are images that can be used with permission for a variety of purposes, including on wikis. Adding this tag will ensure the most use out of the added tags.
 You may see "Tags (add a tag)". Not all images, however, are enabled for tagging. If the person who uploaded the photo enabled it for tagging, you are all set.
 You'll see a dialog box open up directly beneath the word "Tags".
 Ensure that the names you add are relevant and useful. You may wish to add tags for location, genre, personal characteristics, subjects seen in the picture, colors or type of media used. Many images illustrate an emotion or a concept well. So if you add "happy" or "solitude", someone looking to illustrate those concepts will more easily find the photo.
 If you add a phrase, put quotation marks around the phrase in order to make the phrase appear as a single tag. For example:


"Red Flower"
"Children Playing"
"Golden Smile".

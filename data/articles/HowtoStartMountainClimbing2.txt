 You may run regularly, hit the gym for a few hours a day, or find some other way to keep yourself in tip-top shape. But that may not help you with your new hobby. Tailoring a training regimen to the type of climb you plan to do can increase the chances you’ll be successful at it from the start. For short but difficult climbs, you’ll want to make sure you increase your upper-body strength. Mountaineering demands a great deal of endurance, so building strength is a must.
 The only way you’ll know for sure if this is something you want to do is to actually give it a try. Take as much time as you need the first time around; you aren’t expected to be great right away, and it may actually take several tries before you can even get halfway up the wall. A patient, open-minded approach is the only one to take when attempting a climb for the first time.
 While you’re at the climbing gym, watch how others make their way up the wall. You may learn something you can put to immediate use the next time you try. Also, try asking questions. Fellow climbers are a valuable resource—often more so than anything you’ll find online or in magazines.
 If you’re eager to get better quickly, taking lessons is certainly a viable option. Most climbing walls offer an expert who can provide knowledge, expertise, and tips on what you’re doing well and what needs to be improved. Be willing to take whatever advice the trained climber has to offer.

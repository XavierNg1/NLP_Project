 If you’ve tried communicating and compromising and there’s simply no way that your parents will ever be able to embrace your fiancé, you need to stand firm. Be clear that their disapproval will not change how you feel about your partner or your plans for a life together.Say something like, “Mom, Dad, this is my decision to make and your disapproval will not change it. I’m sorry you can’t accept the person I love, but I love you too and always will.”

, When you dreamed of your wedding day, it probably didn’t include your parents sitting there stone-faced in disapproval — or worse, not there at all. Don’t ignore reality and expect everyone to embrace happily on the big day. Instead, make adjustments to your wedding plans to limit unnecessary interactions or even to account for your parents’ absence.If, for instance, you’re having a civil ceremony because your fiancé doesn’t share your religious background, and this upsets your traditionalist parents, don’t try to force them to come. Tell them something like, “Remember, the ceremony is at 2 o’clock at the courthouse. I’ll make sure there are seats for both of you if you decide to come. And I really hope you do.”

, Once you’re married, you’ll have to continue to navigate the difficult relationship between your spouse and your parents. As before, honesty, open communication, and practical adjustments are key. Clear the air when necessary, seek out compromises, and be reasonable about limiting interactions when needed.


For instance, go to family gatherings alone sometimes, or be clear beforehand that the two of you can only stay a set amount of time. You should also plan an exit strategy ahead of time in case things go sour quickly.

 Then place the sheets in the freezer for half an hour prior to making the ice cream balls.;
, Try to make each scoop about as large as your fist. Make as many scoops as will fit on the baking sheets.
 Place the sheets of ice cream balls into the freezer and leave them there for at least 30 minutes and up to two hours.
 Place a bowl of flour, a bowl of beaten egg and a bowl of crushed cereal or fine cookie/cracker crumbs in the workspace, in a formation that makes it easy to dip in order.
 Remove the balls from the freezer, then:


Roll each ice cream ball first in the flour bowl. A little flour over each ball provides increased strength.
Roll each ice cream ball in the beaten egg.
Lastly, roll each ball around in the crushed cereal. (For a tastier treat, you can add cinnamon and sugar to the crushed cereal. Just make sure you still have enough cereal bits on the ice cream to coat the surface of the scoop.)

Alternatively, you may dip the ice cream balls in cake batter to make a thin, donut-like coating. Then either fry the balls directly or sprinkle / roll them in crushed cookie or biscuit crumbs to give a crisp shell. This method can be done immediately before frying, or like the method above may be re-frozen as follows.
 Freeze for at least two hours before frying.


At this point, you can actually keep the ice cream balls frozen for up to two months if needed.
 Heat up the oil until it shimmers - approx 185C or 364F. Fry the ice cream balls in batches two at a time to avoid reducing the temperature of the oil. A low temperature won't fry them crisply. Fry until each ball turns a light/golden brown all over. Remove as soon as it's done.
 Serve immediately after frying, with chocolate or caramel sauce or other favorite sauce.


If you'd like the dessert to be colder, place it back into the freezer for a few more minutes after it's fried, then pull out and serve a little colder. This is a personal preference and isn't essential.

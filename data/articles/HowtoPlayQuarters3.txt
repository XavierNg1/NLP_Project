 Fill a cup up with alcohol of your choosing, and place it in the middle of the table. This cup is known as the "big chug." Place a cup around the big chug for every player that is playing the game. Fill each of these cups up with alcohol as well. Assign each of the cups around the big chug to each of the players. Each player is to memorize where their cup is placed around the big chug., A player attempts to bounce a quarter towards the cups at the center of the table. If the player misses entirely, he or she must drink the contents of their cup. The quarter then passes to the next player on his or her right. If however the player makes it into one of the opponent's cups, that opponent must drink the contents of their cup., If a player bounces the quarter, and it lands in the big chug, new rules kick into place. Every player must pick up their cup of alcohol and drink. The last person to finish their drink must then drink the entire contents of the big chug., This game is typically ended when people are either tired of playing, or too inebriated to continue playing. However, you can establish a point system if you wish to determine a winner. If you bounce the quarter into an opponent's cup, you get 1 point. If you miss all of the cups, you get no points. If you get it in the big chug, you lose 1 point. Finally, the person to lose the big chug drinking challenge loses 2 points.

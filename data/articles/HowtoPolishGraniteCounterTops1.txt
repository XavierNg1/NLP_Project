 Regular maintenance of your granite counter tops will help ensure that you don't have to break out the heavy artillery too often.


Do not use anything with vinegar, citrus, or ammonia! The acidity will dull the finish.
Use warm to hot water and use a soft cloth.
Dry right away to avoid water spots. Use another dry, soft cloth.;
, These will be necessary for heavier jobs.



Important: Make sure you use a stone cleaner that's designed for use on granite. Other types of cleaners can damage your counter tops!
Always refer to the instructions for the product you're using as the specifics may vary from product to product.
 Do this before buffing to remove any food, dust or grime that may have accumulated and could cause stains or scratches.


Spray or mist the cleaner on counter tops and let it stand for about a minute (this time may vary depending on the cleaner you're using).
Wipe the cleaner off with a soft, cotton cloth.

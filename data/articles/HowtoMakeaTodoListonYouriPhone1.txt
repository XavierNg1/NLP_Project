 Press and hold your iPhone's home button until you hear two beeps indicating that you can ask Siri a question.;
, Speak into your microphone (at the bottom of your phone) naturally as you would with another person, and with clear articulation. Say "Remind me to buy milk at 6pm." Siri should respond by saying "OK" and let you create your new reminder.
 You can add as many reminders and tasks as you like in this way. You can find and edit the list of reminders by opening the Reminders app, which is installed on each and every iPhone.

 Pruning branches from mature trees takes a lot of weight off the tree and can change the shape drastically, so it is important to really think about which branches you are going to trim before you make the cut. Pruning branches from mature trees should only be done for specific purposes:Removing dead, diseased or broken branches
Remove branches to create more sunlight or air flow to the canopy of the tree. Be careful doing this as you don’t want to “thin out” the canopy.
 Making a single cut to large branches may cause them to tear off the tree and rip off the bark as they fall. Proper trimming ensures healthy bark:Make an undercut on the branch about 1 to 2 feet out from the branch collar, or the point where it connects to the trunk.
Make a second cut on the top of the branch a few inches farther out that the undercut.
This prevents the falling branch from tearing the bark off of the trunk.
After the bulk of the branch falls, you can trim back the 1 to 2 feet the you left on the tree by cutting it at an angle 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) from the branch collar.
 After pruning the branches from your oak tree, leave the wound alone to let the tree heal itself in the open air.


Prune carefully to not injure the tree excessively, and make sure the tree has plenty of water.
Trees will naturally seal cuts; it is not necessary to apply an artificial sealant as this may trap microorganisms inside the tree and lead to disease.

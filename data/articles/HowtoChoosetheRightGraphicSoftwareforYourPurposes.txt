 You will need to take many things into consideration.;
, Do you need to start out with free software, or do you have lots of money to spend. Don't think that you have to be limited by what you can afford. There are basic free options, like IrfanView and PhotoMeister.

Gimp







Paint.Net







Inkscape







Project Dogwaffle






And a plethora of others. Simply do a search for 'graphic software freeware'.
 Not necessarily with the software, because you are just learning it, but with computers in general. If you are a total newbie to computers, you don't want to start with Gimp or Photoshop or even Paint Shop Pro (unless you are a really quick learner).
 Regardless of your skill, if your computer can't run it without slowing way down, you won't want to use it.
 Do you want to just create quick shapes or objects, edit and catalog images, create vector graphics. There are not a lot of software programs that will do all of that. More than likely, you would need different software for different purposes.

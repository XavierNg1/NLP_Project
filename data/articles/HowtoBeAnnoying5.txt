 Whether Suburban-sized ridiculous or Smart Car-tiny, make sure you do your driving during rush hour, that way you'll be the obnoxious gigantic vehicle on a crowded road that's trying to claim space for itself, or that you're darting in and out of traffic like a deranged eco-bunny.


Always have a trailer attached to your vehicle with nothing on it, or something absurd, like a horse.
 Play something embarrassing while your friends are in the car, like the theme song from "Titanic", little kid songs and nursery rhymes, or really crude gangster rap. Alternatively, play "Rule Britannia" at top volume. This works especially well if you are not in a British country.
 Honk your horn. If you're behind someone at a stoplight, start blaring the horn and don't stop. If you want, you could leave your hand planted on the horn.


When stopped at a traffic light put your head on the steering wheel and pretend to be unconscious or dead and remain stationary. When somebody comes to investigate wake up loudly.
 When driving, pull over when you see pedestrians and wave, smile, and shout with your window down at random people in cars or on the sidewalk. Ask them where an imaginary place is. Become irritated when they don't know.


Yell a random word (e.g. pickle) at someone, then roll your window back up.
Inquire as to the availability of upscale mustards in neighboring automobiles.

 You must tell the seller you are interested in listing their property only after their current listing expires. Tell them you will do a better job for them. Insist you have absolutely no interest in listing this property until its listing expires.
 Explain the agreement would be dated with a date immediately after the expiration of their current contract. They may be more than happy to do this because you gave them advance notice.


Often during the listing - if there is little traffic to the property - or if their agent does not advertise properly on their behalf - they will be excited to sign a postdated listing.
Ensure you tell them again that you have no intent to interrupt or force them to cancel their current contract.
 Meet with the customers and sign the listing, if you have not already signed a post-dated listing while following the previous step. Make a calendar for when to follow up with numerous expiring listings.

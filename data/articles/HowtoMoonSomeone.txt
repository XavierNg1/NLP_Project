 Obviously, you might want to just moon someone because you think it's a funny practical joke. Well, it's also extremely crude, and insulting, so don't moon someone that you don't wish to be insulted by it. A good thing to remember also, at this point, is to look around. Is there someone you are attracted to nearby? What about family members? If so, it is generally advised to walk away at this point, pants remaining buttoned.;
, This is optional, if you are running short on time. If you don't have time to figure out where you are going to run to, just run for the nearest bush, or, if you are in a city, alley. If you are indoors, run for the door.
 Keep one hand on your fly, so you will be able to pull and zip up your pants again as quickly as possible after mooning. There is nothing more humiliating than attempting to make a moon n' dash- mooning someone, and then running away, than finding out that you are unable to pull up your pants on time. If this is the case, you will fall. With your pants down around your ankles. That is the only possible way that your mooning will actually backfire, making you the "butt" of the joke.
, The time between these two steps should be kept to an absolute minimum. People will be tempted to actually kick you, in the butt, when you moon them. The best way to avoid this is to not give them time. About a second or so of mooning is plenty to make your point.
, If you followed step two, you already had an escape plan prepared at this point. You don't need to stick around and argue- there is no comeback to a mooning, and you should hope that whoever you mooned does not chose to run after you. At this point, you should be trying to put whatever possible between you and the person you mooned.

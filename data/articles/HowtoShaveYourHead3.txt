 There's no need to use expensive shampoo on a shaved head; instead, you can wash your scalp with body soap or a less expensive shampoo. Just make sure it doesn't have drying properties, since your scalp is more sensitive than the rest of your body.
 It's important to continue protect your scalp with a moisturizing lotion, since it is no longer protected from dry air and other elements with a layer of hair.
 Your shaved scalp is susceptible to getting a bad sunburn, especially if this is your first time shaving. Make sure you wear plenty of sunscreen, and wear a hat if the sun is especially strong where you live.
 If you want to maintain your shaved look, it's easiest to shave new hair about once a week. The process will be much faster than it was the first time you shaved.

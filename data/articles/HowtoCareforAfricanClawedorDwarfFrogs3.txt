 Although ACFs (African Clawed Frogs) and ADFs (African Dwarf Frogs) look almost the same when they are small, ACFs will grow very large as they age. As a result, they must be kept in larger tanks, and cannot be kept with small fish or frogs (including ADFs). In short, it is crucial to know if you are dealing with ACF or ADF frogs., Additionally, ACFs have been outlawed in some places. In certain areas, these frogs have gotten into the water supply and gobbled up everything in sight. If you would like to keep ACFs as pets, be sure to research the regulations in your area.For example, ACFs are currently illegal to own in California and Oregon.
 Although the differences in these frogs are subtle (when they are young), there are a few notable characteristics you can look for. The first has to do with the eyes. ACFs will have “buggier” eyes that protrude a bit, while ADFs will have flat eyes that do not stick out. Also, ACFs will have eyes positioned on top of their heads, while ADFs will have eyes on the sides of their faces., Another way to distinguish these types of frogs from one another is to take a look at their claws. ACFs will have claw-like front hands. ADFs, on the other hand, will have dark colored, claw-like back feet. Additionally, ADFs will have webbing between the fingers of all four hands, whereas ACFs will only have webbing on their hind legs.The claws will become more defined as they age, so this is not the easiest way to tell the difference in very young frogs.

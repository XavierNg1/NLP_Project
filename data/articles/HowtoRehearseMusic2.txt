 Set a time when you will rehearse each day. Try to get a routine.


Alternatively you can split your rehearsal time. Whatever task you're doing, you can only do it efficiently for about an hour. Rehearse for a short period and move on with your previous task. Use this method several times a day.
, Just rehearse the first four bars. Then rehearse from the third bar to the sixth bar. If you've rehearse two lines that way, try to play those two lines non-stop. Move on until you've finished the whole piece. Now play the whole piece non-stop.
 Play the score only as fast as you can play it without making any mistakes. This may sound hard at the first time, but you need even more time to correct the mistakes you make over and over again. If you recognize that you're making a mistake, repeat the passage two times in a slower tempo.
 Until now you've learned that you have to repeat very often parts of your music piece in a slowly way when you rehearse. That sounds boring. But boredom is negative when you want to learn something. That's why you should change the way you play after the second repetition. You can try to accelerate the tempo, exaggerate the dynamics, focus on the articulation and much more.
 Put your instrument away. Imagine to play the piece. Try to visualize it as definitely as you can. You should use this technique early - for example when you have to repeat a passage. This method seems strange at the first time, but the results will teach you a different lesson.

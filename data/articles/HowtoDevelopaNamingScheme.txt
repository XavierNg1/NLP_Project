 Replace them with underscores. You can also use the "capitalization technique", where you capitalize the first letter of each word.


Example


Okay: EmpRecord or Emp_Record

Not Okay: Emp Record
You could also go with Emprecord, but that will make it inconvenient to read.

;
,


Example

Okay: EmpRecQ1
Not Okay: EmployeeRecordForQuarterOne



, Please note that /, \, :, *, ?, ", <, > and | cannot be present in a file name. The two most commonly used symbols are ! and _. The others are not advisable.


Example

If you plan on using Emp_Record and EmpRecQ1 very frequently, then rename them as

Okay: _Emp_Record or _EmpRecQ1 or !Emp_Record or !Emp_RecordQ1


Not Okay: Emp_Record_ or Emp_RecQ1!

Please note that Emp_Record_ or Emp_RecQ1! are acceptable as file names but will not serve your purpose of showing up at the top.
Note: For step three to work, you must sort the file names in ascending order.



Example

Continuing with the above example, if you have two employee data files, one for the first quarter and one for the second, name them like this:


Okay: EmpRecQ1 and EmpRecQ2


Not Okay: EmpRecQ1 and EmployeeRecQ2

Please note that Emp_Record_ or Emp_RecQ1! are acceptable as file names but will not serve your purpose of showing up together.

Note: For step four to work, you must sort by filename (ascending or descending, it does not matter).

 Cut a small rectangle or flag shape from ordinary paper and write the dish name on it with a marker. Repeat as many times as needed to create flag guides If you would prefer to print it, follow the next step instead.;
, If you prefer, create a table in Word and type out each dish name in a box on the table. A table with about three columns will create about the right width for the "flag". Print and cut out each box.
 Use a little tape to adhere the tag to each toothpick. Put all the finished tags onto a plate for distributing later when the dishes are laid out.
 Stick the flag guide into the center of each dish. Or, if you do not want it in the food, use tape to attach the flag to the side of the bowl, plate or other dish.

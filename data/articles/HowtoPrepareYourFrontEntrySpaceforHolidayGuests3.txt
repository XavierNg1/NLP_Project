 If you want the outside of your home to make a good impression, your guests must be able to see it! Make sure that all basic outdoor lights are functioning. This helps guests to find your home, and enter it safely.It is also a good idea to make sure your address is visible.
 Another way to help light the path and to give your home a festive feel is to hang holiday lights on the exterior of your home. If this is your first time hanging holiday lights, begin with a basic display. Using a hammer, place nails 6' apart along the front eave of your home. Plug lights into a power source using an extension cord, and use the nails to secure your lights., The outside of your home plays a huge role in the presentation of your entryway and the first impression of your home. You can create a festive feel by decorating your door. Hang a nice wreath or line the edge of your door with garland. You could also wrap the door in holiday-themed gift wrapping paper., Finally, you want your guests to travel into your home with ease. If you have been experiencing inclement weather, you may need to take some additional safety steps. This includes shoveling snow from your walkway, and/or sprinkling salt on any ice.

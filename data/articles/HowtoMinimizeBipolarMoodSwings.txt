Stability during your day can help reduce mood swings. The schedule should include a set sleep time because too little or too much sleep can cause your mood to swing to a manic or depressive state.
 Research has shown that it stabilizes mood and can help prevent depression.



Studies indicate that omega-3 can decrease mood swings in bipolar disorder. Some foods that contain omega-3 include salmon, soybeans, canola oil, pumpkin seeds and walnuts.



These substances can cause changes in chemicals in the brain, leading to manic or depressive episodes.



Situations such as stress at work or home, financial problems, seasonal changes, or lack of sleep are often triggers of a mood swing.



Record how you are feeling, any changes in medication, the amount of sleep you are getting and if you used drugs or alcohol.



Reading through several past logs and comparing them to your recent ones can help you spot early symptoms of mood swings.
Early warning signs of depression can include phrases such as: "people are annoying me" and "I feel like crying all the time." You may also note that you don't feel like doing activities you usually like to do.
Early signs of mania can include phrases such as, "I can't concentrate," "friends told me I'm talking really fast," or "I'm hungry all the time." You may also find records of early mania symptoms such as going on a spontaneous spending spree or doing many different activities at once.



If you notice small manic symptoms, try doing yoga or cut back on activities and sugar. If you notice your mood turning toward depression, attempt to exercise, attend a support group, or get more sunlight.

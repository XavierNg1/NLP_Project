 Keywords capitalize on internet trends, draw visitors, and make your page likelier to come up in searches. Good places to include keywords include the headings, URLs (multiple words should be separated by dashes, ex. “Make-Your-Website-Popular”), and meta-tags.


Use tags and keywords accurately. If search engines detect that you are trying to manipulate your site ranking by using tags and keywords where they don’t actually apply, it will negatively affect your performance. (It won’t go over well with your visitors particularly well, either.)

, The old-fashioned way to do this is by link-swapping – that is, offering to link to someone else if they’ll link to you. Though this can still be very useful when two sites have a good reason to be linked, another approach is to post articles on other sites that link back to yours. These articles need to be informative, engaging, and high-quality. Above all else, they should not look spammy with links that stick out like sore thumbs.


If you are a decent writer, you can do these yourself, but otherwise it may be worth your while to hire someone else to do them. Guest blogs, for example, are a good way to do this.
 In addition to making visitors likelier to come back for more, this lets search engines know your page hasn’t been abandoned or rendered irrelevant.

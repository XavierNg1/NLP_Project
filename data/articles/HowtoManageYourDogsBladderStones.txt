Make a chart with blank date columns and items that the chemical strips test for in the rows. Here you can indicate the readings on the respective dates. Note that doing this should be started long before your dog gets sick. It would be helpful once-a-month, to record a normal history for comparison. As changing levels of glucose (diabetes), ketones (diabetes), pH change (infection), white blood cells (infection), red blood cells (serious infection)all mean something is not right.
 A change from one month to the next is an alert, that should be followed up by another test in a few days, or a week to see if it is an aberration. Heed these alerts to gather information on the web as to what might be happening to your dogs health and get to the vet early and tell him/her that you want to participate in maintaining your dog's health.

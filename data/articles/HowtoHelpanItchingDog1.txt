 If you see your dog scratching constantly, check its skin for dark brown or black specks. If you are not certain if your dog has fleas, comb it gently with a fine tooth comb, getting very close to the skin. Tap the comb onto a white piece of paper and look for fleas., If you suspect that your dog has fleas, bring it to the vet right away. Let the vet examine it to determine the extent of the infestation, and ask for advice on the best way to treat the fleas. Inquire about topical treatments and medications, and whether they will be harmful to you dog's already itchy skin., Follow your veterinarian's advice with regard to flea treatments. Ask about the most common methods for killing fleas on dogs, which include flea powders, sprays, shampoos, topical treatments, or monthly flea tablets. Alternatively, avoid harsh chemicals by topically applying natural ingredients such as lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, rosemary, and lavender oil.
 While your pet receives treatment for fleas, take the necessary steps to rid your home of fleas. Wash all bedding, clothing, and towels, and vacuum carpets and drapes. Wash the floors, and remove dampness in your home (a condition fleas thrive in) by using a dehumidifier.

 Each shelf will be labeled with a binder clip (or possibly two depending upon the size of the shelves) so make sure you have enough and a size that will clip easily to the edge of the shelf.;
, You will need to identify what is on the shelf for easy and quick access. Determine how you would like to label the clip (i.e. terminology such as “paper” or “folders” etc.) and then choose a printing method.

Handwritten: Simply apply a pen to each label for quick labeling. Be sure your handwriting is legible especially if others will be using the shelves.






Inkjet printer: Select the label size on your print software and then create your labels by typing each name in the provided box.
 Peel adhesive label from the label sheet and apply to the back of the binder.
 Make sure the label is visible and clip ends are flush against the bottom of the shelf.

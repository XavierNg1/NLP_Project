 The most common grading scale for schools in the United States is a four point scale. Using this scale, a grade of A = 4 points, B = 3 points, C = 2 points, D = 1 point, and F = 0 points. This is called an unweighted GPA.Some schools use a weighted GPA, which allots 5 points for more rigorous classes, such as honors, Advanced Placement (AP), and International Baccalaureate (IB). Other classes are weighted the same. Students who take the 5-point classes can end up with GPAs above a 4.0.


Some schools use plus and minus grading, which values a plus as +.3 and a minus as -.3. For instance, a B+ is worth 3.3, a B is worth 3.0, and a B- is worth 2.7 points.If youâ€™re unsure what your school uses, try asking your teacher or an administrator.;
, You might also be able to figure out what grades you've received by going back over old report cards or transcripts.


You want to collect the final grades for each of your classes. Individual class grades, midterm grades, or grades on mid-semester report cards do not count. Only final grades for the semester, term, or quarter factor into your GPA.
 Write down the correct point value next to each grade using the four-point scale. So, if you have an A- in a class, record a 3.7; if you have a C+, record a 2.3.


For easy reference, use this chart from the College Board to help assign the correct 4.0-scale value.
 After recording the scores for your grades, add the values up. So, let's say you received an A- in Biology, a B+ in English, and an B- in Economics. You'd add up the totals in the following way: 3.7 + 3.3 + 2.7 = 9.7.
 If you have a value of 9.7 on a 4-point scale for three classes, you will calculate the GPA using the following equation: 9.7 / 3 = 3.2. You have a GPA of 3.2.

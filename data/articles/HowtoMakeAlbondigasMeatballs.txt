Tear 2 slices of white bread into very small bits or make them into breadcrumbs in a food processor.



 


Place the breadcrumbs in a mixing bowl with 8 oz. (225 g) ground beef, 8 oz. (225 g) ground pork, 1 medium onion, 1 garlic clove, 1 tsp. (5 ml) oregano and .5 tsp. (2.5 ml) ground cumin.

Divide the meat mixture into pieces large enough to roll into .5 inch (1.25 cm) balls. You should end up with 35 to 40 albondigas meatballs.






Each meatball should be small enough to be eaten in one bite.
 (10 ml) of olive oil in a 12-inch (30 cm) nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers.


Reduce the heat if the olive oil begins to smoke.


Add half of the meatballs to the olive oil in the pan and cook them, stirring occasionally, until they are well-browned on each side. This should take about 10 minutes.






When they are brown, remove the albondigas meatballs from the frying pan and place them on a large plate lined with paper towels.






Bring the oil back to temperature and add the other half of the albondigas meatballs.






The albondigas meatballs are now ready to be covered with a sauce, added to a soup, or served as they are.

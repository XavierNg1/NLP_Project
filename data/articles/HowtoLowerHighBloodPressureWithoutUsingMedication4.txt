 Many people have a temporary rise in blood pressure when under stress. If you have high blood pressure because you are overweight or have a family history of hypertension, then stress raises it that much more. This is because your adrenal gland releases stress hormones which tend to cause your cardiovascular system to overwork.


If you are under chronic stress where you produce that stress hormone every day, then your cardiovascular system will naturally go into a state where it is overworking. This occurs due to the fact that the stress hormone increases your pulse, respiration and heart rate, as in preparation for "flight or fight". Your body thinks you are in need of fighting or running and naturally gets your body ready for either one. After prolonged stress, imagine what kind of work the heart is placed under. So try some relaxation techniques:
Try taking a long walk to take the edge off a stressful day long before bedtime. Make time for decompressing each and every day.
Set aside around 30 minutes before bed to finish the dayâ€™s must-do tasks (10 minutes). Do the personal hygiene things (10 minutes). Create calm-down time; try deep breathing and/or meditation (10 minutes).
 Simply observing and slowing the respiration rate produces a significant reduction in blood pressure.
 Do this until you fall asleep for instance or in break time for 5, 10 or 15 minutes occasionally throughout the day.
 Taking a hot bath just prior to bedtime can help the body retain lower blood pressure for hours or even the entire night.

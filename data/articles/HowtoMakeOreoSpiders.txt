 Put the cookies in a microwave-safe bowl for about ten to fifteen seconds. This will soften up their creamy white innards. If you have a powerful microwave, check after about eight secondsâ€”you don't want a meltdown, just a softening.;
, Un-string the Twizzlers by taking each "twist" and peeling it into single strands.
 Cut the Twizzler strings into 1-inch (2.5cm) pieces. For daddy long-legs, go for a full 2 inches.
 Stick four Twizzle-legs into each side of the Oreo to make spider's legs. If you really love Twizzlers, you can stick in more, and just call it a mutant spider!

, Use a toothpick to put two dabs of honey on the Oreo where you want the eyes to be, and then stick the M&M's on to these dots. Alternately, you can dab the M&Ms with the honey, and stick where desired. Orange M&Ms would be very good for Halloween.
 Serve them as a snack or dessert, yummy! If using as a Halloween snack, arrange on a platter with other "scary food" to make it into a Halloween feast.

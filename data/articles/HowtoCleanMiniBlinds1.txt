 Close your blinds. Using the vacuum brush attachment or a Dustbuster, gently vacuum one side of your blinds. Open your blinds all the way, so the opposite side of the blinds are facing you. Now vacuum the other side.You can vacuum blinds made from any material.;
, Avoid using a feather duster, which will just push the dust into the air. Instead, use a microfiber cloth, rag, or even an old sock. Hold them securely in one hand and with the other, gently grasp each blind and rub the cloth along the front and back of the blind.Dust them every week or two to keep them clean.
 Combine equal parts warm water and vinegar in a bowl. Wet a rag, sock, or microfiber cloth in the vinegar and water solution and wring it out. Gently squeeze each blind between the cloth in your other hand, wiping the front and back simultaneously. You can also put the sock on your hand and rub each slat between your thumb and fingers.This works with metal, plastic, faux and real wood blinds.
Avoid getting wooden blinds too wet and dry them gently with a clean towel if they are damp after cleaning.

 When the other team assembles along the line of scrimmage to snap the ball, place your own players so that each of the other team’s receivers will be covered once the ball is snapped. Place them as you see fit, since the defensive team is not obligated to place any players directly on the line of scrimmage. However, be sure to follow these rules:Do not place a player directly across from your opponent’s center at the line of scrimmage.
Wait until the ball is snapped before crossing the neutral zone.
 Turn your defense into an offense at any given opportunity. If possible, try to catch any passes thrown by your opponents and make a run for your end zone. If your opponents drop the ball without going “down,” try to recover it to claim possession for your team.


If you and your opponent catch the ball at the exact same time, the ball is still theirs.Do not physically interfere with an offensive player to prevent them from catching a ball. This will result in a ten-yard penalty., Instead of tackling your opponents, rip one of their flags from their belt or waistband once they catch the ball. If one or more of their flags have come off accidentally, use your hand to touch them anywhere between their shoulders and their knees..


If your opponent has all of his flags, refrain from touching their body at all. Doing so will automatically grant them an extra ten yards as a penalty against you.As soon as you have hold of their flag, raise it in the air so others see that you have it.
 Remember that flag football is a much gentler variation on traditional football. Expect roughhousing to be penalized. Avoid physical contact with your opponents, except for their flags. Refrain from:Physically forcing your opponent out of bounds.
Tackling them or trying to injure them with your arms or legs.

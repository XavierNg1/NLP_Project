 A v-pose is a classic pose to use with you and your prom date. To do a v-pose, stand close together and hold hands. You can turn towards each other while keeping about three fourths of your body facing the camera. If you don't want to hold hands, and one of you is wearing a lapel, one person can place their hands on the other's lapel.This is a great pose to use when taking your own photos at home. You can also use it when being photographed during prom if your prom takes photographs at the dance.
 Cupped hands often look awkward in hand holding. This can make your hands look small and stubby. Instead, lace your fingers together when holding hands in photos., Do not stick to strictly couple photos. Get a couple of photos with the entire group together. If your family members are seeing you off to prom, get some photos with your family. You may come to treasure a photo of you and your parents taken on prom night.Group photos do not have to be fancy. You can simply all line up along a wall and smile.
If there are a lot of people, you can stand in rows. The taller people can be in back so you can see them better in the picture.
 If there are couples going to prom, individual couple photos are also fun. Make sure everyone who wants a couples photo gets one. Stick to simple poses, such as having couples hold hands or put their arms around one another. Elaborate poses may end up looking forced or awkward., A great trick for a natural smile is to look down at the ground, then look up and smile just as the photo is being taken. The angle will make your eyes and smile look bigger and more genuine.You can also think of something that makes you laugh while a photo is being taken.
If you want your teeth to look whiter for prom photos, use whitening strips in the weeks leading up to getting your photos taken.

 If your gerbil displays abnormal behavior with their seizures, you should take them to the vet. Seizures are common in gerbils. However, seizures that last longer than one to two minutes or that occur frequently or in clusters may indicate a more serious condition.The vet will perform an exam based any outward symptoms. They will rule out other conditions that may be related to epilepsy. You will be asked to give a medical history about your gerbil, detailing symptoms during a seizure, their frequency, and when they started.
 For most gerbils who experience seizures, no treatment is needed. The seizures wonâ€™t cause damage and they taper off after six months of age. However, if your gerbil has severe seizures which cause intense, frequent, or damaging seizures, then they may need medication.Your vet may prescribe a muscle relaxant to help control the intensity and frequency of severe seizures.
 Gerbils can have two different types of seizures. A mild seizure may cause the gerbil to be catatonic. They may lay unmoving on the ground with their ears or nose twitching. The gerbil may be limp when picked up.


Severe, or grand mal, seizures result in convulsions and rigid muscles. These are usually very short, around 30 seconds.
 Seizures are a common condition in gerbils. They afflict 20 to 40% of gerbils starting around age two months. Seizures continue until around six months of age. As the gerbil ages, the seizures become less frequent.

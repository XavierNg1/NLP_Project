 Whether she’s frustrated, embarrassed or angry, let your daughter know her feelings matter too.

Don’t roll your eyes or tell her she’s overreacting. For example, respond by saying, “I hear what you’re saying. It sounds like you’re really angry with your friends. That must be difficult.”
If you’re in a heated discussion or just having a serious conversation, always give her the opportunity to speak. Don’t just brush off what she says. Make eye contact, nod while she’s speaking and really listen.
Repeat back what your teen said so that she knows you have listened to and acknowledged her feelings.
 One of the best ways to validate your daughter’s feelings is to show your support with a hug. Sometimes your teen doesn’t want to talk. Sometimes she’s simply needs your affection and attention.


If your daughter is really upset you may want to say, “It sounds like you’re going through a tough time. Can I give you a hug?”
A hug can be a good resolution to an argument as well. Take a few minutes to cool off, then approach your daughter and summarize what her side of the argument was. Ask her for a hug afterwards to show that you love and support her.
 You may think she's too young to experience such issues, but if your teen mentions she’s depressed or suicidal, acknowledge what she’s saying and act on it.


One in five teenagers are diagnosed with mental health issues, so it’s important to acknowledge her feelings.Although occasional moodiness or bouts of sadness is fairly normal for teenagers, take note if she's withdrawing from friends and family or suddenly has lost interest in all of her favorite activities.Be supportive and let her know she's loved and that this issue is worth your time and attention.
Show that you’ve acknowledged her feelings by scheduling an appointment with a mental health professional. Go with her to the appointment, take notes and ask questions about treatment plans.

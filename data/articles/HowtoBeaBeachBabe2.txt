 Whether you’re naturally outgoing or a quieter type, bring out your best flirty side and down-for-anything attitude. Go to the beach with good friends so you’re more comfortable. Try flirting with a surfer by talking to them about how long they’ve been surfing (and ask if they can teach you!), or chat with a lifeguard about the surf.


If you have a more reserved personality, just chill out solo by laying out to tan on a towel or chair while listening to music or reading a book or magazine. Quiet and mysterious can make for a beach babe attitude too!
Be easy and go with the flow! Just walk away from friends who are engaged in an argument or other drama, and easily accept when there’s a change of plans or new idea in your group. Beach babe attitude is all about being laid back and carefree!

, Play beach volleyball, toss a frisbee, or skateboard on the boardwalk. Learn to surf, boogie board, or swim in the ocean.

Join in with a group of beachgoers and ask them what they do for fun around the shore.

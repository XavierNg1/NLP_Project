 Once you have chosen that animal you will probably use it for most adventures; as this will be your main 'adventure animal' so choose wisely. You can always change the look and other things of your animal, but you can't transfer xp from one animal to another. (Note: You don't have to have an Adventure Animal, but it is recommended if you want to quickly reach the higher levels.);
, This will run you through the basics and immediately make you level 1. It will not make you level 2 the next time you do it, Level 3 the next, etc. So don't go doing it a bunch of times. It won't help.
, Most adventures are under Level 4, so try to be Level 4 at least.
 Try hard more high level adventures for faster progress!

, soon you will be Level 5 or so, and get a star instead of a circle! As you progress, the shape of your level thing will change.
 Lots of people will ask you how you became such a high level.

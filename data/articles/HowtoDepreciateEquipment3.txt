 This method is an accelerated depreciation method. Instead of spreading the cost of the asset evenly over the course of its useful life, a higher rate of depreciation is recorded in the beginning, and the rate of depreciation declines over time. This method would be used for equipment that is used more in the early years of its life.The idea is that the equipment generates more revenue in the early years of its life than in later years as it becomes less productive. Therefore it is more accurate to record more of the expense through depreciation earlier and less later on as the equipment’s productivity declines.
 In this method, the straight-line depreciation rate is doubled in order to calculate the accelerated depreciation. The accelerated depreciation rate is applied to the book value, or remaining carrying value, to determine the depreciation amount of the asset each year.For example, if a straight-line depreciation rate for an asset is 20 percent, then the accountant would use double that amount, or 40 percent, for the double declining balance depreciation method.
 First, calculate the straight-line depreciation rate using the cost, salvage value and useful life of the asset. In the first year, apply the double depreciation rate to the cost of the asset to calculate the depreciation expense. In the second year and for all the years following, apply the double depreciation rate to the book value (cost – depreciated amount) of the asset.Using the same example as above, suppose a company purchased a vehicle for $60,000 and the vehicle has a $10,000 salvage value and a five-year useful life.
Calculate the straight line depreciation rate with the equation 1/5 = .2.
Double the depreciation rate with the equation .2 x 2 = .4. The double depreciation rate is 40 percent.
Calculate deprecation for the first year with the equation $60,000 x .4 = $24,000. This is the amount of depreciation that will be recorded in year one.
Calculate the book value by subtracting the amount of depreciation already recorded from the original cost. Use the equation $60,000 - $24,000 = $36,000. This is the amount of the equipment that hasn’t been depreciated.
Calculate the depreciation amount for year two by multiplying the book value by the accelerated depreciation rate. Use the equation $36,000 x .4 = $14,400. This is the amount of depreciation that will be recorded in year two.
Calculate the remaining book value using the equation $60,000 - $24,000 - $14,400 = $21,600. This is the amount that remains to be depreciated.
Calculate depreciation for year three by multiplying the book value by the accelerated depreciation rate. Use the equation $21,600 x .4 = $8,640. This is the amount of depreciation that has to be recorded in year three.
Calculate the remaining book value using the equation $60,000 - $24,000 - $14,400 - $8,640 = $12,960.
Calculate depreciation for year four by multiplying the book value by the accelerated depreciation rate. Use the equation $12,960 x .4 = $5,184.
Adjust the depreciation for year four for the salvage value. Remember that the equipment has a salvage value of $10,000. If you applied the entire depreciation amount of $5,184 to the book value, it would leave you with $7,776, which is less than the salvage value.
You can only record depreciation up to the amount where the book value equals the salvage value. Therefore the year four deprecation value must be calculated by subtracting the salvage value from the book value using the equation $12,960 – $10,000 = $2,960.

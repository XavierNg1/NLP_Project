 You can petsit, babysit, tutor, or do yard work for family friends and neighbors. You may not be suited for all that work, so narrow down what you want to do. Even though you may not want to work, remember how much you want that American Girl Doll! In the end it will be worth it.
 You can't find work without people to work for. Knock on your neighbors' doors and ask family friends if they have any work they need done. Be sure to sell yourself as a responsible and hard-working kid.


Have a rate in mind, but wait to talk about it. If you do good work, they'll pay you a fair price.
Be respectful. Not everybody wants work done. If they don't want to hire you, don't press the issue.
Ask your parents before starting, and let them know where you are at all times.
 Make sure they're in an area where people will see it, like a bulletin board or on a busy street corner. Put your phone number, name, and the work you want to do. Then wait for somebody to call you!


Make slips with your number on it so people can take your information on the go.
Make your flyer colorful and visually appealing. Pictures and big, bold fonts are good. Convey as much information in as few words as possible.
 If you get a job, do your best work. The better your work, the more they'll pay you and the more likely they are to ask for you again. Hopefully word will spread and soon enough everybody will be asking for you!

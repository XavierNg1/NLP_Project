 Women enjoy facial hair in general but especially in the form of slightly grown out scruff. Instead of growing a full beard, do not shave for a few days so you have a bit of stubble. Studies indicate this is the type of facial hair women tend to find most attractive., Some studies indicate that red makes people think of sex and sexuality. Adding a little red to your wardrobe may make women feel slightly more attracted to you. Some studies indicate women associate the color red with success and social status as well, both of which might make you appear more attractive in their eyes., Biologically speaking, sexual attraction is rooted in who would make the best mate. Men with a stronger physique may appear healthier to some women. Women also associate strength with protective, dominant men, which many women find attractive. Spend some time at the gym weight lifting and try to get more protein in your diet to promote strength training., A few studies indicate women prefer older men. This is due in part to the increase in independence and financial security that tends to come with age. Many women prefer men who are confident and have their lives together, and this kind of self assuredness is typical in older men. Try to select wardrobe choices typical of older, professional men, like suits and ties, over more casual wear. You may also want to consider trimming your hair in a short, conservative style as this can also make you appear older., Women tend to be more attracted to men who are clean and take care of themselves. Make sure your breath is fresh by chewing gum or using a breath strip after smoking, drinking coffee, or drinking alcohol. Keep your hair brushed and get regular haircuts. Check your teeth to make sure nothing is stuck between before going out on a date or to a place where you're looking to meet women.

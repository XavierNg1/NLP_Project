 Don't mistake power drain for the bubble shield, don't think tapping RT fires the spartan laser, get to know your weapons first.;
, If you have some armor, pretty much everyone has it. Most of the time someone on the field will be wearing hayabusa, so don't brag.
 This means you can fire a sniper rifle or a plasma grenade and hit. If you can't fire a sniper rifle, either take it some place people don't think of or give it to a teammate.
 Don't play Halo 3 as if it were Halo 2.
 You need this tool to find people who are getting ready to ambush you. Spot them first to avoid looking foolish.
 Know the good spots to be, where the best stuff is, and where ambushes may come from. If you get really used to it, start making ambushes of your own.
 This means paying attention to what your teammates are doing so that you can help, or at least avoid hurting them. Of course, never intentionally kill your teammates.
 Don't try to think you can escape through there. You have a chance of surviving on a thrusting ghost, but it's better not to try it.
 There are ways to die even when you are using it.
 You need to conspire with teammates if you want to win. Matchmaking doubles need headphones to win.
 If you run away people will think you're new and call you noob. Always fight, even if you don't think you can win.
 It's team for a reason.
 It's noobish, will make the person angry at you, and wastes time. You'll pretty much die if they respawn next to you.
 Don't waste time trying to get a mega weapon that you cannot even use well.
 Someone has taken it, or they will be waiting for you to come back and kill you again.
 Making excuses is poor sportsmanship. Accept that you're dead - and get revenge.
 You can always have revenge.
 You should never use the same gun every single time. People will call you a noob for doing this. Why do you think they have other guns.
 There is no point at hiding all the time. The more times you hide the more times you will be called a noob.

 If you are an aggressive sniper, try using the USR. The reason being is that you can get more feeds and/or kill more enemies faster.;
, An aggressive sniper should use extended mags because you are most likely going to be engaging a large amount of enemies before you have the time to reload. You should also use chrome lined because it will enable you to get one shot kills easily thus letting you stay alive longer.
 As for perks you will need Ready Up, Sleight of Hand, and Fully Loaded. The rest of the perks are up to you.

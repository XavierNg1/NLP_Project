 It doesn't matter who does it whether it be your pastor, his/her youth pastor, or even you! A discipleship can greatly help him/her really know God. It can also teach Him/Her how to learn more about God and how to live for Him.;
, There he/she can discuss any question he/she has about living for God. It's also a great way to make new friends.
 Those who hang around with wise people will become wise themselves. If you notice that the friends they hang out with are making bad choices and influencing him/her in a negative way, talk to him/her about it and make sure they get new and better friends.
 When they are surrounded by Christian friends and away from the influence of the media and society, they can really grow. Mission trips and Summer Camps are a great way to grow in Christ

 If your aligner is not fitting well or there are air gaps between your teeth and the tray, try biting down on chewies. Chewies are small cylindrical cushions made of a plastic-like material; when used regularly they help your aligner conform to the shape of your mouth and get rid of any gaps that might exist. Bite down on chewies a few times a day for 5-10 minutes at a time. You can obtain chewies through your orthodontist or you can order them online.You can also try doing this with cotton balls, but make sure the tray is properly fit on the correct position

, Each aligner starts out “ill-fitting” on purpose. It is designed to fit the shape of your teeth after you have finished wearing it correctly for two weeks, so when you first put it in it might feel a little snug or a little tight.If worn correctly (20-22 hours a day) the tray should sink down and settle in. By the end of the two weeks of wearing them correctly, your tray should conform perfectly to the shape of your mouth. If not, continue to wear the existing tray a few more days until you are able to see your dentist, he/she might have to do a mid-course correction., Your dentist is the best expert on the fit of your invisalign alignment trays; he/she should be your first contact in getting back on your course of treatment if you have not worn invisalign for a while. Be honest; in most cases your dentist will be able to tell if you have not worn your aligner trays as much as you claim (Invisalign Teen has a built in “lie-detector” – each aligner contains a blue indicator dot that fades over time when used as directed).

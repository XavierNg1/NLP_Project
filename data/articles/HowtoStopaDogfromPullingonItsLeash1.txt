 Be sure that your dog has a comfortable collar that fits it properly. The collar shouldn’t be so tight that it is choking the dog, but should be tight enough so that it does not slide up and down the dog’s neck.You should be able to slide your hand between the dog’s neck and collar when it is secured in place.
Many people choose to use a harness instead of a collar. The harness disperses the pressure to the dog's back rather than its neck. This will allow you to train your dog to walk on a leash without having to rely on the choking feeling the dog gets when pulling at its leash.;
, When using this method for training your dog not to pull, make sure you do not use a retractable leash. This will defeat the entire purpose of the exercise. Use a standard chain or cloth leash., Whenever your dog pulls, stop and stand still (be a tree). No matter how hard your dog pulls, don't let it go in the direction it wants to go. The reason for this is that if the dog pulls, and you follow it, the dog is learning that pulling is a very effective way to get somewhere.It might help to attach the leash to your belt loop using a carabiner. This prevents the dog from getting ahead. It's also far easier to stand still with your hips getting pulled than your arm.
 Wait until the dog does anything that loosens the leash. The dog might stop pulling by leaning back, sitting, or changing direction. As soon as the leash loosens, you can start walking again.You can encourage the dog to loosen the leash by calling it back to you.
 This method requires a lot of patience! You're trying to teach the dog that pulling gets it nowhere. You have to be consistent and timely.A variation of this method is to walk in the opposite direction whenever your dog pulls.

 The Apple Watch and iPhone must be connected via Bluetooth or to the same Wi-Fi network.
 This brings up the Glances menu.
 This button is located below the Airplane Mode, Do Not Disturb and Silent Mode buttons. After tapping on the ping button, your iPhone will emit a brief pinging sound to help you locate the device, even if silent mode is enabled.



Tap and hold the ping button to have your iPhone flash its LED light. This can be helpful when trying to locate your iPhone at nighttime or in the dark.

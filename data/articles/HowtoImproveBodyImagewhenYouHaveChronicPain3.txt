 Generally speaking, those who spend less time monitoring their body to see if it conforms to current standards generally have a more positive body image. Avoid spending too much time in front of the mirror or on the scale while you are trying to improve your body image.Make pain management a priority over appearance every day. The better you feel about your body’s ability to cope with your pains, the better you will feel about your body overall.
You do not need to avoid things like mirrors or scales entirely. Rather, use them only when necessary. Use a mirror to fix your hair, for example, but don’t spend minutes or hours staring into it afterward.
 Finding a support group for people with the same or similar types of chronic conditions can not only help you feel supported, but also provide you with tips and techniques that have worked for others. Look online or talk to your doctor about finding a support group in your area for people with chronic pain.Support group meetings will focus on a number of issues, from pain management to work and personal life, as well as body image. Be ready to discuss a wealth of issues pertaining to your daily life.
Remember that you are there to offer support as well as receive it. Be calm and patient, and offer others your respect and attention when it is their turn to speak.
 If your chronic pain is severely impacting the ways in which you perceive your body, let your doctor know. They may be able to recommend alternative treatments such as therapy or meditation, as well work on adjusting any medication that may have negative mental side effects.Let your doctor know what you are thinking in as much detail as possible. Instead of telling them, “I feel bad about my body,” let them know, “My leg pain makes me feel like others are staring at me and mocking me because I have to walk slow.”

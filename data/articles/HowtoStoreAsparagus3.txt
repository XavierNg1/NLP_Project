 Overcooked asparagus becomes mushy, and if you try to reheat it after storing it will be pretty much inedible. If you want to store your cooked asparagus, make sure it still has some bite left after cooking.



Blanching or steaming asparagus is a great way to bring out its flavor while retaining its crisp texture.
Sauteed and roasted asparagus also hold up well to storage if they aren't overcooked.
Boiling asparagus often results in a mushy texture, so avoid this method.
 Cooked asparagus will last the longest if you store it in a container with as little air as possible. A plastic or glass food storage container with a tight-fitting lid is best.
 Cooked asparagus is best within a few days of storing it. After that, it begins to lose its bright taste and firm texture.

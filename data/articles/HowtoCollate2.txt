 Collating digital documents usually requires merging PDF documents. You can purchase and download Adobe Acrobat, which is the industry standard, or you can download a free program, like PDFBinder.


Always make sure you are downloading programs from a trusted site. Adobe and CNET are good locations to get reviews and download software programs.
 Double click on it in your Downloads folder. Let the installation wizard prompt you to finish installation.
 This means you may have to scan double-sided documents and save them with a page number. It may also mean gathering PDFs from different sources and placing them in a logical order for the multi-page PDF you create.
 Either drag and drop the PDFs into the program or choose the option to create and combine files., Most multi-page PDF creators allow you to move the order up and down until it is perfected.
 Save the multi-page PDF under one name in an easy-to-access location., Make sure it is collated in the right order. Send or print as required.

It may need antibiotics every so often to prevent stomatitis from returning.You'll need to work closely with the vet to create an antibiotic schedule for your cat.

You'll also have to manage the condition once your cat stops taking the antibiotics since stomatitis can flare up again.;
, The vet may prescribe steroids that you give to your cat via the mouth or through injection. The vet will determine the dose and the treatment schedule depending on your cat's particular situation. The steroids should reduce the symptoms your cat is experiencing.To reduce side effects from the steroids, ask the vet about using a low-dose of oral steroids, which are less risky than steroid injections.
 Some cats develop a serious reaction to the inflamed tissue. If your cat doesn't respond to most treatment, the vet may recommend suppressing your cat's immune system so it stops attacking your cat's own body.

Ask the vet about chlorhexidine gluconate rinses or gels. The vet may also recommend applying anti-inflammatory medications that can make your cat more comfortable.Your cat might struggle while you try to administer the oral antiseptic rinse, which is why they aren't prescribed as often as other treatments.

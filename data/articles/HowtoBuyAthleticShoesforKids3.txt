 Soccer shoes, or cleats, should allow your child to run, change direction, and kick easily.

Indoor soccer shoes should be flat and made with a non-marking rubber sole.






Outdoor soccer shoes should provide traction on grassy surfaces.
 Running shoes need to have extra cushioning to promote forward movement, such as running and walking, as well as to prevent sprains, shin splints, and stress fractures. Shoes differ from basic running activities to long-distance running, depending on your childâ€™s sports preference. Look for:


A shock-absorbing sole
A supportive arch
Firm heel support
A reasonably flexible forefoot

, This gum rubber sole helps kids to keep from sliding around on the gym floor. A slip could lead to a sprained ankle.
 Tennis shoes should be flatter and sturdier than other shoes to allow kids to move from side to side more efficiently. At the same time, they need to provide stability and flexibility for moving forward and backward.


Keep in mind that you should select the tennis shoe based on the surface your child will be playing on, be it hard court, grass, or clay. There are some shoes designed to handle any surface.
 Look for shoes that cushion and stabilize to help your child jump, and land well, when needed.

 Using a protective plastic bag will keep your comics from being exposed to atmospheric pollutants such as dust and harmful gases. Bags are available for most comic book sizes and in materials such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or Mylar. Polyethylene and polypropylene bags are designed to last for 3 to 5 years, after which time they should be replaced, while Mylar bags are designed to last for longer periods. Whichever type of plastic bag you use, be sure to buy bags that are acid-free to prevent damage to the comic inside.
 Backing boards help keep your comics flat in the bag. As with bags, choose boards that are acid-free and insert them in the bag with the comic slowly, with the shiny side facing the comic book. Backing boards should be replaced every 3 to 5 years to remove any contaminants that may have gathered while the comics were in storage.
 You can use either a regular tape or double-sided tape, provided it is acid-free.
 After bagging your comics, place them upright in a protective box. The best boxes to use are acid-free cardboard boxes made for the purpose.
 A "safe place" means not just safe from prying eyes, but also somewhere safe from environmental damage. Store your comics somewhere cool, dry, and dark, away from both sunlight and fluorescent light. A closet on the main level is best, with a dry basement a good second, but an attic subject to temperature and humidity fluctuations throughout the year is the worst storage location.


Keep the storage box at least 5 to 10 inches (12.5 to 25 cm) off the floor, with space around it to allow air to circulate and prevent the growth of molds and fungi.
 Even with the best storage, it's still possible for comics to get damaged. The surest way to prevent lasting damage is by checking your comics over every so often.


When handling comics, use cotton gloves if possible as if you were handling historic documents in an archive, as in a sense, you are.

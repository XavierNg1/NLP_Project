 Caffeine increases the number of calories you burn by a small amount, but it may also make you feel like moving more. Drinking a caffeinated beverage with a meal like black tea, green tea, or coffee may increase your metabolic rate by as much as 10%.



Green tea seems to have even more calorie burning properties and it may even block your absorption of carbohydrates.Keep in mind that drinking coffee or tea plain will take some getting used to, but purchasing high-quality beans or tea leaves will certainly help.
 Drinking water helps your body burn more calories. One study found that drinking eight cups of water per day helps your body burn about 100 extra calories per day. Consider getting yourself a reusable water bottle to help keep track of how much water you are drinking every day., Your body needs adequate rest each night in order to function properly and burn calories. In addition, being sleep deprived makes it harder for you to do other things that help your body burn calories, like eating well and exercising. Make sure that you sleep for seven to nine hours every night to keep your body burning calories and functioning at its best.

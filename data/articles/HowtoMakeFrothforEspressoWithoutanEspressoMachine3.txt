 Whichever glass or mug you use, donâ€™t fill it more than half full with milk, and make sure the glass or mug is microwave-safe. Use 2% or nonfat milk for best results.
 Locate a small electric or battery-powered milk frother that you can hold inside your glass of milk. Place your milk frother into the milk so that the whisk end is submerged in the milk before turning it on.
 Switch the milk frother on and gently move it up and down in the milk for about 30 seconds until the milk appears frothy and approximately double the volume.
 Put your glass or mug with the frothed milk into the microwave and heat for 30 to 45 seconds.
 Add your espresso straight to your mug of frothed milk foam, or pour the milk foam over another cup with espresso, using a spoon to hold back the foam and let the liquid milk pour it, then spooning the foam on top.For a cappuccino, use about the same amount of warm liquid milk as milk foam to add to your espresso. For a latte, use about twice the amount of liquid milk as milk foam. To achieve this, you may need to warm up more milk in the microwave to get the right amount.,

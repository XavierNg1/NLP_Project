 Make an appointment with your doctor to discuss exercise and physical therapy. PT is a treatment that is often prescribed by your doctor and covered by insurance. Discuss your current pain and mobility problems and create a general exercise plan.Choose a physical therapist that specializes in treating people with your type of arthritis.
You may find that a therapist is used to treating people with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or elderly or younger patients.
They may also specialize in a specific anatomical area, such as the knees or back.
 Go through an evaluation with your physical therapist before you get started with exercises or other therapies. The physical therapist will test muscle strength, mobility, pain, and body mechanics. Ask your physical therapist to write down a plan based on the results.Ask your physical therapist if weight loss would possibly ease your symptoms. If you are overweight and have arthritis in your ankles, knees, back and shoulders, then weight loss should be one of your primary physical therapy goals.
 Plan to visit the physical therapist twice per week for a few months. Regular meetings can help to relieve more symptoms of arthritis and mobility issues than occasional sessions.In many cases, patients need to increase their muscle mass, which can only be done with regular exercise.
 Before beginning to exercise, the therapist will make sure that you can get out of bed, get up from a chair, and walk without putting undue pressure on your joints. The therapist will teach you how to change your body mechanics, if you do not do things properly.Use aides as prescribed by your physical therapist. If you are unable to perform regular day-to-day motions without increasing the stress on your joints, you may be prescribed a cane, walker, sock gripper, shower stool, or other device. Use them as directed, and you may notice a gradual decrease in your pain.

 One of the most vital parts of a relationship is openness.Don't hide who you really are or what you want out of the future you two may have together. By creating this understanding upfront, you are laying a solid foundation.


Set expectations right away about what you want whether it be a friendship, casual relationship or long-term commitment.
 You could end up self-sabotaging your efforts by calling too much or texting too often. Try to consider things from his perspective. Remember that everyone moves at their own pace and should be given room to do so without any pressures.


This includes giving him the benefit of the doubt in a situation. For example, if he says that he's too busy to hang, simply ask when a better time would be.
 This is one of the best parts of starting something new. Ask a lot of questions, even the silly ones. This will help to further break the ice and get everyone relaxed. You can ask about his first job, a food he can't live without, who his oldest friend is or what peeves him.


Be ready to share as well. It's only fair.
 Make note of different things he does that make you happy or put a smile on your face and let him know. Acknowledging even the smallest things will encourage him to keep it up. If he feels he's a positive part of your life, he'll want to stay engaged in the relationship.You can show him appreciation by telling him, " That really meant a lot to me. Thank you," or by reciprocating with deeds.

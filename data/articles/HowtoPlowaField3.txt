 Most modern tillers come in one of two varieties: "front-line" (driven by the front wheels) and "rear-line" (driven by the rear wheels). Both will work for gardens and small fields, but if you have the choice, pick the type that's most appropriate. See below:



Front-line tillers are typically easier to use and better for smaller gardening situations. They handle like a power lawnmower and, with a little care, can be used in tight spaces without damaging plants or property on either side.

Rear-line tillers are a little harder to use but are better for bigger plowing jobs. They are bulkier and don't allow for as precise of turns, so they should be used away from plants and property you want to protect.
 Almost all mechanical tillers allow you to adjust these settings with controls on the unit. As a general rule, harder, compacted soils require slower, shallower plowing. Tilling too deep or too fast in this soil can overwork the motor. For established beds, you can use deeper, faster tilling.
 Position the tiller in the corner of your field where you plan on starting. Start the tiller with the starting mechanism. This can vary from unit to unit but is often similar to the type of mechanism you might expect on a lawn mower. Use the tiller's controls to slowly work your way down the plot in a straight line, turning around and doubling back at the end.


Some tillers have a safety switch that prevents starting. If you can't get the tiller started, check for one of these.
 Be prepared to go over your work a second time with the tiller. Any clods of dirt should be broken into roughly dime-sized pieces or smaller. When you're finished, your plot should be tilled into a series of loose furrows so that water can drain to the edges.

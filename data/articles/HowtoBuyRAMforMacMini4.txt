 Shopping for RAM online may provide you with a variety of options in terms of pricing, return policies, or warranties.


Enter search criteria into any Internet search engine, such as "RAM Mac Mini" or "buy RAM for 2010 Mac Mini." The search results will provide you with numerous websites or retailers that sell RAM compatible with the Mac Mini.
Visit the websites of major retailers such as Walmart or Amazon. You may receive discounts on your entire purchase or discounts for shipping and handling from sites such as these.
You may buy RAM from auction websites such as eBay; however, you may want to review the feedback and ratings for each specific seller to avoid purchasing RAM that is falsely advertised, faulty, or incompatible with your Mac Mini.
 The benefit to buying RAM from a nearby retail store is that you can take it home and install the RAM immediately into your Mac Mini.


Visit retail stores that specialize in electronics, computers, or Apple products; such as Best Buy or Comp USA.

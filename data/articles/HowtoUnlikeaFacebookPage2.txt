 Your Activity Log is the easiest way to see all of your pages listed in one place. Click the Privacy menu icon next to the Gear icon at the top-right of your Facebook page.Click “See More Settings”.
Click the “Use Activity Log” link in the “Who can see my stuff?” section.
You can also access the Activity Log by opening your profile and clicking the Activity Log button.
 The menu will expand and give you two options: “Pages and Interests” and “Posts and Comments”. Click the “Pages and Interests” option.


If these options do not appear when you click the “Likes” button, try refreshing the page in your browser.
 In the main frame, you will see a chronological list of all the pages you have liked. Scroll down to see all of the pages.
 Select Unlike from the menu that appears. Facebook will ask to confirm that you want to unlike the page. Once the page is unliked, you will no longer see updates from that page on your Newsfeed.

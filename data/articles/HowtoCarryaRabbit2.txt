 Look for a carrying case made out of plastic, with ventilation holes to prevent overheating, and a firmly attached handle.. The plastic should be thick enough to be chew-proof, and the access and ventilation areas should be made of strong wire.Your carrier should be large enough for your rabbit to sit up straight and lay down comfortably inside, but small enough to make your rabbit feel secure, and prevent it from sliding or rolling around during transport. If your rabbit is large and you need a big carrier, consider choosing a model with wheels or a shoulder strap to move it more easily.
 A nervous rabbit is likely to urinate in its carrier, so line the inside surface with paper towels or hay before placing it inside. Hay might also serve as something for your uneasy rabbit to nibble on to calm its nerves. Place enough hay or paper towels inside to absorb urine so that it doesn’t gather on your pet’s coat., Before you use the carrier, leave it out in the open inside your rabbit’s home enclosure for it to explore on its own. Getting familiar with the carrier will reduce your rabbit’s anxiety about it later on. Place it on the ground with the door open, and leave snacks inside., Never push or force your rabbit into its carrier. Entice it to enter with snacks or toys, and gentle encouragement. Always give yourself enough time to be patient about the process before transporting your rabbit to an appointment.Once your rabbit is in the carrier, be as quiet and gentle as possible about locking the door behind them.
 Do your best to keep your rabbit cool and comfortable during transport. Avoid travelling during the warmest point of the day. Make sure that your rabbit has access to water during the trip.

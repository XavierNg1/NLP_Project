 This is very effective if you've already bound your chest. It is also an alternative if you don't have anything to bind with. A tight t-shirt or tank top under some loose shirts or a button up can make your chest look smaller. You can further enhance the illusion of a smaller chest area by:

Wear patterns or colours that distract the eye from your chest. Shirts with regular patterns (like plaid) can emphasize the fact that there's something underneath, whereas irregular patterns, like camouflage, will break up outlines and make them harder to see. Depending on the shirt, shirts with a logo right across your chest may make your bust more or less noticeable. Details that cover the entire shirt are stiff and will make your front appear flatter. Darker colored shirts hide shadows to make your chest seem smaller.
Wear scarves, vests, and ties. These garments help cover or distract others from looking at your chest.
Wearing clothes with pockets on the chest. Instead of looking at your chest, the eye may be drawn to your pocket. This is most effective if the shirt is loose hanging.
Wearing hoodies. Hoodies are usually quite loose fitting. An oversized hoodie over a tight tank can hide your chest quite well.
 Sports compression wear is mainly worn to improve blood circulation when exercising or to help relieve tension in muscles after working out. These form-fitting garments can be found in your local sportswear retail store.


The same effect can be achieved by wearing a tight swimming suit top. However, the swimming suit might need to be several sizes smaller for it to take effect and trimmed along the elastic hems to relieve pressure on your extremities.

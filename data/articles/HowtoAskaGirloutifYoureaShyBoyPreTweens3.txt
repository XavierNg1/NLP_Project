 Before you ask her out, see what her feelings on boys are. While some girls are ready to date at this age, others may just want friends.You should also ask her about her parent's views on dating. If they forbid it, it could make it harder for you to get a date with her.


You can start the conversation by saying something like, "I heard Marty and Sarah were dating now. What do you think about that?"
Ask her about her parents by asking something like, "My parents said it would be okay if I went to the movies with a girl. What do your parents think about that sort of stuff?"

, If you've talked to her, then you'll have a good idea what her interests might be. Think about what she likes and try to form a date around that. For instance, if she likes the outdoors, think of doing something at a park. If she likes movies, think of a movie that she would be excited about and ask your parents to get you tickets.
 Before you ask the girl out on a date, you need to make sure that you're allowed to go out on dates. Talk to your parents and be open and honest. Tell them about the girl, and why you want to see her more often. Calling it a relationship may scare your parents, so just tell them that you want to "hang out" with the girl.


You can say something like, "There's a girl in class that I like and I want to see if she wants to go to the movies. Would it be okay if we went together?"

, Asking a girl out via social media is most likely the least stressful way to ask her out, but it also is not as effective. She may not see the message for a while, or what you have to say may get confused via text. A better way to ask the girl out is by calling her on the phone or talking to her in person. Simply ask her if she'd like to go with you and do something together.


Ask her out by saying something like, "Hey I was wondering if you'd like to go the movies with me. I'm seeing the Avengers 5."

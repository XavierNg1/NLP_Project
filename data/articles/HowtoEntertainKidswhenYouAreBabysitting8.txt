 If they still don't do anything, then wait a little and make silly faces. If you can get them to laugh at you, soon they will trust and accept you more.


If a child is afraid of a monster hiding in their closet, make a "monster spray" using water in a spray bottle (bring one with you). Before bedtime, spray the child's room with the monster spray so they won't be afraid of the "monster".
 Do they have a slight tummy ache or are they bleeding? If they are bleeding or anything as bad, take them to A&E, whereas, if they have a slight tummy ache, tuck them into bed and read them stories, or draw with them.
 Treat the kids with respect. Expect good behavior and ignore minor misbehavior, which ought to be enough to make it stop.


Keep the kids entertained by offering reward for good behavior and help. Make them feel good by rewarding, but not too much. (Bring a little prize or treat for the end. If the kids were well behaved, then they can have the treat.)
Use time out as a last resort, only if the children are really misbehaving. It can be useful if they are being a danger to themselves or someone else. However, it is normally to be avoided because that is what they will remember the most from your visit and might be reluctant in wanting you to return.
 That way, you'll get a great review and you'll be asked back.


Clean up most of the house after the kids have gone to bed. The parents will really appreciate it. But don't reorganize things a different way, or change something completely. This might make the parents confused or mad if they can't find something.

 There are certain symptoms you can look if you think you have the flu. You may have some or all of the known symptoms of the flu, but they can vary per case. These symptoms should be watched for closely in those at higher risk of death or complications, such as the very young, the very old, those with HIV/AIDS or other immune suppression diseases, and those with cancer. The common symptoms of the flu to look out for are:Chills or fever
Cough and sore throat
A stuffy or runny nose
Body aches
Headaches
Fatigue
Vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults

, If you think you have the flu, see your doctor. He will do a physical exam and check your symptoms. Lab tests are usually not necessary. You may not need to see your doctor if you are generally in good health. However, if you are at high risk, use home treatments for one to two weeks without getting better, or experience severe symptoms, see your doctor immediately.Talk to your doctor about getting vaccinated before flu season. Vaccinations can make a significant difference in how the flu affects you, and you may not get it at all.
 Medical treatment is usually rest and fluids accompanied by some kind of medication that depends on your symptoms. You may be prescribed medications such as amantadine (Symmetrel), rimantadine (Flumadine), zanamavir (Relenza), or oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Other common medications include fever reducers such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, over the counter nasal decongestants, drowsy and non-drowsy antihistamines, and cough syrup.Do not use nasal decongestant sprays (such as Afrin) for more than five to seven days. After prolonged use, they can make your symptoms worse and actually cause congestion.

 Forget Dracula’s cape or similar extravagant wear. Stick to what would look commonplace in modern-day Washington state, like jeans, t-shirts, button-downs, jackets, sneakers, and boots.Since the movies were filmed on a low budget, many clothes featured are from affordable outlets like American Apparel, Loehmann’s, and Nordstrom.
The website https://thetake.com/movie/211/twilight identifies specific articles of clothing featured in the films.
 Draw more attention to your paler skin. Avoid clothes in light shades or shockingly bold colors. Stick to darker shades of neutral colors instead. To further suggest your vampire status, stick to cooler colors, such as blues and grays., Since vampires have lived for a considerably long time, expect most of them to have developed a refined, elegant look over the years. Mirror this aesthetic by matching colors and styles of clothing to avoid clashing. However, if you are specifically emulating the nomads in the series, feel free to mix and mismatch your clothes, since the nomads are portrayed in the movies as stealing random clothes from victims as needed.

 The Internet is a large place, which opens you up to exciting new options. However, hopes are that an online connection will lead to a real life one, so search for girls close to where you live. Do this by joining a local or neighborhood group and begin browsing for a potential match. , In the real dating world, many men meet women through mutual friends; Facebook is no different. Browse your friends’ female friends and see if there is a girl that catches your eye. Once you’ve found a girl you are interested in, your friend can give you information on her such as her interests and whether or not she is single. , Facebook profile pictures say a lot about a girl and what she is looking for in a man. According to clinical psychologist Abigail San, a girl with a profile picture with friends wants to project an exciting, interesting life, while a girl posing carefully for her photo is concerned with her appearance, and probably yours as well., Once you've become Facebook friends with a girl, examine the amount of personal information she has posted. A girl that has little information made public is likely a private person in real life. Avoid asking too many questions, or she may become more withdrawn. However, don’t neglect to ask any questions, as this may give her the idea that you are not interested., Some girls, even those in committed relationship catch a thrill from flirting on Facebook. While spotting fakers can be tricky, pay attention to subtle cues that may reveal that the girl is already taken., If a girl updates her status numerous times on a daily basis, it is likely that she prides herself on being socially active and having a lot of friends. Pick a light and fun destination at which to meet her so that she can fulfill her desire for fun.

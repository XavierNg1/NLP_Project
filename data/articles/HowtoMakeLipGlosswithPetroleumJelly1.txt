 You will need to melt the lip gloss before you pour it into its final container.






;
, The more lipstick you use, the more opaque your lip gloss will be. For a shimmery lip gloss, use a lipstick that already has some sparkle to it.
 This will help the lip stick mix into the petroleum jelly better.
 The mixture should be smooth, and without any lumps. If it is not smooth after you stir it, microwave it for another 30 seconds and stir again.
 You can use extract or candy-making flavoring.









Use no more than Â¼ teaspoon (1.25 milliliters) of almond oil, or your lip gloss may start to separate.You can also use some essential oil instead of the flavoring. Essential oil is very potent. Start with one drop, stir, then add more if needed.
 There should be no lumps, clumps, streaks, or swirls.
 Once you get the color you like, pour the mixture into a small container. Use a mini spatula, butter knife, or spoon to help guide it into the container, if needed.









You can find small containers in the paint section of an art store.
You can also use clean and empty lip gloss containers, contact lens cases, and pill boxes as well.
 If you are in a rush, put it into the fridge for a few hours. As the lip gloss cools, it will become more solid. You can apply it using your finger or a q-tip.

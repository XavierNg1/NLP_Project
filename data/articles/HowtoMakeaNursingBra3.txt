 You will still need a nursing bra with clasps for this method. Find a camisole that has rings where the straps connect to the body. This will allow you to connect your cami to your nursing bra without any sewing.


This method is perfect for women who are self-conscious about the baby weight around their stomach, or women who want more coverage as they breast feed.
This method allows you to pull your cami down without stretching or ripping the fabric, or having to hold it down with your hand.
Choose quality material like strong cotton or a cotton blend that wonâ€™t stretch out or tear easily.
Camis come in more colors than black, beige, or white (like other underwear). Feel free to choose colors that fit your personality and style.
 Using a pair of fabric scissors, cut the straps from the front and back of your cami. Leave the rings attached to the body of the cami. Straps can be disposed of or recycled as they will no longer be used.


Be sure to cut on a flat, hard surface to avoid mistakes in cutting.
On the back of the cami, cut in a quick, smooth motion to avoid fraying of the top.
 Choose small, black rubber bands that are usually used for hair styling. Take one rubber band and loop it around the ring, then pull it through to create a slip knot.Repeat on both sides of the cami.
 Put on your nursing bra followed by your newly made camisole. Make sure the garments aren't too tight and don't pinch your skin anywhere. Also make sure that your breasts are not constricted by the layers of garments.
 Unclasp your nursing bra and loop the rubber bands around the clasps of your bra. Re-clasp your bra and your nursing tank will stay attached until feeding time.When ready for use, unclasp one side of your nursing bra and pull down to expose your breast. The cami will follow while still keeping your stomach covered.
Be sure to remove rubber bands before washing and drying your tank. They can be easily reattached after laundering.

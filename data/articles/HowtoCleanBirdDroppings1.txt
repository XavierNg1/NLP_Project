 Using a warm, wet cloth, take a few passes at the spot to get the worst of the mess out of the way. Because of the way carpet and fabric upholstery are made, much of the droppings will collect and harden at the top of the fibers, making the bulk of it easier to wipe away. Use pinching, pulling motions with the wet cloth to coax the droppings out of the carpet or upholstery., Depending on exactly what type of surface you’re cleaning and what materials it’s made of, you’ll want to purchase some special cleaner that is guaranteed to work safely on that surface. Most standard carpet cleaners or all-purpose household cleaners will be mild enough to work on any kind of carpet, and foaming upholstery cleaners can be found at any supermarket or drugstore. Spray enough cleaner onto the spot to cover what’s left of it.If you do not have any specialized carpet cleaner on hand, you also have the option of mixing up a gentle solution consisting of mild laundry detergent, vinegar and warm water., Give the cleaner two or three minutes to sit on the spot. The chemical compounds in the cleaner will begin to eat away the hardened stain, making it easy to wipe away later.
 Use a damp washcloth to go over the spot once again. The stain-fighting power of the cleaner combined with the force of scrubbing by hand should be enough to take the spot out of your carpet or upholstery. If any traces are left after scrubbing, spray a little more cleaner on the spot, let it sit, then make a second attempt.


Scrub forcefully to ensure that you get as much of the dried-on mess out of the deeper layers of the carpet as you can.
Always wash any washcloth or towel that comes into contact with bird poop right away.

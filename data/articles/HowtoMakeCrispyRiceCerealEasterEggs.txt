 Be sure you wash eggs inside and out with warm soapy water and dry well before use.;
, You have 2 options:


Melt the butter in a large glass bowl for 30 seconds in the microwave.
Place butter in a saucepan and melt on the stove.



Continue to microwave in 30 second intervals until the marshmallows are melted.
Stir the marshmallows constantly until melted on the stove.
 Continue to combine well until cereal is well integrated into the marshmallow and butter.
 In order to form eggs, you will need to work with clean hands that have a coating of non-stick spray so cereal doesnâ€™t stick to your skin.
 Make sure you cover the walls on both halves of the eggs completely. Pack to the walls firmly. The amount of mix will depend on the size of the eggs - it should be enough to cover the inside.
, Use care removing the eggs as to not bend or break the crispy eggshells.
, Join the halves together with their corresponding halves.
, You're done creating crispy rice cereal Easter eggs!

 This method starts with the results of one of the other two methods. Beginning with average or super profits, the capitalization method determines how much capital is needed to produce those average or super profits, assuming the business earns a normal rate of return for the particular industry. This amount of capital is known as the capitalized value of profits, and the excess of this figure over the total capital employed can be considered goodwill.
 To find the capital employed, simply subtract the liabilities from the assets. It can also be represented as: Capital Employed = Assets - Liabilities.
 In order to use the the capitalization method, you must know how to calculate the capitalized value of profits.


In order to find the capitalized value of profits, you must first multiply the average or super profit by 100 (either one works). The total must then be divided by the normal rate of return. The formula can also be represented as: Capitalized Value of Average/Super Profits = Average/Super Profits X (100 / Normal Rate of Return). This formula calculates how much capital is required to earn the average or super profits of the business, assuming it made a normal rate of return.
 Simply subtract capital employed from step 2, from capitalized value of average or super profits. The formula looks like this: Goodwill = Capitalized Value of Average/Super Profits - Capital Employed.


Consider an example. Let's say that firm has average profits of $40,000, in an industry where the normal rate of return is 10%. The firm also has $1,000,000 in assets and $500,000 in liabilities. The total capitalized value of the firm is $40,000 × 100/10, which is equal to $400,000. The capital employed = $1,000,000 − $700,000, which leaves $300,000. Finally, goodwill is equal to capitalized value of profits minus the capital employed, or $400,000 − $300,000. The goodwill is $100,000.
With this method, goodwill is reflective of the difference between the rate of return of the business in question, and the normal rate of return. For example, in this scenario, the business would earn a 13% return on capital employed ($40,000/$300,000). The normal return, however, is 10%. This method simply takes that 3% premium, and "capitalizes" it, or determines how much capital employed would be required to produce that $40,000 return based on a 10% normal return. In this case, it would require $400,000, or $100,000 more than the actual fair value of the businesses assets. This $100,000 could be added to the fair value of the business when selling or purchasing it, as a reflection of the company's strong returns.

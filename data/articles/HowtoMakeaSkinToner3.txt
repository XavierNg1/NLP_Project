 In a glass or plastic bottle, mix together 1 cup (237 ml) of filtered water, 1 cup (237 ml) of raw apple cider vinegar, and 3 drops of tea tree oil. Shake the bottle gently to ensure that the ingredients are fully combined.Use an airtight container that can hold at least 16 ounces for the toner.
The toner recipe calls for 1 part water and 1 part apple cider vinegar, so you can adjust it accordingly to make as much or as little as you’d like.
 When you’re ready to use the toner, dampen a cotton square, ball, or pad with the mixture. Next, gently rub it over your entire face after washing it, paying particular attention to areas where you usually get acne. Don’t rinse the toner off.You can also store the toner in a spray bottle and mist it over your face if you prefer.
 After you’ve applied the toner, wait 2 to 3 minutes so your skin can fully absorb it. Next, apply your usual acne treatment products, such as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, to treat your breakouts.

, Do not give it more than one of each animal. No chaos drives can be given after it reincarnates for the 2nd time.
 For a Hero Chaos Chao, look after it with Heroes. For a Neutral Chaos Chao, look after it with both Hero and Dark characters. For a Dark Chaos Chao, look after it with Dark characters. A Chao's past two lives do not impose on what the chao will become in its third. For example, if you wanted a Hero Chaos Chao, you could make it a Dark chao in its 1st life and a Neutral chao the second. Just be sure you use the right alignment characters you want for its third life, along with the 21 animals in the games,and some fruit.
 If done right, it should evolve into a Chaos Chao. *Note* Even after this is done correctly, there is a chance (3-7%) that it will not evolve into a Chaos Chao so don't freak out if it didn't work. Also, you never have to feed hero/dark fruit to the chao for it to become a Chaos Chao.


This won't work if your chao dislikes you, so don't abuse it (throw it, punch/kick it, take away its fruit as it eats is abuse), and pet it to keep it happy(not too much, or it'll become lazy and spoiled). Will not work if it's already a hero or dark chao.

 This means never freaking out, or going "Section 8 Sicko" on anyone in public.


Always act calm, no matter what!






Don’t get carried away, ever.






Keep your voice low and steady, and never cry or get sad in public.






Don’t cause too much drama and if you do, make sure it’s meaningful. (Ex, someone is spreading a rumour about you or is being mean, then it’s fine to get some backup. But even then, don’t waste your breath; it’s no big deal!)






Look people in the eye when you talk, and don’t talk too loud. (If you talk loudly, it should be in class or at any rehearsals/practices. And even then, do so respectfully.)






Don’t act hyper. Don’t lie about being bad. (Acting hyper means being weird and saying random things and overall, just trying too hard. It doesn’t mean you can’t stand up for what you believe in, and it doesn’t mean that you can’t have a personality.)






Don’t tell everyone if you do happen to get a boyfriend, and even then, don’t prioritize him above all else. And don’t act needy; give him some space. (Don’t rush him into kissing you, and don’t even rush the hugging! Let him decide, but if nothing is happening. Take some initiative, but don’t be pushy and off-putting!)






Keep your cool, and simply reply with a more than snappy comment in a low, indifferent voice when you get mad. (Don’t turn red, and especially don’t yell or get physical. If you get to the point where you’re about to yell or touch them, simply smile sweetly and walk away. You’ll be the bigger person in the end.)






Don’t brag about your grades, or never studying. (It’s good to make an effort for your grades and it’s nicer to keep it to yourself. Ex, don’t get riled up over a bad grade, simply work even harder in order to better it. Don’t take it out on anyone! Ex, don’t brag wildly about a good grade, just give a half smile and shrug, and then put it away. Ex, if someone asks you get grades, make it a mystery: Offer up a “So-so,” and then shrug it off. Then, when they ask to see your report card, they’ll be shocked!)






Always be ready to surprise someone (practice your singing and rarely sing in public. Practice acting and then try out for drama. Practice dancing and then seldom dance in public. Practice reading and volunteer to read in class on day, out of the blue. Practice some random talent and then one day, offer it up. But don’t brag, or even play up your talents).

, Seek out what their hobbies, and personal favourites, and once you have an overall understanding of your friends, and others that you might approach, then start conversations casually. Always maintain an air of comfort and ease when talking to people, like so:


You: *in a steady voice.* Oh... hey, Amanda!
(Amanda isn't a really good friend of yours, but she's on your cousin's soccer team.) Amanda: Hey.
You: I've been meaning to ask you about soccer. I missed a few games, and I wanted to know where you're playing next. (Maintain your volume at a comfortable, low level.)
Amanda: Really? I didn't even know you went! But we're playing at Bryce Field next, it's like a mile from my house?
You: Oh, yeah I've been there once. Anyway, I'll be at your next game so keep an eye out.
Amanda: Definitely!
You: I'm late for chorus... But good luck at the game! Bye.
 So make sure you work on it! Pick more subtle, solid ensembles that make you seem true to yourself and real.

Comfy Chic: Pair dark leggings or yoga pants with a solid colored tunic (Old Navy has cheap ones!) and clean sneakers. Keep your clean and properly styled, and you'll look pretty.






High Fashion Look: Skinny jeans in a darker wash, paired with a dark or solid tee, in a looser fit and flats or boots always make you seem more sophisticated. Straighten your hair maybe, and brush it out very smoothly.
 Create an alluring look and dress up a bit. Show it off! And then have some fun with your smile and just be very welcoming that day. This will get people seeing another side of you that they might really like, and leave them wanting more! But only do it every once in a while, to keep the mystery!

 Shellac is usually applied with a sponge, to maintain the wet edge.


Get your sponge as saturated with shellac as possible before beginning your application.
 Be sure to maintain a wet edge as you apply each band, working quickly across each face of the wood, one band at a time.


Start at one end of the wood face and work across quickly, making sure that the shellac doesn't dry as you apply the bands.
Shellac is a challenging sealant to apply, because you need to keep each band wet as you work on the next one.
 In contrast to polyurethane, you should not interfere with the shellac's drying process or manipulate it in any way.

Do not use steel wool.






Do not sand the shellac in between band applications.






The shellac melts into itself with each subsequent coat, creating a smooth finish on its own.






You can apply anything over shellac if you have another finish you like.

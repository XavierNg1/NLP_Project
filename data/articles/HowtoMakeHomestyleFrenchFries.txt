 Measure flour and sift or blend with a fork in order to remove any lumps. Have on hand a shaker bag (a small brown lunch bag will do), or have ready an area to roll the fries in flour. Have the skillet facing out and on top of the stove burner.;
, Begin by slicing each potato in half, and slice each half in to thick wedges. Each half should make three to four thick fries, which is the goal.
 It will need to be enough to totally cover the fries. The exact amount of oil you want will depend on the number of fries that one has chosen to prepare. One may only want to cook a few fries at a time as opposed to a larger amount. Use your own judgment on the amount of oil that will be needed.
 Then use a shaker bag (or prepared area) to fully coat the fries in flour.
 Test the oil by dropping in one fry or a little chunk of wet flour.
 When the flour begins to turn light brown, reduce the heat a bit and cover. This allows the fries to fully cook on the inside as well as the outside. Repeat until all fries are cooked.

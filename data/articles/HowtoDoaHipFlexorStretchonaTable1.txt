 The table you choose needs to be solid and capable of holding your body weight while you're laying on it. Make sure the legs are even so the table doesn't wobble, and that it won't slide if you move on it. You also can use a weight bench.When choosing the correct height, keep in mind that the exercise will be easier if you can rest your feet firmly on the floor than it would be if your feet are dangling over the edge. The taller the table, the more challenging the stretch will be.;
, Sit on one end of the top of the table and lie back. Make sure the table or bench you're using is long enough, and slide down until the edge of the table is behind your knees and your feet are hanging off the side.You can make the exercise more challenging by moving closer to the edge of the table, so that less of your legs are supported. No matter how close to the edge you are, keep your thighs parallel to the floor and your knees at right angles.
 Grasp one of your knees and pull it toward you, bending your leg as you do. Focus on keeping your other leg flat against the table. Only pull your leg as close to your chest as you can without pain or discomfort., You should feel a stretch in the upper thigh and hip of the leg resting on the table. Hold this stretch for a minute to a minute and a half. Breathe deeply and keep your hold steady rather than pulsing., Lower your leg in a slow, controlled motion. After taking a few deep breaths, you're ready to do the same stretch with the other leg. Notice any differences between how the stretch feels on one leg versus the other.

 The best way to get good is to practice, and the best practice is reading notes as quickly as you can. There are many online quizzes for free, but you can also print out a collection of notes on a bass clef (or have a friend or teacher write one) and practice identifying each one perfectly.As you get better, time yourself on each quiz. Work on improving your accuracy along with your speed -- don't sacrifice quality for speed until you can get each note without mistakes.
 Print out or write down a staff with a random collection of notes. As you identify each one, play the same note on your instrument. This will train your brain to not only identify the note but the sound and the physical positioning of each part of the staff. You'll improve your playing speed considerably as a result.
 If you want to work on reading music, in any clef, read music and play. Even if you mostly improvise, work on scales, or don't use written music, you should still devote 10-20 minutes to reading music and playing along.
 Sight reading is when you put a brand new piece of sheet music in front of you and play it as you read for the first time. It isn't easy, but it is one of the best ways to get speedy on the staff.Again, make sure you don't sacrifice quality for speed. Play it at half time if you're continuously missing notes or have to stop and start. Remember -- this is practice, not a performance.

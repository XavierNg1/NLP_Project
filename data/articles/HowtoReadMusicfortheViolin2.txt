 There are a number of symbols that indicate how to play with the violin’s bow. A V shaped marking under the note indicates bow movement in an upward direction., A shape that resembles a table (rectangle with two legs coming out of the bottom) is the notation for playing the bow in a downward motion.
 There may be an accent, depicted by an angle bracket symbol (>), above or below the note. This means that you should play the note strongly., A symbol shaped like a thickly drawn comma indicates a bow lift. When you see this symbol above a note, lift your bow and bring it back to the starting point., Sometimes, violin music will include initials, which directs the player on which part of the bow to use on a particular note or segment of music.The following are the typical initials used to determine which part of the bow to use:


WB: Whole bow
LH: Lower half of the bow
UH: Upper half of the bow
MB: Middle of the bow

, There are numerous other bow notations, particularly as you read more advanced violin music or music from an earlier era.These notations indicate advanced techniques to achieve certain sounds, such as:



Col legno: This means “with the wood.” Use the bow’s stick, rather than the hair, to play the strings. This can be damaging to the wood of the bow, so many musicians use alternate bows for these musical segments.

Sul ponticello: Position the bow at the bridge of the violin (at the body of the violin) to achieve a whispery tone.

Au talon: This refers to a section of music that should be played with the bow at the nut of the violin (the area between the fingerboard and the pegbox).

Martelé: This term means “hammered,” and indicates that you put pressure on the string with the bow and then draw the bow across the string with force. Release the bow pressure almost immediately from the string.

 Nothing needs to be in perfect condition! A poorly kept, decrepit witch is no less evil than a well turned out one.;
, Your evil witch dress can be inspired by any period in time. Wear a sleek, elegant modern evening dress if you wish, you can be the type of evil witch who uses her stunning looks to achieve her evil desires. Find something with a touch of the puritanical, as would of been seen in the Times of the Salem Witch Trials or go further back in history and go for something even older and take inspiration from the late 1400s.
 Add some boots to your outfit.
 Improvise with a shawl, blanket or throw if you can't find a suitably evil looking cape.
 Wear a long black wig, or even a bald wig! In the Roald Dahl book, The Witches, all the terribly evil witches are actually bald! If you have long dark hair already, you could add a white or grey streak. Make your hair look like you've been for a wild ride on your broom stick if you like.
 Go traditional brimmed, pointed hat if you want to be traditional. Wear a Puritan's bonnet, or, a jaunty mini witches hat, for a more modern, sophisticated evil witch look.
 Black nail polish can stain, apparently. If you want to go for the evil, unkempt witch look, you could rub coffee grounds into your nails to make them look dirty, like you've Bern mixing poison potions.
 If you are being a witch from 1480 or so, makeup isn't really required. You can make yourself look glamourous and evil, or raddled, aged and evil.

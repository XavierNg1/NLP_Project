 Lay it down on a flat surface. If it’s small enough to be moved when the TARDIS is finished, lay it on a sheet of paper or other protective material. If it’s going to stay where you build it, make sure the ground is level and not subject to moisture. Lay down a tarp if necessary.


Base = 1u square x .2u high.
 This will be the framework for everything that follows, so build this part carefully.
 With a pencil, mark the inside top of the base around all 4 corners at .05u. For example, if your base is 4 cm square, make a mark at .2 cm. (4 x .05 = .2)

, Draw a line between the center points of your marks with pencil as a guide for placing the other parts of the TARDIS build.
 Glue the posts to the base so that they sit inside the guidelines, as shown.
 Place the ceiling board on top of the corner posts, aligned so that the edges are flush.

 This serum will add moisture to your skin all-day long, and give it that glow you are looking for.
 Use small dots, and dab it on to your face with the tip of your index or ring finger. Gently blot it in to the skin on your face and neck. Do not use more than one finger per hand, as you will apply too much pressure to the sensitive skin areas.

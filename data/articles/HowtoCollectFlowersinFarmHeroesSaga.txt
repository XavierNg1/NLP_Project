 From the game map, tap or click the level you want to play. Not all levels have flowers. The first one that has it is Level 12.;
, Each level will require you to collect a certain number of cropsies. Keep this in mind, so you won’t lose focus when blooming the flowers.
 Before you attack your level, know first where the flowers are located. You may not see them first because they aren’t in bloom yet. You can identify the flowers by the four leaves with a spiral on top.
 In order to collect a flower, three different matches need to be made right next to it. Look at the cropsies surrounding the flowers and plan your moves.


Remember your objectives or goals for the level.
 Identify a flower you want to collect. Choose a match you can make from the cropsies surrounding the flower that will also contribute to the goals of the level. Do not match cropsies that won’t count towards the goals, unless there’s no other option.


Swap cropsies to make your first match. The cropsies will be removed, and the flower will start to grow. You can now see the flower’s face.
 You don’t need to work on a flower on consecutive moves. You can make matches elsewhere, especially if you have better moves there.


Once you see that you can make matches from the cropsies surrounding the flower that will also contribute to the goals of the level, swap those to make your second match. The cropsies will be removed, and the flower will grow further. You can now see the flower smile.
 Swap cropsies from the cropsies surrounding the flower to make your third match. The cropsies will be removed, and the flower will fully bloom. The flower will be removed and added to your collection.
 Work on the other flowers on the board until you reach the target number of flowers to be collected. Don’t forget the other goals of the level too.

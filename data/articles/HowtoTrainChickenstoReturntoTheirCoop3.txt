 Sometimes chickens that have been coop trained will vacate their coop and refuse to re-enter it. This is often caused by a predator entering the coop or the conditions in the coop being unhealthy for the chickens.Look for any areas that a predator could have gained access to the coop and secure it.
Ensure the coop is relatively clean and the food and water are easy to access. Also check the temperature to make sure it is not exceeding 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
The stressor that caused the chickens to leave must be identified and resolved prior to retraining your chickens to return to the coop.
 Once you have made sure the coop is safe for your chickens, you will need to catch or corral them all back into the coop. If your chickens are able to walk around a large yard, it may be difficult to catch them all.


Try approaching sleeping chickens at night slowly with a flashlight. Don’t shine the light directly on the chickens as it may wake them. Once you’re close, gently pick each chicken up and return it to the coop.
Use food to distract a chicken during the day, then approach it slowly from behind. Once you are close enough, gently pick the chicken up and return it to its coop.
 Once all of the chickens are back in the coop, secure the coop and keep the chickens confined to it for a week. This will re-establish the coop as their safe haven and home in the minds of the chickens.Release the chickens again after a week. If they do not return to the coop that night, check the conditions of the coop again to make sure the water and food can be reached by all chickens and the temperature is below seventy degrees.
Secure the chickens for a second week if they do not begin returning to the coop at dusk and the coop is in good condition.

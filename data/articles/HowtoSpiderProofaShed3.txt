 The more glue traps you use, the more spiders you’ll catch, so place lots at spots like each of the shed’s corners and on shelving. Go for flat glue traps without raised perimeter edges, as these are the best for catching spiders.Check the glue traps regularly, and replace them when they’re covered with critters. Get help from a brave friend or family member if necessary!
You can find glue traps at your local grocery or hardware store.
 Choose a liquid pesticide that contains synthetic pyrethroids and apply it around the shed’s exterior base, as well as at any vents or other openings. While pesticide barriers don’t always work against spiders in the long-term, they do keep out flies, ants, and other creepy crawlies that provide food for spiders.Bug bombs and foggers aren’t very effective in deterring spiders, but they could be useful if you have a fly or ant problem and need to get rid of spider food sources.If you go with an insecticide, remember to read and follow the instructions carefully.
 You could try spraying white vinegar at the shed’s entrance and other openings to keep away spiders. While hard to find in most locations, Osage oranges contain a chemical that might deter spiders and insects. If you can find one, cut it in half and leave the halves in the shed.You could even paint your shed blue, which is said to repel spiders. Just keep in mind there’s no scientific evidence that supports natural repellents like the color blue, vinegar, and Osage oranges., If sealing points of entry, decluttering, cleaning, store-bought insecticides, and natural repellents don’t work, it might be time to consult a professional. Spider control is usually part of the basic services provided by most professional exterminators.A first-time professional application typically costs around $100 (US). Taking care of an infestation of dangerous spiders could cost up to several hundred dollars.

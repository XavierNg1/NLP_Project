 An exit code allows you to signify to the telephone service provider that the phone number you enter following that code will be an international number, effectually allowing you to "exit" your country.


The exit code varies by country. While many countries share the same exit code, there is no single exit code that works for every country.
For example, the exit code for the United States is "011." As such, someone calling England from the United States would dial "011" before dialing anything else.
Example: 011-xx-xxxxxxxxxx;
, The country code for England and the entire United Kingdom is "44." This code should be dialed immediately after the exit code for your country.


When placing an international phone call, a country code indicates which country the phone call should be directed to. Each country has its own unique country code.
Example: 011-44-xxxxxxxxxx

, When calling from inside England, you will use a local code or trunk code. This code is simply a leading "0."


If you were given an English phone number with a leading "0," this digit should be skipped when you place your international call. The phone number will not connect correctly if you keep it.The only exception to this rule is Russia and Italy. If calling England from either of these countries, keep the leading “0.”

, Every land line in England will have an area code that corresponds to the geographic location in which the structure you are calling is located. Area codes range in length from two to five digits.

, Cell phones in England do not use standard geographic area codes. Instead, they have a mobile code that varies based on the mobile network the cell phone is covered by.


You will need to inquire about the exact mobile code when attempting to call an English cell phone. There is no way of knowing with exact certainty without directly finding it out.
All mobile area codes start with the number 7 and are usually followed by either a 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
In total, the mobile code should be four digits long.
 The rest of the phone number is simply the subscriber's personal number. Dial it as you would dial any local phone number to complete the call.


For landlines, the subscriber's personal phone number will be a total of 10 digits long. This does NOT include the area code.
Example: 011-44-20-xxxx-xxxx (dials from the US to England, to a land line in London)
Example: 011-44-161 (dials from the US to England, to a land line in Manchester)
Example: 011-44-1865 (dials from the US to England, to a land line in Oxford)
For cell phones, the subscriber's personal phone number will be 10 digits long. This DOES include the mobile code.
Example: 011-44-74xx-xxx-xxx (dials from the US to a cell phone in England)

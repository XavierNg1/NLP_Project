 These are not a good look. Grab a clean washcloth and run it under cold water. Press it to the delicate skin under your eye and hold it there. Do this for a couple of minutes, applying light pressure, to reduce the bags.If you are regularly waking up with bags under your eyes, make sure you are getting enough sleep.
 Look for a product that is light-reflective to really brighten up your skin. Just like with your foundation, the key is to use a small amount and to lightly blend it out with your fingertip or a small brush. Apply the concealer along the bottom of your eye, focusing on the inner and outer corners.After you’ve applied your under eye concealer, try lining your bottom waterline with white eyeliner to make your eyes appear even bigger and brighter., Carefully use the eyelash curler first. Position your eyelashes between the clamps of the curler, holding your curler as close to your lash line (and your eyelid) as possible without accidentally pinching any skin. Press and hold down for 10 seconds to achieve a beautiful curl.After your eyelashes are curled, it's time for mascara. Choose a color that doesn’t overpower your face. If you have dark hair, a black mascara will probably work best. Blondes and lighter brunettes should stick with a brown mascara. Keep your lashes from looking clumpy by making sure the product is evenly distributed along the mascara wand.Start at the base of your lashes and work the wand to the ends, gently wiggling it as you go. This will also help to avoid clumping, and keep your eyelashes from looking weighed down with product.
For the natural look you desire, one coat of mascara should do the trick.
If you have thick lashes, you can skip this step all together.

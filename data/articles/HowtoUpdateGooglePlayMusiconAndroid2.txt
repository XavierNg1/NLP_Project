 To launch the Play Store, tap on the white shopping bag with the Play icon in the middle. This should take you to the Play Store main screen.
 Enter “Play Music” in the search field at the top of the screen, and tap the magnifying glass icon to begin the search.


From the results, select the app, and you will be taken to its information page.
 If Play Music needs updating, you’ll find an “Update” button on the upper part of the page; otherwise, you’ll see an “Open” button.


To update, tap the “Update” button and then “Accept” on the pop-up. The update will begin downloading and installing on your device.
The update progress will be displayed on the app’s info page, and when it’s done, you will be notified of the update’s success.

Nonmember wings such as freedom wings or mech angel wings can be obtained by getting the treasure chest at the top of Sky High, the chests on the hard mode of an adventure or an animal door on an adventure. You could also trade a few rare item Mondays for one. Butterfly wings cost 150 gems, and are also nonmember. If you don't already have a wolf, normal nonmember wolves (which slightly resemble coyotes) are 1000 gems and member arctic wolves (which are big, fluffy and more wolf-like) are 10 diamonds.
If your animal slots are full, you could recycle an animal or make a new account, where you can choose a starting animal (including normal wolf) and has 1000 gems, though new accounts start out nonmember and can't wear wings or inflatable angel wings.;
, As a reminder, wings are in Jam Mart Clothing, inflatable angel wings are sold at the Horses Only Party (you need a member horse to enter) and freedom wings (red, white and blue versions of normal wings) and Mech Angel wings are obtained through adventure chests on hard mode, animal gates or the chest on the top of Sky High, this may take some time. Nonmembers also can buy butterfly wings for 150 gems at Jam Mart Clothing.

 You can use Google to perform searches of all of the pages on a website. This can help you find matching words on large or complex websites.
 This will tell Google to only search through pages on that site.
 You can enter a single word, or you can enter phrases. To have Google look for an exact word or phrase, surround it with quotes.For example, to search wikiHow for any page that has the word "banana", you would type site:wikihow.com banana. To search wikiHow for any page that has the phrase "eat a banana", you would type site:wikihow.com "eat a banana".
 Google will return any pages that match your search, but it won't point you to the matching text once you open the page. You'll need to use the Find tool to jump to where the word occurs on the page.


See the previous section for information on using the Find tool.

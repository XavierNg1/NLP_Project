 Such supermarkets are always ready to accept any reasonable changes. Stress the qualities of the products which they like most - popular, quality, price, brand, tasty, delicious, cheap, a brand they already stock. Find similar places in the area and write the same message to them. Do same for one month or two. Simply keep on and be persistent. If you have vegetarian friends in the area, ask them to campaign the supermarkets as well. Many supermarkets have product request postcards available around the store or at the cash register. Start by filling out one of those as well.;
, A vegan diet can be more difficult to pursue than a lacto-ovo one.
 See if the farmers will sell directly to you, or if they participate in a farmer's market. If you follow a lacto-ovo diet and animal cruelty is a concern, ask the farmer about their animal care practices. Look for free-range and vegetarian fed chicken eggs in your local dairy section if you choose to include eggs in your diet.
 If you are staying in a rooming house and don't have consistent access to a stove, ask if you can keep a microwave or rice steamer in your quarters. When eating at restaurants, ask in detail the ingredients of the dish. Not all people assume vegetarian to mean the same thing. You may want to ask if the dish is flavored with animal derived broths or contains gelatin.
 Many people are under the false assumption that eating vegetarian means surviving mainly on salads and bland unseasoned vegetables. You may be surprised at your friends' or family's positive reactions after eating a tasty, filling, yet healthy and 100% vegetarian meal.

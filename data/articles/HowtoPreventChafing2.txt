 One of the most popular products used by runners to prevent chafing is body glide.Simply apply it to areas that are prone to chafing, like between your legs, under your arms, and on your nipples. The lubricant should stay on your skin and absorb moisture during even the hottest days of the year.Another lubricant that you can get over the counter is Monistat Soothing Care Chafing Relief Powder Gel.Other popular lubricant products include HikeGoo and Red11., Look for a powder that has micro-particle polymers that glide over your skin and absorb sweat.


Try a powder that will keep your skin dry, like the bizarrely named Lady Anti Monkey Butt Powder., Thought this may be a bit DIY, cutting band aids in half and applying them to your nipples will create a barrier between your clothing and your skin as you run.You can also apply NipGuardto the area before a run to prevent chafing in the nipple area.

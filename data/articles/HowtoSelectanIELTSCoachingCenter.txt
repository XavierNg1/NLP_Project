 A reputable and well known institute is more likely to have a larger student base, with more resources and opportunities for exposure. This will help in interacting with others who are also planning on similar careers and thus lead to the exchange of ideas and information.;
, The quality of teachers is of utmost importance, as IELTS depends heavily on the expertise of trainers. Foreign nationals who have experience in teaching are more suited for the role as the students can imbibe the accent and pronunciations more accurately.
 The strength of the class is another consideration, as this will determine the individual attention that each student receives. An institute which has several sessions with a concentrated student group in each will be more effective in the training process.
 Moreover, some centers provide added facilities which can be very useful. These include career counseling, interactive sessions with experts from various fields, discussions with representatives of colleges, institutes and so on. While looking for an IELTS center these perks should be kept in mind.
 Location is very important. Lastly, the location of the center, the timings of classes and the expense involved are other important factors to consider, specially for those who wish to undergo training simultaneously with work, college etc. The center should be conveniently located and the timings should be such that you are able to extract maximum from the course without unnecessary stress which may have adverse effects.

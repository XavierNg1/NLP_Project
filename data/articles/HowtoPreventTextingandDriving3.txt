 Every time you get the urge to text while driving, ask yourself, “Is reading that text right this moment worth crashing my car?” or something similar. By thinking about the risk each time you want to text, it may help you get out of the habit completely.This can also help you learn patience. Having the patience not to text because of the risks can be a good thing.
 Many websites and cell phone companies have pledges that you can take against texting and driving. The pledge is your promise that you will never text and drive. By pledging, you acknowledge the dangers of texting and driving and that it can injure or kill other drivers.By taking the pledge, you are honoring your word every time you refuse to text and drive.
You can take the pledge at Texting and Driving Safety or It Can Wait.
 Before you get behind the wheel, send a text telling someone the conversation will be on hold for now because you are driving. You may also use a code at the end of a text, like #D that lets the person you are texting know you are about to start driving.When you let someone know you are driving, you can tell them, “I am driving. I will not respond for the next 45 minutes. You can wait that long to respond so I’m not distracted.”

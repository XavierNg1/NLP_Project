 How you see yourself is an important part of your personality. By believing that you are introverted, you may shy away from social activities. On the flip side, identifying yourself as an extrovert may can encourage you to go out and interact with people.You can affirm this identity by being sure to repeat it to yourself daily. You can also visualize yourself as being this new person.
Another way to affirm the identity is to take another personality test and see how your scores have changed over time.
 A personality change is only permanent if you continue to work at the changes. That means you will need to form habits that reinforce the personality that you have created. These will likely do simple, daily routines instead of major events.For example, if youâ€™ve decided to be more conscientious, you could take time to meditate each day and be present in the moment.
Another consideration is to be mindful of the environment you put yourself in. Place yourself in environments that are in line with the personality you would like to reflect. Avoid hanging around people who reflect the opposite of the personality you would like to adopt. Develop connections and friendships with people who will help you through your personality change process. These friends should be reliable and available for you when you need them. They will help motivate you during times of challenge.
 Throughout the course of life, everyone changes. Even once you create your new personality, it will be subject to change. This is not a bad thing. The changes that your personality goes through are generally a result of growth and maturity.

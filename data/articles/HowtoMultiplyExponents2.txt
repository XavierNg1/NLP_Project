 Since the exponents have different bases, there is no shortcut for multiplying them. Calculate the exponent using a calculator or by hand. Remember, an exponent tells you how many times to multiply a number by itself.

For example, if you are multiplying 23×45{\displaystyle 2^{3}\times 4^{5}}, you should note that they do not have the same base. So, you will first calculate 23=2×2×2=8{\displaystyle 2^{3}=2\times 2\times 2=8}.
 Do this by multiplying the base number by itself however many times the exponent says.

For example, 45=4×4×4×4×4=1024{\displaystyle 4^{5}=4\times 4\times 4\times 4\times 4=1024}


, Following the same example, your new problem becomes 8×1024{\displaystyle 8\times 1024}.
 This will give you the final answer to the problem.

For example: 8×1024=8192.{\displaystyle 8\times 1024=8192.} So, 23×45=8,192{\displaystyle 2^{3}\times 4^{5}=8,192}.

 You will be making a liquid solution using borax, sugar, and water, and then soaking cotton balls into this solution. Here is what you will need:


½ cup (100 grams) of sugar
1 ½ tablespoons borax
1 ½ cups (350 milliliters) warm water
A jar
Cotton balls
Shallow dishes, small containers, or lids (optional);
, The borax is what will kill the ants, and the sugar is what will attract them to the borax. Ants don't see borax as a food source, so they won't come near it—the sugar will be an effective bait.
 You are doing this to mix the borax and sugar together.
 You can use any temperature water, but warm water will help the sugar and borax dissolve better. The water will turn the borax and sugar into a liquid solution, which will make it easier for you to dip the cotton balls into.
 Keep stirring until all of the sugar and borax are dissolved—or at least most of it.
 How many cotton balls you use will depend on how bad the ant infestation is. If you have any of the solution left over, you can save it simply by putting the lid back on the jar and storing it in a cool, dry place.
 Focus on the ant trails; you want to place the cotton ball right onto the trail itself. If you can find where the ants are coming from, you can set the soaked cotton balls near there. This will help them find the poison even sooner.


If you don't want to get your floors or window ledges dirty and sticky, you can place the soaked cotton ball in a small container first, and then set the container out. You can also use a shallow dish or a jar lid. Whatever container you chose to use, make sure that you don't use it for food purposes again. Borax is very toxic to humans and pets as well.
 If you have located the hole where the ants are coming from, you can seal it with some epoxy putty or sealing paste. This will prevent the ants from coming back. Do this after you have killed all of the ants, and not before.

 Whether you're dancing with your wife of 60 years or someone you've never met before, thank your partner. You can just say, "Thank you for the dance," or "I hope we can do that again soon, thank you," to make your partner feel special. If you're a guy and are feeling playful, you can even give the girl a little bow as you thank her to make her feel special and show how much fun you had.









If you end the dance in this sophisticated manner, then the person will be more likely to dance with you in the future.
 Once you're comfortable with slow dances, you might not want to flee the floor as quickly as possible: one dance is just the beginning. If, however, you've had enough dancing for the moment, retreat from the dance floor. And if you haven't had the best time slow dancing with the person, taking a break is a good way to keep that person at bay.









Offer to escort your partner to his or her table or wherever he or she wants to go, or ask him or her if they would like to retreat if you want to do so.
If you enjoyed the slow dance and the music speeds up, don't be afraid. You can continue to dance to faster-paced music with the same dance partner, as long as you're both in the mood for more dancing.

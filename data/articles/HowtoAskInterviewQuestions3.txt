 To be well-informed during your interview, learn as much as you can about your interview subject and the topic you will be discussing before speaking with them. While the internet can be a quick way to get information, be sure that your sources are credible. Double check information with several sources, or refer to peer-reviewed, academic sources (e.g. scholarly journals)., If you are interviewing a public figure who has conducted other interviews, refer to those discussions and look for a missing link in the narrative. While other interviewers may opt to ask the same, buzz-worthy questions and yield the same results, you can conduct an original interview by asking about something they’ve overlooked.For instance, while other reporters may be asking a local sports hero about their winning streak, you can shift the focus by asking them about their participation in local community organizations.
 Having a recording of your interview will vastly improve your chances of accurately representing the discussion later on. Record the interview on your smart phone, or using a simple tape recorder. Note that you must ask your interview subject’s permission before recording any conversation you have with them., Whether or not you are recording your interview electronically, take notes about other details of the conversation. These may include distinguishing features of the interviewee, things that were happening in the background during the interview, or notable emotional reactions to certain questions. If you can’t record these details during the interview, write them down immediately following it while the experience is still fresh in your mind.For instance, note that the cafe that you conducted the interview in was particularly crowded that day, and that your interview subject teared up when asked about their parents.

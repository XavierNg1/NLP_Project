This type of body language includes making regular eye contact, smiling a lot and acting friendly, and standing up straight.
 Acknowledge who you are and what you really like. Don’t try to be someone that you’re not. Don’t try to please other people who want you to change. Take pride in your strengths and the qualities that make you unique.
 This will show potential girlfriends that you care about yourself enough that you treat your body well. Eat plenty of healthy foods, get enough sleep, and get regular exercise. Cut back on alcohol and stop smoking.
 Don’t dedicate all of your time to finding a girlfriend. Make sure to continue spending time with your friends. It’s important that you keep your own interests in mind as you search for a girlfriend.

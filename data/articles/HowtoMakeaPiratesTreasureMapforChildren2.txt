 Try finding a local park where you have a lot of open space to keep an eye on your kids.
 Find large and obvious landmarks like a stand alone oak tree, a fountain, a bridge or a large rock that you can mark on a map. Note how far away they are away from each other, and which direction you will have to travel to find the next "landmark." It will help to describe these distances in terms of "paces" (so don't spread out the landmarks too much).

 If you’re having trouble locating healthy juices, you can make some yourself with a juicer. A juicer is a device that allows you to separate the flesh of a given fruit from its juices. One cup of 100% fruit juice or vegetable juice – the kind obtained from a juicer – counts as one cup of fruit.Most juicers have a slot into which you insert sliced chunks of the fruit of your choice. The device then pumps juice out one end and collects pulp in a separate removable container.
Consult manufacturer directions before use.
Do not drink juice as your only source of fruits and veggies., Some people choose healthy fruit juices with the intent to switch to a liquid-only diet as part of a weight-loss plan, or because they cannot consume solid food due to a medical condition. However, unlike whole fruits and veggies, juices lack significant amounts of fiber.Fiber is the indigestible portion of the fruit or vegetable that helps increase nutrient absorption and keeps the gut clean.
If you’re on a juice or liquid-only diet for a medical reason, your doctor might prescribe a fiber supplement to you.
Some juicers incorporate fruit and vegetable pulp back into the juice so that you can get additional fiber.
 Homemade juices can be made safely if the fruit or vegetables used to produce it are cleaned thoroughly, and if the juicer itself is clean. Clean your juicer’s many removable parts with soap and hot water after each use.To clean fruits and veggies, simply place them under swiftly flowing cool water. This will remove excess biocides, fertilizers, and grime. Do not use alcohol, soap, or other cleaning agents.
Remove produce stickers from your fruits or veggies before juicing them.
If you have several fruits you wish to use at once, place them all in a colander and rinse the whole batch.

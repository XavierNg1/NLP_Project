 Before having plastic surgery, it is important to examine your reasons and motivation for plastic surgery. You can ask your friend certain questions to help him or her think through the decision to have plastic surgery. Some good questions to ask your friend include:How long have you been thinking about plastic surgery?
Did anything happen to trigger your desire to have plastic surgery?
What is your life like right now?
Why are you considering plastic surgery right now?
Can you try anything else to get the results you want?;
, Along with considering the reasons why your friend wants plastic surgery, it is also important for your friend to think about his or her expectations for plastic surgery. You can guide your friend through this process by asking questions. Ask your friend, is it your expectation that surgery will:change your life along with your appearance?
please someone other than yourself?
improve a relationship?
make it easier to get a job or make friends?
make you look exactly how you want to look?

, Being a good listener is an important trait for good friends to have.Your friend may seem to have made up her mind about having plastic surgery, but she might be struggling on the inside. One of the best things you can do is listen to her without passing judgment on what she says. As you listen, make sure that you:make eye contact and remove all distractions, such as cell phones, computers, tablets, etc.
nod and use neutral statements to show that you are paying attention.
echo what your friend says now and then to show you are listening closely.
ask leading questions to get your friend to keep talking, such as “How does that make you feel?” or “What are you going to do next?”

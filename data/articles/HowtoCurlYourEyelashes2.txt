 Fill a mug or glass with warm water, and place a metal spoon in it. Let the spoon sit in the water for 3 to 5 minutes to warm up the metal.








Don’t choose a spoon that’s too large or it may be difficult to hold comfortably against your eye. A tea or coffee spoon is usually the best size for curling.
 Take the spoon out of the water and blot it lightly with a towel. Bring the spoon up to your eye, holding it with the curved side facing outward.








It’s a good idea to test the heat of the spoon before holding it up to your eye to ensure that it’s not too hot.
 With the spoon over your eye, push your lashes back against the spoon’s curve with your fingers. Hold your lashes against the spoon for at least 10 seconds for the best curl.
 After you’ve curled your lashes, apply a waterproof lengthening mascara to help ensure that the curl stays in place all day. It helps to apply multiple coats to not only make the curl last, but help your lashes appear longer and thicker.








Use a lash comb to brush through your curled lashes if they become clumpy after you apply the mascara.

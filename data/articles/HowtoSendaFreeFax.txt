, Be aware that some websites that send free faxes will send your fax with an ad on the first page, or will require you to consent to receive advertisements over email. If you're concerned about these things happening, check the ToS.
 The website you use will ask for the number to which you wish to fax (without spaces), as well as the name of the recipient, the subject of the fax, an email address for verification that the fax was sent, and your name. Other information might be required as well.


To see if you can send a fax to a certain area, check the verification page. Type in the whole number, including the country code, area code, and number. (For example: Oxford, England - 44 1865 xxxxxx)

,, Most services will send an email to the address you provided, confirming that the fax has been sent. If you don't receive a confirmation email within an hour or two, you might want to call the person you were faxing and see if he or she has received anything.

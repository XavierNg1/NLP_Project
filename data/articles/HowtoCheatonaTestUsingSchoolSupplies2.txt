 You can do this using any sharp metal device (a compass will work). Make sure that all your notes are in small writing.
 And make sure the folder is angled properly so you can see the writing.


To avoid suspicion, tell your teacher that the folder is for another class. Make sure you have notes and paperwork inside the folder as evidence.

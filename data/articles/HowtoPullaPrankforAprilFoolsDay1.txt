 You're with a friend or sibling. And you make a little deal like 'Teach me how to cook, I'll teach you how to draw.'


Lets say you said 'I'll teach you how to draw'. So you do a little homework. They tell you to try something simple; make cookies and show them tomorrow. You say something like' I want you to paint a perfect picture of Mona Lisa.' If they're surprised or something, then say "APRIL FOOLS!";

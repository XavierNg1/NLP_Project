 Heat the pan on the stove over a burner set to medium-high. When a drop of water flicked into the pan starts sizzling immediately, it's hot enough. Crumble the beef into the pan and cook until pleasantly brown. Use your spoon or spatula to break up larger pieces.


If you're using leaner ground beef (e.g., 95/5), you can add a small amount of oil to the pan to keep it from sticking. Fattier grades of ground beef (e.g., 80/20) will make enough grease on their own. See "Tips" below for help choosing fat or lean beef.;
, Stir well so that the flour absorbs the grease and oil that has appeared in the pan from cooking the beef. You want the mixture to be as smooth and even as possible.


When the flour is completely absorbed, you will have a roux â€” a type of sauce made by cooking flour and liquid fat., Add about 1/2 of the total milk at first, stirring as you go. Keep stirring until the mixture is well combined. The gravy should gradually start to thicken as the heat evaporates the liquid.


At this point, you can add as much of the remaining milk as you want. The more milk you add, the thinner the gravy will be. When it's at the consistency you want, heat it to boiling, stirring occasionally, then remove from the heat.
 Add these dry seasonings to the hot gravy and stir to combine. Give the mixture a test taste. If you like the way it tastes, you're ready to serve.


If you think the recipe could use a little extra flavor, feel free to add more of any of the seasonings. Go slowly, stopping to taste-test often. Remember: you can always add more, but you can't take any out.
 Spoon the gravy over your food and enjoy!


Garnish with small chunks of fresh chopped onion if desired.

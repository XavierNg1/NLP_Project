 In one study, asymptomatic adults came down with the flu. They were given 1000 mg of vitamin C on an hourly basis for six consecutive doses. They then received 1000 mg three times daily as long as they were symptomatic. Their reported flu and cold symptoms were reduced by 85% compared to a placebo.Take 1000 mg of vitamin C every hour for six hours. Then take 1000 mg three times a day until you don't feel your symptoms anymore.
 Vitamin D3 is an important vitamin that stimulates the immune system. If you are not already taking vitamin D3 supplements regularly, there is a high probability that you may be deficient in vitamin D. This could be measured with 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood levels. But when a flu hits, there is no time to do this.


For adults: Take 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 on the first day you feel sick. Then take the same amount every day for the next three days. Reduce the vitamin D3 dose slowly over the next few days to 5000 IU daily.
In schoolchildren, another study showed that 1200 IU of vitamin D3 reduced the incidence of influenza by 67% compared to a control group that did not take any vitamin D3 supplement. , Coconut oil has medium chain fatty acids that have antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and antiparasitic effects without having side effects. The main ingredient in coconut oil is lauric acid, a medium chain saturated fatty acid. It inserts itself into the viral outer membrane and causes a rupture and death of the influenza virus without harming the human host of the virus.


Take one to two tablespoons of coconut oil three times per day. Mix it in warm orange juice or take it with a meal. Usually within one to two days, the virus will be eliminated. Symptoms often disappear within one day, when normally it would have taken five to seven days to recover from a flu,

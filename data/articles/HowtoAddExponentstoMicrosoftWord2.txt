 Place your cursor in front of the number or letter you want to format as superscript (an exponent), then hold down your left mouse button and drag the cursor over the text to highlight it.
 The Font dialog not only lets you change the font and point size of your text, but it also lets you format the text in a number of ways, including making it into an exponent. How you access the Font dialog depends on your version of Word.


For Word 2007 and later, click the diagonal down arrow button at the right of the Font section in the Home ribbon tab.
For Word 2003 and earlier, select "Font" from the "Format" menu.
Your highlighted text will be displayed in the Preview window.
 The text in the Preview window will appear small and raised.



In addition to representing mathematical exponents, you can use this method to represent ionic charge, which is written as raised plus or minus signs (with either a number denoting how many electrons were gained or lost or with a sign for each extra or missing electron) after the chemical symbol. Do not use superscript numbers to represent multiple atoms of an element in a molecule; for that, use subscript numbers.
Instead of typing the text you want to superscript first, you can bring up the Font dialog, check "Superscript," click "OK," and then type your text. If you do this, you must bring up the Font dialog box after typing your superscripted text and uncheck "Superscript" to turn this feature off.

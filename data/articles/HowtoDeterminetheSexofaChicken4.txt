 This is an easier and extremely common method. It will take you time to wait but it's worth it as there is less hassle. There's usually one tell-tale sign when your chicks turn six weeks old and that's the wattle and comb., Females have smaller, pale combs and males have larger combs that are bright red. Baby roosters also develop their wattles faster than the females.

Males have tails that stick up-right and you may also see them doing a particular roo dance against each over and peck one another. But female pullets also tend to peck each over to establish a pecking order so it's not so certain.

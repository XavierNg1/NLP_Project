 Have a name with no numbers unless the replace a letter such as: hybr1d pk. Then complete the tutorial island without getting attack and strength to 3. Once you are off, you can go to the the knight down the ladder in Lumbridge and obtain the 2 exp lamps. Spend them both on range. Now you can either go to barbarian village and get the other exp lamps or you can just carry on with training your range.;
, Here is a brief range guide 1-80. Please do as it says even if some parts are long. 1-10 chickens, 10-20 cows, 20-30 barbarians (level 7), 30-45 barbarians (level 17), 45-60 Minotaurs (level 27), 60-80 flesh crawlers. The 1-60 won't take long at all but then the 60-80 will take some more time.
 1-3 wind strike, 3-11 confuse, 11-19 weaken, 19-55 curse (pretty long), 55-60 high alchemy. You will mainly use bind with Mage but you will need 60 Mage to hit constantly, (trust me).
 ALWAYS USE SCIMITARS FOR TRAINING! Now, train on the same NPC's as range. But do this formula: 15str, 10att, 25str, 20att, 35str, 30att, 45str, 40att, and then all the way to 80. Make sure you do that formula.


Now you should have the following stats: 40att, 80str, 60mage, 80range, 70+hp 55-60cb! ^o^
Money making. Woodcutting! 1-15 normal trees, 15-30 oaks and 30-60 willows. once you reach 60 woodcutting you will make money fast! Go woodcut yews behind Lumbridge castle and bank at Draynor. This is truly the best place to woodcut yews! If you don't think so, try it out. there's hardly any people so you get 1/4+ of an inventory of yews in one tree and the banks isn't far away either!

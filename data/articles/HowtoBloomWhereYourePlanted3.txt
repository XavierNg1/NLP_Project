 You can bloom in small ways throughout the day by having a positive impact on others. Bringing people up rather than down improves the world around you. It also improves your own attitude, which can allow you to have the energy and attitude to thrive.Do small things to bring people up. Smile at a cashier, for example, or help someone who's lost with directions.
Try to be pleasant even if you're feeling down. For example, go into your job with the goal of being nice to everyone, even if you're having a bad day.
 Wake up every morning and remind yourself of everything you're thankful for. This will help you keep things in perspective and remind you that you're not solely defined by your circumstances. In the morning, try thinking of something you're grateful for right away. This can help you go into the day feeling positive., Remember, you can't always control your situation. However, you can learn to work with the tools you have at your disposal. Try to see opportunity for growth everywhere.For example, maybe you just graduated college with a creative writing degree and are working in a coffee shop while searching for a better job. While you may not see opportunity here, there's something you may be missing.
A low-key, part time job can provide you with the opportunity to work on your writing. You can also observe people at your work, providing inspiration for stories.
 Keep the big picture in mind if you want to bloom. If you begin feeling lost, frustrated, or unhappy, remind yourself of your larger goals. Try to see how your current situation relates. This will motivate you to get back on track and keep trying in the present.

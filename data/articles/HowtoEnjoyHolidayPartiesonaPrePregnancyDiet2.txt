 The food should not be the center of a holiday party. Your friends, family, and coworkers should be the main event. Spend your time socializing with people. This will distract you from the tempting treats being offered, and it will make the holiday season even more memorable.If you keep seeing or smelling food, you might be tempted to break your diet. As you chat to people, position yourself away from the food table., There are tons of fun games you can play at a holiday party. If there are no games planned, you can volunteer to start them. These games may or may not be holiday themed. Some games you can play include:


Charades
Holiday music karaoke
Holiday movie trivia
Board games
Card games

, If there are children at the party, you might see if you can play with them. If you don't have children yet, this can help you look forward to being pregnant with your own baby. Some great activities you can do with kids include:


Holiday MadLibs
Hide and seek
Making paper snowflakes
Decorating a gingerbread house

, You can start a chorus of people singing holiday-themed songs. If there's a stereo, you can play music on it, or you can start your own sing-a-long. Pick some songs beforehand that you want to sing, and others will chime in their favorites as well.

 You grill should be preheated to a medium-high temperature.

If using a gas grill, turn on all the eyes to a medium-high temperature.
If using a charcoal grill, stack a large pile of coals inside the grill. Wait until the flames die down and a layer of white ash can be seen over the coals.
 Cut each kohlrabi bulb into thin slices and chop each slice into tiny pieces. Transfer the kohlrabi to a large mixing bowl.

For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger.
 Drizzle olive oil over the chopped pieces and add a dash of salt and pepper. Mix well so that all the pieces are evenly coated.

You could also add other flavors and seasonings in, as well. For instance, garlic, onion, and chives all work well with the taste of kohlrabi.
 With the dull side up, transfer the seasoned kohlrabi onto a sheet of aluminum foil. Fold up the foil to form a tight packet or bundle that can hold the kohlrabi inside.

The packet needs to be sealed to trap as much heat inside as possible. Moreover, the seal should face upward as you cook to prevent any kohlrabi pieces from falling out.
 You do not need to stir the kohlrabi during this time. When done, the pieces should be tender-crisp and easy to pierce with a fork., The kohlrabi is now ready to eat.

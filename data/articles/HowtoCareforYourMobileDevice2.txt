 The locker is probably one of the most safe ways of protecting your smart phone at school (middle schoolers or high schoolers only).
 Another safe way is putting your phone away in your backpack. This is probably the most recommend thing you should do.
 Using it in class just invites confiscation, and if it's confiscated, you can't guarantee that your teacher will treat it with the same care you would.
 The more you show off your new device, the more likely it is that someone will observe it and try to take it. Even if you're not concerned about theft, it's also a good idea to be discrete to avoid an acquaintance grabbing it from you or asking to see it and then dropping it. If you really want to care for your device, keep hold of it yourself, and use it only discretely and in appropriate settings.

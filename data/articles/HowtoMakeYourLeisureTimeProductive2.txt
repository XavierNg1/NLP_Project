 Beyond the hours of 9 to 5, there are a range of networking events you can attend. Saturday brunch or evening cocktail parties may serve as the perfect backdrop to pitch a new idea or pass out your business cards.Look up networking events in your area or put out feelers at work or in your professional organization to learn about after-hours events.
 Having a strong social support group makes you more resilient to stress and even builds self-esteem. If you tend to flake on your loved ones due to school or work commitments, use your leisure time to hang out and nurture your existing friendships.Plan a movie night, game night, or ice cream social. Call up a few friends or family members you never get to see and invite them to join in on the fun. Connecting with those you love is a wonderful way to spend your downtime.
 Helping out in your local community provides you with an opportunity to connect with others, do something meaningful, and even polish your resume. Think about an area of need in your community and find out how you can be of service.You might help plan a community event, work in a homeless shelter, or pick up trash after the annual carnival.
 If you are searching for interesting ways to fill your free time, do something kind for someone else. Random acts of kindness show those around you that you care, and they make you feel good about yourself, too.

These acts can be anything, from dropping off fresh-baked muffins to your elderly neighbor or volunteering to watch your siblingâ€™s kids so they can go on a date. Make a list of fun ways you can give back to those around you, and aim to complete one random act each day.

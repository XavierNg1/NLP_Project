 A weak grip means the hands are rotated on the club handle more towards your target. If you can only see the knuckle of your forefinger on your dominant hand, you have a weak grip. A strong grip means the exact opposite, with a rotation to the side of your club further away from your target.








A weak grip can combat a hook as well as add height and backspin to the ball. It can also cause the ball to slice, and make proper swinging form difficult to achieve.
A strong grip can be very comfortable and result in good low hits, but it can also make the golfer prone to hooking.
 A looser grip will allow you to gain more precision and loose distance, which you don’t need here. Grip the club as you normally would, and pay attention to where the creases created by your forefingers and thumbs are pointing. These creases should be pointing to the left of your chin, closer to your target.


If you are right-handed, the creases should be pointing to the left of your chin.
If you are left-handed, the creases should be pointing to the right of your chin.
The creases, may also make “V” shapes. You want the point of the “V” pointing closer to your target on your short game.
 When you’re on the green you want to minimize the movement in your wrists. Move the handle of your putter back in your dominant hand so it rests on the lifeline of your palm. Grip it the same way with your other hand. Then, angle your wrists downwards.








Hold your putter with a baseball grip. You don’t need or want wrist movement here. Holding your putter with a 10 finger grip and angling your wrists down helps to keep them locked.
Your putter should be an extension of your arms and swing like a pendulum.

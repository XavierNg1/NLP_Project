 Use about a cup of water to pour into the bottom of a cooled oven with a steam clean feature. Consult your owner’s manual on the exact amount of water to use for your oven model.


Note that this method should only be used for an oven with a “steam clean” feature built in. Do not pour water into the bottom of an oven before engaging a regular pyrolytic cleaning cycle, or in an oven that has no self-cleaning feature at all.
Run a steam clean cycle after a recent food spill, and regularly, for the best results., Find the button or setting within your oven’s control panel or knobs that indicates “Steam Clean.” Some models may refer to this feature as EasyClean (LG) or AquaLift (Maytag).Turn this function on to begin the cleaning cycle.


A steam clean cycle works by heating the oven to a temperature that allows the water to steam and distribute throughout the oven, softening and loosening food particles, which are removed easily from a special enamel coating on the walls.
Because of the lower temperature, time period, and lack of chemicals of this type of cycle compared to standard pyrolytic, you can leave oven racks or even pans inside the oven during cleaning, and the oven door does not need to be locked., Allow the full steam cleaning cycle to complete before opening the oven. Wait till it has cooled to perform the rest of the cleaning process.


A steam clean cycle typically takes from 20 to 60 minutes, so it is much faster than a standard pyrolytic self-clean cycle. However, you should still expect to wait for the time allotted for the cycle by your specific machine.
Some oven models may provide a countdown that lets you know how much time is left in the steam cleaning cycle.

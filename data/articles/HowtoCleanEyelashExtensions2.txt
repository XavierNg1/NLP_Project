 After washing your lashes, gently pat your face dry with a towel, but avoid your eyes to protect your extensions. Let your lashes air dry instead. To speed up the drying process, you can wrap some toilet paper around your finger and gently blot your lashes.If you want to be especially careful of your extensions, just let your lashes sit on the toilet paper for a few seconds so the water can be absorbed.
 Set your blow dryer on its coolest setting. Next, blast your lashes for about ten seconds on each eye. Be sure to keep the dryer about arm’s length from your face. Don’t do this too often because you want to maintain the adhesive in your extensions., Close one eye. Using a clean, dry mascara brush, gently roll it over your lashes. Next, fluff out the lashes a bit with the brush. Don’t drag the brush through the base of your lashes.

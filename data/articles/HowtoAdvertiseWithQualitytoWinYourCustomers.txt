 You must grab your reader's attention. Convey your message in just a few words. The words you use must be exciting, dramatic and interesting. Question headlines work great. Use LARGE BOLD TYPE to help grab your prospect’s attention. Studies have shown that headlines in "QUOTATIONS" have done much better than those without quotations. People figure if it's in "QUOTATIONS," it must be important.;
, The second step is the sub-headline. If you have created a great headline, then it should seamlessly lead your prospect’s attention to your sub-headline. You don't want to give everything away just yet. Give them a taste, a tease if you will, of what's being offered. Your sub-headline must lead directly to the body of your ad.
 The third step is your body text. If you've done your job correctly, you have led your audience to your ad body. This is where you can thoroughly explain the details of your product or service. If this is a direct mail project, you can state your message in as many pages as you'd like. Depending on the price of your product or service, you can choose a long or short ad copy. For example, a product or service costing $29.99 may require only about 2 - 4 pages of copy. Anything over $100 will require 8 - 20 pages. If you have testimonials, use them, if not, use proven studies.
 The fourth step is your closing. This is where you clinch your deal! You want your prospects to break out their credit cards and buy whatever you’re selling. Be assertive, but don't be too pushy. NOW is the time to let them know about any free-bees, or tell them this is a "Limited Time Offer" and they must "Act Now."

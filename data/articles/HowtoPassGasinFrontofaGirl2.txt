 If you are unable (or unwilling) to pass gas silently, you can cough,use music, conversation, or the well-timed slam of a loud door to mask the sound of your noisy fart.


If you have a phone, turn up the volume and play your ring tone while you break wind.
Moving to a noisy location like a city street or a crowded room will also provide opportunities for covering your flatulence.,


This method is especially effective if the fart is of a short duration. The longer you fart, the easier it is to identify you as the culprit.
 Don’t let a girl shame you just because you farted. Look directly into her eyes as you pass gas. If she gives you a hard time about it, tell her that farting is a perfectly natural biological process. Remind her that everyone toots, and holding in gas causes bloating and discomfort., Mention that you shouldn’t have eaten that fourth burrito at lunch.
 If she seems genuinely upset or offended, it might be best to back down. Be as sincere as possible when apologizing and promise her there will be no further incidents.

 The Strategic Map can be opened by clicking the button at the lower right hand corner of the screen. It looks like two arrows that make a square as they follow each other. You can also open up this map by pressing F6 on your keyboard.;
, Click on the “New Trading Route” button located under “Trading routes.” You will then be able to name your route.
 You can name your trading route whatever you would like. It is recommended that the name describe the route your ship will be taking. For example, if you are transporting Wood from one island to another, naming the route “Wood Transport” would help identify it later.
 You can do this by clicking on the map to the left on the Trading Routes section. It will be added to the Stations section under the Trading Routes section. Click the green button (meaning to pick up) and select the good you want to transport. The default amount to be transported is 60t.


You can choose multiple goods when transporting by clicking the green button again.
 Once you have established the warehouse where you will pick up the goods, you will need to select where you want to drop them off. Click the desired warehouse on the map and then click the red button (meaning to drop off). Select which good you would like to drop off.
 Next you will have to choose which ship you want to use to transport these goods. Located under the Ships section, click the “Add Ship” button and then select your ship. The ship will automatically begin to run the route continuously.


You can quickly edit this route by simply going back to the Strategic Map and clicking on the route in the Trading Routes section.

 You'll want to be about knee-deep in the water when you mount your board, and you should stand on whichever side of the board you feel most comfortable.


Make sure the board is placed so the fin is down in the water.;
, The grip of the paddle should be aligned with one side of the board (the side closest to you) and the paddle is touching the water on the other side.
 The hand closest to your body will be gripping both the board and the paddle, which will help you maintain balance as you mount the board.
 This will allow you to place your knee on the "sweet spot," which is just about the mid-point of the board. #* If your board has a handle, the "sweet spot" will often be where the handle is integrated.
 You should now be in a kneeling position, with both knees on the board, and feel relatively stable.



Check the board positioning as you do this: If the nose end comes out of the water, you're too far back on the board, and if the tail end comes out of the water, you're too far forward. Adjust your position as necessary so your board lies as flat as possible.
 Grip the sides of the board with both hands.
 Continue gripping the board to help stabilize yourself.
 They should be hip-width apart, and you should feel relatively stable. Make sure to bend your knees slightly and keep your core centered over the board.

 Use an Ethernet cable to make the connection.;
,, Note: If you use a Windows computer, download the AirPort Utility from Apple and follow the OS X directions.


OS X - Click the Wi-Fi menu and select your AirPort new base station.
iOS - Open the Settings app, tap "Wi-Fi", and then tap your new AirPort base station.
 You can enter a Network name as well as the name of the base station. Other devices will see the network name from their list of available networks.
 Enter it again to confirm. Any device that connects to the network will need this password.
 After setting the network name and password, your AirPort base station will configure itself to allow you to connect. This may take a few moments, but doesn't require any input from you.

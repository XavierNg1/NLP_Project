 Your collar should be up and your shirt buttoned most of the way to the top. The wide end should be at least 12 inches longer than the thin end.








The wide end of the tie should be on the side of your dominant hand. So if you're right-handed, the wide end should be hanging on your right side. If you're left-handed, the wide end should be hanging on your left side.
You can button the tie all the way to the top if you want but keep the end knot loose.;
, There should be a seam located on narrow end of the tie, close to its highest point. You should cross the tie around this point.
 Move the wide end over the narrow end so they cross on the seam.Use the seam as a guiding point for where to cross the tie. You can cross a bit higher or a bit lower than the seam. Don't go too high or low!








, Pull the wide end behind the narrow end. Then, bring the wide end around to the left.
 Bring the wide end up. Now, push it through the loop around your neck.
 Use your index finger to keep a loose hold on the front of the knot and the narrow end.Pull the wide end down through this knot. Tighten the knot by sliding it up the narrow end. Don't push the knot in too tight. The knot should be loose. The four-in-hand knot is a little asymmetrical at the neck.

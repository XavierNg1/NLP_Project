 These are all popular social media sites, so create your own page for your website, and use the opportunity to make yourself known within these sites.;
, Build your list of friends and keep adding to them. Everything you post will be seen by these friends via their newsfeeds. The more friends you have, the better the chances of more targeted traffic visiting your website.
 Your friends will be more inclined to repost to their friends if there is a benefit. Many businesses post coupon information, upcoming sales, freebies, and other promotional information on their social media sites. If you make a habit of this, social media traffic will know where to go directly for these incentives.
 If there is something going on in the news that is related to your field of business, mention it as a post, and then add a link back to your website. If you are hosting an environmental or political website, then mention the latest developments on subject matters you have been discussing recently.
 You should update your page a least weekly so that your friends hear from you on a regular basis. For example, a restaurant owner can post the specials daily, or a retailer can feature a product of the week. If you are hosting a blog, post a useful article related to your subject, product or service. Direct your friends to the article by posting a link with an enticing invite on your social media page.
 With every post you publish, you are representing yourself and your website. So make sure that you are presenting yourself in the manner that builds your reputation and popularity. If your posts are uninteresting, then your friends will be inclined to remove you from their list.
 Try to lead traffic back to your website. One way you can do this is to begin a news story on your Twitter or Facebook post and add a link back to your website. If you add your link to all your posts, you will ultimately increase website traffic.

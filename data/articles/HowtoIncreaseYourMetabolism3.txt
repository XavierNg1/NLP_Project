 Studies have shown that by increasing the amount of water that you drink, you can also increase your metabolic rate by as much as 40%. This increase may be a result of your bodyâ€™s attempt to heat the water that you are ingesting, but the reason for the increase is unclear.Our bodies also often confuse thirst and hunger, so it is important to stay hydrated for that reason as well.
 Coffee has been shown to increase metabolism because of the caffeine content. One study showed that drinking coffee significantly increased the metabolic rate of both normal weight and obese subjects.Keep in mind that the metabolic effects of caffeine are small compared to other measures like exercise.Excess consumption of caffeine can also cause nervousness, insomnia, and other negative side effects., Combining green tea (even decaf green tea) with diet and exercise can improve your metabolic rate. One study showed that combining decaffeinated green tea extract with exercise created more dramatic results than exercise alone.Consider adding decaffeinated green tea extract or drinking a cup or two of green tea as a complement to your diet and exercise regimen.
 Crash diets dramatically restrict your caloric intake, which can have a negative effect on your metabolism. Even though you may experience some initial weight loss from a crash diet, crash diets ultimately slow down your metabolism and often lead to gaining more weight after the fact. Crash diets can also cause you to become deficient in some important nutrients due to the limitations that they place on the variety of your food intake.

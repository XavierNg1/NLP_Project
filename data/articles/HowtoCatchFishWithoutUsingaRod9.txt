, Leave a small opening in the middle of this causeway. This is now the only way through the causeway, via the little gap.
 Anchor it down with a rock on the inside. Keep it open with a stick or other object (a fish needs to be able to swim into it). This sets the trap for the fish to swim in. Now all you need to do is encourage fish to swim in this direction.
 If it's a lake, throw rocks as far into the center as you can. If it's a stream, beat the water with a branch or throw rocks. This is to encourage the fish to swim away from the commotion, down toward your trap.
 Go and check the trap. If there is a fish in it, quickly and carefully retrieve it and place on shore. If not, repeat the commotion until fish swim into the trap.

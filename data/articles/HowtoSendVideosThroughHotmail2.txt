 If the file is too large, you will be told that you need to add it to your OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) account first, and then share it through that service.


All Microsoft accounts come with 3 GB of storage in OneDrive for free.
 Click the "Go to OneDrive.com" button that appears when you try to attach a video that is too large.
 Click the "Upload" button at the top of the OneDrive page and select the video that you want to share. The video will be uploaded to your OneDrive account. For large videos or slow connections, this could take a significant amount of time.
 Once the file is finished uploading, return to Outlook.com and click the "Insert" button again. This time, select "Share from OneDrive". A new window will appear, allowing you to select the file you want to attach. The video you just uploaded should be at the top of the list of available files. Select it and click "Open".
 The attached video will be shared as a link to the video on your OneDrive account. The recipient can click the link to download the video to their own computer in order to watch it.

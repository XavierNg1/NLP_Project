 Men and women tend to wear different types of shorts when playing volleyball. Women’s shorts are tighter and shorter while men’s shorts are longer and looser.


Women typically wear spandex shorts. These have a four-inch inseam and resemble biking shorts.Men wear baggy shorts that reach just above the knee. These resemble basketball shorts.
 Jerseys are standard in competitive volleyball. Your team will likely provide you a jersey. Jerseys must be a solid color, and the libero must be wearing a contrasting color to the rest of the team.Women’s jerseys are tight-fitting with short sleeves. Make sure that your shirt is snug but that you can still move your arms. Try stretching and rotating your arms when you try yours on to see how well you can move.
Men wear looser jerseys with no sleeves. Make sure yours is not so loose that it can get caught in the net.
 Volleyball shoes have special rubber soles that give them extra traction on the court. Two popular brands of volleyball shoes are Asics and Mizuno.Prices for good shoes range from $70 to $150.
 Pick knee pads that fit you well and that cover your entire knee. The sleeve of the kneepad should be between 5 and 10 inches.More advanced players may want a shorter sleeve for maximum flexibility while newer players will want longer sleeves to increase their protection.

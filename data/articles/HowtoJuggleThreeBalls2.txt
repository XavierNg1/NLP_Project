 Place two balls in your right hand and the other ball in your left. If you are left-handed, reverse the instructions to fit. Only proceed with this step when you feel confident with juggling two balls.


Remember how you threw the second one when the first one was high up in the air? Now you're just throwing the third when the second one is high up in the air. Same thing. Ready? Set.
 Remember that the ball in the air should be at head height.
 At maximum height, you'll have about a second. That's plenty of time!








, Catch both balls. This is where it gets difficult -- catching and throwing -- so keep trying!









It is often helpful to roll the ball in your right hand to the front of your hand with a slight downward motion of the hand before you throw it. The outgoing ball travels just to the inside of the arc of incoming ball. You are exchanging the one in your hand for the one in the air.
 Keep practicing until you get used to the movement, then stop catching and holding the balls at the end. Don't worry about walking forward; this is normal for beginners. With practice, you will be able to perform the 3 ball juggle with your feet planted firmly in the same spot.









Continue juggling as long as you can. Increase the speed with practice. Try to make the balls look as though they are in continual motion.
Keep practicing! Juggling only improves with practice and the more you try, the less and less you will drop the balls, and the faster you will become.

 Move your oven rack to the middle of the oven and turn the broiler on. Measure out 24 dried figs (about 10 ounces or 300 g). Use a sharp knife to cut each fig down the center about three-quarters of the way. You should be able to pull the sides of the fig apart. Do this for all of the figs and put them on a rimmed baking sheet while you make the filling.Some broilers have a LO or HI temperature option. Try using the HI setting when you broil the figs. You may need to adjust the temperature to prevent the bacon from burning.
 Have 3 ounces (85 g) of goat cheese setting out until it gets to room temperature. Put it in a small mixing bowl along with the rest of the filling ingredients. Use a rubber spatula to completely combine the ingredients. You'll need to add:1 tablespoon of pesto
1 tablespoon of lemon juice, plus 1 teaspoon of fresh lemon zest
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

, Use a small teaspoon to scoop out some of the pesto goat cheese filling and place it in the middle of each sliced fig. Take 12 slices of bacon and cut them in half crosswise, so you have 24 short pieces of bacon. Wrap one piece of bacon around each stuffed fig and stick a toothpick in it, so it won't come apart. Put each wrapped fig back on the baking sheet.Ensure that you put the figs seam-side down on the baking sheet. This way, the filling is less likely to ooze out as the figs broil.
 Place the baking sheet under the preheated broiler. Broil the figs for 4 to 5 minutes so that the bacon cooks and crisps up. Carefully remove the sheet from under the broiler and use tongs to turn the figs over. Return the sheet to the broiler and finish broiling the figs for another 4 to 5 minutes. The bacon should be completely cooked before you serve the figs.You'll need to wear oven mitts when removing the baking sheet from the broiler.

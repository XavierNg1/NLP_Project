 Select a bra with pads in the cups and one with a solid underwire to provide lift and support. A plunge shape and half-cup style create the illusion of additional curviness while also providing versatile support.You can even combine these with "chicken fillets"- flesh colored breast emulators made of synthetic material that slip under your natural breast when wearing a bra to give further volume. These are available for purchase at most lingerie stores.
An estimated 85% of women wear the wrong bra size. Many stores that sell lingerie offer free bra fittings. Take advantage of this service to ensure that your bra is not only comfortable but providing the proper support. You can also avoid “back overspill” with the proper measurements.;
, Pull eyes upward and keep them there by wearing a striking necklace. Or, put on a sweater with a bejeweled or embellished neckline.


Sparkly or eye-catching embellishments on your upper-half also serve to distract from a less-than-curvy lower body.
With a minimalist outfit, a small, thin chain necklace that drapes down into your cleavage will also create the illusion of fullness.
 Choose tops with lower necklines, such as deep Vs or wrap tops, as they open up your bust line and draw attention to your face. High necklines have the opposite effect and create one block of fabric and color, resulting in a boxy appearance.To achieve this look for a button-down, without the risk of exposure, visit a tailor and ask to have darts sewn in to the lower buttons.
For added modesty, wear a camisole under your top.
 Purchase dresses and tops with fabric gathers and embellishments over the bust area. These additional fabric folds help to create volume while drawing attention upward.Beware of tops that include darts or inlaid boning that you cannot fill out naturally.

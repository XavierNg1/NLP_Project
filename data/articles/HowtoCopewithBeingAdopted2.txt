 Websites and books are available about the adoption process, and you can read the stories of people who were adopted.
 There was nothing deficient about you then, and there is nothing deficient about you now. Giving you up for adoption might have been the best thing they could have done for you.


Maybe your mother was a busy college student who didn't have time to give a baby the love and care you deserved without dropping out of school. So she gave you a better life with a different loving family.
Or your birth family was broken and dangerous for a child, so your parents decided you deserved a better chance at a safe family life.
Or you were left with a disabled father who didn't feel he could properly care for you, so he wanted you to be with a family that could.
 The adoption process is not fast or easy. You were so lovable and wanted that they felt it was worth it.
 Some people want to know, and others don't care much. If you want to know, explain how you feel. If you're worried about your adoptive parent(s)' feelings, reassure them that you still consider them your real parents.


Ask your adoptive parent(s) what they know. They may or may not have met your birth parent(s), or have records on file. At minimum, adoption agencies will have wanted your parents' medical history so that you would know if various illnesses run in your family.
Ask the adoption agency, but don't get your hopes up. Many agencies have privacy policies that will not give you information about your parent(s)' without their consent.
 You can hear for yourself the reasons why you were wanted, and everything they went through for the end goal of holding you in their arms.

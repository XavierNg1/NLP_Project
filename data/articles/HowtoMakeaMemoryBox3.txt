 You can fill the box with personal treasures that relate to a specific trip or time, or you can loosely reserve the box for any meaningful items that come into your life. This is a space for anything that you want to save. You don't need to fill the box up yet!


Fill the box with old letters, notes, and birthday cards. Fold up and save any words that people have written to you. Later, you'll read back over these words and cherish the connections that you've made.
Store photographs of special times. If you don't have any physical photos, you can print them from your computer, or you can save them to a flash or USB drive and put the drive into the box.
Keep art, broken things, and found objects. Perhaps you want to preserve the picture that your best friend drew for you, or the remnants of your favorite charm bracelet that broke, or a special rock that you found on the beach.
 As time goes by, save the meaningful things that you find or receive. Put these items into the box for safekeeping. You never know when you'll want to dig them out and relive the past.
 This can be a great way to commemorate a friendship: with items that remind your friend of shared memories. A memory box can also be a great gift to a parent or grandparent. As people grow older, they have more and more memories to look back upon â€“ and it can be very rewarding to have a lot of those memories stored in one place.


If you have a relative with Alzheimers or another memory impairment, a memory box can be a great way to help him or her keep in touch with the past., If you feel secure doing so, you can simply place the box on a shelf in your room or your closet. If you want to keep the memories a bit more secure, you might place the box in a dresser drawer, or under your bed, or in a secret compartment that only you know about.

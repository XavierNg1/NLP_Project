 All you need are some good, small stuffed toys. If possible, it would be good if you can get some related to the Easter tradition, such as rabbits and chicks, etc.
 Be sure to use safety pins and make sure it is on securely. Ask the child to stand very still while this is happening!

, They must be yes-or-no questions.


For example, they can ask "Do I eat carrots?" "Do I say quack?" etc.
 Those who guess it right get a prize, perhaps even the animal that is attached to them. Allow children to keep guessing until they get it right (you may need to end the game earlier for those who guess early and don't want the toy dangling off their back).

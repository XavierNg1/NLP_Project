 Consider how you would classify your style. Are you preppy, edgy, vintage, or athletic? Cat-eye frames would work well for a vintage style, but they might look out of place with an athletic wardrobe.


If you wear a lot of a certain color, like purple, consider wearing glasses that match that color.
For example, you may want to choose semi-round frames if you have a preppy style.
 Conservative frames are often the best choice if you are working in a serious business environment. Oval, rectangle, and almond frames work well for a professional style. Some common colors for this style are gold, silver, brown, gray, and burgundy for women.Avoid frames in bright colors or unusual shapes unless you work in a creative and/or casual environment.
 If you live a very active lifestyle, consider glasses that accommodate your needs. For example, choose glasses that have polarized lenses, or polycarbonate lenses that resist shattering. You can also choose wraparound glasses to help the glasses stay in place., Functional does not have to mean unstylish. Ovals, soft cat-eyes, and upswept rectangle frames are functional, simple, and stylish. You can add a personal touch by choosing frames with metal accents or simple patterns. Basic colors like black, silver, and gray are good choices, but you can add an edge to your style by choosing glasses in uncommon colors like plum and soft green., Donâ€™t be afraid to experiment with unique and colorful styles if you want to show that you are creative and fashion savvy. Consider modern frames that are made of metal and feature a geometric design. Or, large frames in bright colors or patterns (like a flower pattern) are great for showing off a quirky style.Fashion trends change often, and this includes glasses. Look up current fashion trends if you want to stand on-trend with your glasses.

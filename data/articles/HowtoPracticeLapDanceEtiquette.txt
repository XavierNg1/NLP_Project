 Observe and pay attention to the signs. Oftentimes, strip clubs have a no touching rule, and you have to understand that you are not an exemption.


Never abuse the stripper. Oftentimes, strip clubs have many guards and you will be asked to leave.;
, Pay attention to your clothes, breath and smell. Many venues require tucked in shirts and pants. Just because someone is a stripper does not mean that you can turn up in your track pants or shorts and smell like garbage; instead, think of it as going on a date. In return, the better you dress yourself up, the more she will be into you.


Often, people have a tendency to overdo colognes and deodorant. Don't be one of those people.
 Lap dances are pricy, so load your wallet up with cash. You won't want to be in the situation where you are pleading for a second lap dance to find that you have no money.


Dancers are cash only, however most venues have ATMs.
 Stripers aren't paid to be a therapist, so don't go on about your job or ex. Just enjoy the moment.
 Unless told otherwise, keep your hands to yourself. If you really can't resist the temptation to grab her body, ask her politely.
 It's okay to ask her to rub your private area, but asking her for role playing or for her to wear something is unacceptable. Lap dancers are just paid to dance, if you would like something more sexually exciting, hire a prostitute.


Some dancers may offer more than a dance, but don't expect more if she doesn't offer it.
 She is there to make money, so don't expect that she enjoys it. You should at least tip about 10% and remember that the more money you give her, the more you get out of it! You may also get a discount if you arrive early and pay for drinks or be charged more when sharing with a friend.

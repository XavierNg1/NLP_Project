 If you need to bring medication, baby formula, breast milk, or baby food, do not include these in your 1-quart (1 L) bag for non-essential items. However, expect these items to possibly require closer inspection by security. So pack them so they are accessible and can be easily removed before screening begins.The size of the container does not matter with essential items. So don’t worry if it is higher than 3.4 ounces (100 ml/g).
Security may also wish to inspect any accessories, such as syringes, IV bags, pumps, or milk warmers. Pack these for easy removal, as well.
 When it’s your turn to go through screening, inform the agents right away that you have medication and/or liquid containers that hold more than 3.4 ounces (100 ml/g). Also let them know if you have accessories that go along with it. Expect the agents to inspect your essential items by:Visual inspection
X-ray screening
Testing small samples

, First, keep in mind that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has concluded that liquids and medications exposed to X-rays are still safe to take afterward. However, if radiation from X-rays is still a concern for you, be aware that it is your right to refuse X-ray screenings for medication, breast milk, and baby formula. If desired, tell the agents that you don’t wish this when you present these items.Refusing X-rays may lead to other security measures. This could include a pat-down and/or a closer inspection of your other belongings.

 A fake pearl will not have any rings or or ridges around a drill hole. Put the pearls under a light and use a magnifying glass to inspect the drill hole. If the holes are smooth, then the pearls are likely fake., A string of fake pearls is usually uniform in color and size. Real pearls are formed by nature, so there will be differences in each pearl. Look at the pearls for variation in and size and color. The differences may not be dramatic, but they should ne noticeable., A perfectly round pearl is very rare and will sell at a very high price. A typical pearl may still be real, but it wonâ€™t be perfectly round. It may be shaped like an oval, or there may be a bump in an otherwise round pearl. A string of pearls is likely fake if every pearl appears like a tiny ball.

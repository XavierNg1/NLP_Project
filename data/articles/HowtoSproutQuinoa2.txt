 You need to soak quinoa for an extended period of time before you do anything else. Make sure you add enough water so that the quinoa seeds are fully submerged. The temperature should be no warmer than 70 degrees F (21 degrees C). It doesn’t need to be freezing cold, but if you turn your water faucet to as cold as it can go that’s probably a good http://www.sproutpeople.com/seed/quinoa.html </ref>temperature.
 Allow the quinoa to soak for up to 30 minutes. There’s no harm in leaving them in there a little bit longer, but try not to forget them and leave them in the dish the whole night. This may weaken and dissolve some of the quinoa grains.
 Carefully drain the excess water from the sprouter or bowl over the sink. The quinoa should remain in the bowl or the sprouter. One good way to do this is by playing the edge of a spatula in front of the quinoa seeds. The water will still pour around the edges but the quinoa will remain in place inside the bowl. If necessary, use a strainer. However, it’s simpler just to keep the quinoa in the bowl. It’s okay if a little extra water is left behind as long as it isn’t too much.
 Remember to use cool water with a temperature between 60 and 70 degrees F (or 15 and 21 degrees C). Repeat the rinsing and draining process every 8 to 12 hours. http://www.sproutpeople.com/seed/quinoa.html </ref>

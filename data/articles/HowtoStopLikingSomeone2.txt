 (Or rediscover old ones!) Reinvigorating your social life will give you an absorbing distraction, and you'll spend valuable time building up your support system. Here's how to expand your circle:


Join a new club or team. If you play a sport or have a favorite hobby, hunt down ways to practice with other people.
Volunteer your time. Check out your local hospital, nursing home, or pet shelter.
Get a part-time job. Ask around to see if anyone you know is hiring part-time help, or browse through local job postings.
 You'll barely have time to think about him/her.


Pick up a new hobby (i.e. painting, an instrument, a sport, cooking)
Organize events for you and your friends (as simple as going to the movies.)
Get more involved with your family.
Get more involved online.
 Take time to focus on becoming the person you aspire to be. After a while, you'll be too good for -- who again?


Work out. Go for a run, take up yoga, or start practicing a sport. The endorphin rush that comes from exercising will lift your mood, and you'll look better than ever!
Take a class. Have you always wanted to learn pottery, or find out more about martial arts? Now is the time!
Read up on your interests. Pick up that new novel you've been meaning to read, or spend more time catching up on the news.
 You both like the same music? Well, not anymore.


Experiment with new TV shows
Find new, up-and-coming bands (or break out your parents' records!)
Catch on to a new fashion trend -- or start your own!

, Like they say, there are a lot of fish in the sea. Remember to keep having fun. Hang out. If you put yourself in new situations, you'll find new (and better) potential interests.

 If you're trying to make money or train your wood chopping skills, you can chop your own trees before fletching. This can take an extremely long time, especially near the end when you're gathering yew and magic logs, but it is free apart from your time. For a much faster method, you can purchase the supplies from other players.;
, Fletching a bow from a log gives exactly the same amount of experience as stringing that bow.Stringing a bow is significantly faster than fletching, so this route will save you time if you purchase the strings rather than crafting them yourself. Whether this is worthwhile to you depends on the cost of bow strings and your budget.
 Visit the Gamer's Grotto and play the Stealing Creation minigame. When you have 20 points, you can purchase a Proto-Tool and transform it into a Sacred Clay Fletching knife, which requires 40 Fletching to use. This doubles the rate of your EXP gain, but will fall apart after giving 24,450 bonus experience., Find a location with at least two trees of the desired type, and a nearby bank for stashing your supplies. Here are some good options:Chop normal and oak trees east of Varrock. A grove of normal trees stands right outside the gate, alongside two oak trees.
Chop willow trees southwest of Catherby. These are scattered throughout the grove, not far from the town.
Chop maple trees in Seer's Village. These are conveniently located to the north and south of the bank, so you can easily store the items you gather.
Chop yew trees north of Varrock palace. This will be slow unless you have at least 75 woodcutting.Chop magic trees near Sorcerer's Tower, southwest of Camelot. This will take a very long time, especially if you have less than 85 woodcutting.Elder trees are extremely tedious to chop, as they are stingy with their logs and only allow 5 minutes of chopping every 15 minutes. The trees nearest to a bank are located in Gnome Stronghold (NW of bank) and Draynor Village (S of bank)., It's best to purchase or chop these in advance, or at least completely gather one type of logs before you begin fletching. If you are constantly switching back and forth between chopping and fletching, you'll waste a lot of time. Here's what you need to get all the way from 1 to 99, using the most common method:To get from Fletching 1 to 20, you'll need 564 normal logs or 321 normal logs and 243 bow strings.
To get from Fletching 20 to 35, you'll need 793 oak logs or 397 oak logs and 397 bow strings.
To get from Fletching 35 to 50, you'll need 1,990 willow logs or 995 willow logs and 995 bow strings.
To get from Fletching 50 to 65, you'll need 6,158 maple logs or 3,079 maple logs and 3,079 bow strings.
To get from Fletching 65 to 80, you'll need 20,916 yew logs or 10,458 yew logs and 10,458 bow strings.
To get from Fletching 80 to 90, you'll need 38,103 magic logs or 19,052 magic logs and 19,052 bow strings. See training, below, for cheaper options.
To get from Fletching 90 to 99, you'll need 70,596 elder logs or 35,298 elder logs and 35,298 bow strings. See training, below, for cheaper options.
Whether this is worth it depends on your skill at Stealing Creation and the speed of your fletching setup. If you enjoy the minigame it may be worth it regardless, to avoid burnout from repetitive fletching.
 Craft the following items to reach the listed level. Whenever a bow is listed, you can make them from logs, or string them:


Levels 1–5: Make arrow shafts out of 78 normal logs.
Levels 5–10: Fletch or string 154 shortbows. As with any bow, you can reduce this number by half (to 77) if you both fletch and string the bow. This is faster but more expensive.
Levels 10-20: Craft 332 shieldbows.
Levels 20-25: Create 210 oak shortbows.
Levels 25-35: Build 583 oak shieldbows.
Levels 35-40: Assemble 445 willow shortbows.
Levels 40-50: Form 1,545 willow shieldbows.
Levels 50-55: Construct 1,307 maple shortbows.
Levels 55-65: Fabricate 4,851 maple shieldbows.
Levels 65-70: Produce 4,270 yew shortbows.
Levels 70-80: Obtain 16,646 yew shieldbows. This step alone will take about 10 hours of fletching, 6.5 hours of stringing, or about 8.5 hours of fletching + stringing.
 This is the point where it gets much more expensive and/or time consuming, and can easily take you 60 hours of crafting even if you purchase all the supplies.


Levels 80-85: Collect 15,286 magic shortbows. (Or, as always, half this amount if you both fletch and string them.)

Cheaper, slower alternative: 16,968 yew shieldbows.


Levels 85-90: Secure 22,817 magic shieldbows.

Cheaper, slower alternative: 27,837 yew shieldbows.


Levels 90-95: Glean 33,847 elder shortbows.

Cheaper, slower alternatives: 37,435 magic shieldbows, or 45,670 yew shieldbows.


Levels 95-99: Hoard 36,749 elder shieldbows

Cheaper, slower alternatives: 46,589 magic shieldbows, or 56,839 yew shieldbows.
 Broad arrows (level 55+), ascension bolts (90+), and dragon darts (95+) all grant more experience per minute than bows, but since these are untradable items, this method costs hundreds of millions of gold at typical ingredient prices.

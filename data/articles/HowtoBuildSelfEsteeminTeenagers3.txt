 Suggest that your teen sit down and make a list of their positive characteristics. Ask them to think about what they like about themselves, what they think they offer other people, and what they think they are good at. Remind them not to listen to their inner critic during this time.Your teen may have trouble identifying that they have positive attributes. If they are struggling, help them come up with ideas. Ask questions that lead to them coming up with positives.
For example, you may say, “What activities do you enjoy? Are you good at that? What do your friends like about you? What characteristics do you think are your strengths?”

, Buy your teen a new notebook and encourage them to keep a self-esteem journal. This journal is their private space to write about their accomplishments, compliments, successes, new experiences, and progress. Encourage them to spend five minutes each night writing about the day.Your teen can write down positive thoughts they have or times during the day when they felt good.
Give them prompts, such as, “My accomplishment today was…,” “I had a good thought about myself when I thought…,” or “Today was good because I…”

, If your teen’s self-esteem is significantly impacting their life or causing depression and anxiety, you may want to suggest they go to therapy. Therapy can help your teen talk through issues, figure out what is causing their negative self-esteem, and how to cope and move past it.Your teen may benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

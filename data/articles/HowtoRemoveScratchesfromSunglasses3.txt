 These types of polishes and waxes work the same way on lenses as they do on other surfaces. They are often highly effective at removing scratches from sunglasses, especially lenses made from plastic. Never use any abrasive or acidic cleaners as these will damage your glasses and leave residue that's harmful to your eyes., A soft, lint-free cloth is also suitable in this situation. Don’t use any coarse materials such as steel wool, brass wool, sponges, or plastic mesh pads. These only damage your sunglasses further. , Using the soft cloth or cotton ball, rub the liquid onto the scratch using gentle, circular motions for about 10 seconds. Polish and wax can help fill in any existing scratches on your lenses.
 Make sure it’s dry, as this cloth will be used to remove the polish or wax. Using your thumb and forefinger, gently rub away any remaining traces of polish or wax from the lens.
 Place the sunglasses under a light and inspect for any remaining scratches. Put the sunglasses back on your face to make sure there aren’t any scratches in your field of vision. If the scratch is still visible on the lens, re-apply the cotton ball or cloth with the wax/polish, and gently clean the scratch again until it is fully removed.

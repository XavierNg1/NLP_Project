 You can get antiseptic mouthwash over the counter at the pharmacy. This type of mouthwash contains chlorhexidine, which can help to prevent a buildup of plaque on your teeth and gums. Only use the mouthwash as directed by your doctor or a pharmacist. Using mouthwash with chlorhexidine can stain your teeth brown so only use it occasionally.Make sure you rinse your mouth well with water between brushing your teeth and using the mouthwash. This will ensure the mouthwash works properly and does not interact with any ingredients in your toothpaste.;
, Another way you can keep your gums clean is by brushing and flossing your teeth correctly and regularly. Brush your teeth twice a day and/or after every meal. Use a soft bristle brush or an electric toothbrush. Brush each tooth 15 to 20 times using gentle, short strokes. Go for toothpaste that contains fluoride to maintain your teeth and gums., You should also floss once a day to keep plaque and tartar from building up in your teeth and gums. Use about 18 inches of dental floss, holding it tight between your thumbs and forefingers. Slide the floss up and down between your teeth. Make sure you curve around the tooth when the floss reaches your gum line. Rub the side of your tooth with the floss to remove any food or plaque at the gum line. Floss all of your teeth, including your back teeth.Try to floss after each meal so food does not get stuck in your teeth for a long period of time.
 Foods that contain sugar can end up getting onto your teeth and gums. They can then be difficult to remove, even with brushing and flossing. Avoid soft candies, toffees, taffies, and pastries. If you do eat sweets, rinse your mouth with water afterward or brush your teeth. Do not let these foods sit on your teeth or gums for a long period of time.Make sure you have a lot of foods high in calcium in your diet, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese. Calcium is good for your teeth and your overall dental health.

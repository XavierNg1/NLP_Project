 Be aware that once the holes are made, they cannot be unmade.
 Your parents might not want holes added to the toy's ears. Some soft toys are valuable collectors items, which will become less valuable if you make holes in their ears. There may also be a risk of tearing the ears, especially as time goes on the toy wears or you put earrings in that are too heavy.

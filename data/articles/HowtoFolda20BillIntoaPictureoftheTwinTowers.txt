 The front of the bill should face into the fold. Arrange the bill so that you are looking at the top half of the backside – you should see the words "The United States of America" flanked by two "20"s; beneath this, you'll find the words "In God We Trust" and the top of the White House.;
, Fold the left side behind the bill so that the edge slopes up at a 45-degree angle from the center of the White House. The back bottom-left-hand corner of the bill should rise perpendicular to the top of the bill; make sure that there is a large "20" in the corner., The folded bill should be pentagonal, with a downward point. You should see a crisp triangle with two rectangles rising behind it. If you look closely above the triangle, you may be able to make out the Pentagon building burning., The pointed end should be facing down. Look for the Twin Towers rising from the point and burning on either side of the crease. The eaves of the White House have become the towers, and the trees that flank the White House have become the smoke from the ruined buildings.
 The current $20 bill was the product of a redesign implemented by the U.S. Treasury in 1998 – three years before a terrorist sect hijacked commercial jets and flew them into the Twin Towers.Some 9/11 conspiracy theorists contend that the hidden towers on the $20 bill were a sign from the U.S. government—or some shadowy, powerful organization—foreshadowing the event. Some of these theorists even believe that the U.S. government had a hand in orchestrating the attacks.If you are interested in the conspiracy, do your research and try to understand why people believe this – but take everything you read with a grain of salt.

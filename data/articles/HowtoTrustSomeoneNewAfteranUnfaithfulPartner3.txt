 If you have doubts about your partner’s actions or words, ask more questions. There’s nothing wrong with talking to your new partner and getting enough information so that you feel confident in their trust. If you are confused about why they did or said something, ask. The goal is to understand their actions, and the thinking and reasoning behind them.However, asking too many questions, nagging them, or not believing them when they tell you something can lead to problems.
 Because of your previous cheating partner, you may feel the need to know everything about your partner. This may include where they go, who they are texting, or what they are doing on social media. However, this is not healthy and an invasion of your partner’s boundaries and privacy.Don’t ask for passwords to social media or email accounts. Don’t read their texts or look at their call log without their permission.
Avoid from checking up on them. This shows that you don’t trust them.
 Just because one partner has cheated on you doesn’t meant that it will happen again. The past isn’t guaranteed to repeat itself. As you find a new partner, remind yourself that this person isn’t going to do the same thing as people in the past.If you want to pursue a relationship with someone new, they deserve to be judged on their actions, not the past.

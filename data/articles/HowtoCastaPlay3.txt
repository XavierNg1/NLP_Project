 You want players who acted the role with emotion, expression, and engagement, not just those who read off the script. Good actors should be able to clearly enunciate their words, express emotions with their face and body, and convey the motivations of their characters. They should speak naturally, if a bit slowly, and they should not over-emphasize their words or actions., There is no such thing as a perfect actor. If a potential actor makes a mistake during the audition, note how they react. If they keep going without stopping, it is a sign that they are a professional. You may still want to cast them. If they become flustered, apologize, or ask to start over, it may be a sign that they will not be able to gracefully recover in front of an audience., Some roles require not just a good voice but strong facial expressions, musical talent, dancing, or stunt work. For example, if an actor can sing but not act, they may not be right for a lead role.
 People without lead roles tend to drop out. Be sure to cast enough understudies for each role. Some understudies can fill in for multiple minor roles.
 If you had a few potential actors for a role, you can call them back for a second audition. Once you have decided who gets the part, you can call them to let them know or you can post the list in a public place (such as a school bulletin board or outside the community theater).

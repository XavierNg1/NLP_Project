 With this style, you'll mix Indian and Western styles by wearing leggings or jeggings instead of a petticoat, and a clubbing style or other fancy top instead of a choli. Again, be sure to have your shoes on before you start wrapping.
 Begin pleating down the long side of the sari until you have a decent sized section of pleats.
 Tuck the pleated section into the waistband, centered below your navel, such that the rest of the sari is coming from the innermost pleat and to the left. Then tuck along the waist further, until it reaches your spine or just to your right side.
 Switch to and pleat the other end of the sari as normal, across the short side.
 Pass the shoulder section behind you and then wrap it so that it passes from your right hip and then over your left shoulder.
 Adjust the hang of the sari so that a deep U is created at the right hip and the shoulder pleats hang at a level that pleases you.
 Pin it at your shoulder to keep the sari in place, as well as anywhere else you need to in order to get the drape you want. Enjoy your new sari style!

 Yes, like you're using the restroom. Hold your breath while trying this a few times until you get used to the feeling. Don't over-do it.;
, Hiss like a snake and try to do it from your diaphragm. Try doing this as long as you can or until you run out of air.
 Practice letting out a little bit of breath at a time. At first, it'll sound like you're grunting, as you breathe in push your stomach out to have more air for belting a note.
 Keep trying different methods of letting the air out. You don't want to release too much air, or you'll be off no use on stage.
 To distort the scream, just do like when you burp, but without burping; just pushing air constantly through the throat.
 Use your diaphragm, and feel where your throat is straining to control the pitch. The wider your mouth, the easier it is to scream high. The more round you make your mouth, the easier the lows come.
 The best way to learn is to scream harmonies with your favorite bands. I say harmonies because you won't sound like other screamers yet, especially not good ones. If you're screaming harmonies, you can hear your own voice and learn how without getting discouraged because you don't match the lead singer's voice.

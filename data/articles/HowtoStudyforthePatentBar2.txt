 Getting a bachelor's degree in a recognized scientific or technical discipline is one of the primary ways a person becomes qualified to take the patent bar exam. The person will have to prove to the licensing board that she has the required knowledge to take on patent law.Earning the equivalent to a bachelor's degree in a non-US university is also permissible.
There is an exception if your degree is in computer science. Your degree must be accredited by the Computer Science Accreditation Commission (CSAC) of the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board (CSAB), or by the Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).
 A copy of your diploma or the transcript will not be sufficient. You'll need to make sure that the transcript comes directly from your university program.


You can get a transcript by calling or emailing your university.
There is usually a fee associated with requesting this service.
 If your bachelor's degree is in an area of study other than the ones above, you may still qualify for the patent bar. To establish that you possess sufficient scientific and technical training, you must have earned a minimum number of semester hours in certain courses. Usually, this means about 2 years worth of coursework.

Semester hours must be in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology and related fields. Only courses listed for majors in these disciplines are accepted.
You may also choose to take the Fundamentals of Engineering test. If you pass this test, you may have a degree in any field, and still qualify to take the patent bar.

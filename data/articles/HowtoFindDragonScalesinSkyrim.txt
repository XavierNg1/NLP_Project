 At the beginning of the game, you won’t immediately start fighting and killing dragons. You need to play through the main story line first and complete the initial main quests.


The “Dragon Rising” quest will mark your first encounter with a dragon, with you having to kill it and absorb it’s Dragon Soul. Only when you complete this quest will you unlock the dragons in the game.
After you kill the dragon, approach its skeleton and search its remains by using the Interaction button. A dragon will normally give 1–6 scales once you defeat it.
To defeat a dragon, simply attack it with your weapon or spells until its life point reaches zero.;
, Fast travel to Rorikstead (west of Whiterun), and at the top of a hill there, you’ll find an Akatosh shrine. Here you can get a single piece of Dragon Scale. This scale can be acquired even if you haven’t unlocked the dragons yet in the game.


The scale in the shrine spawns back every once a week, so if you have patience, you’ll have enough Dragon Scales for an armor even before you unlock dragons.
 If you don’t like waiting, you can always cheat your way to getting items. Cheats will vary depending on the platform you’re playing Skyrim on:


For PC—While in-game, press the tilde key (~) to open the console window. On the console window, type in “player.additem 0003ada3 ” (where 0003ada3 is the dragon scale’s item code). Press Enter, and you’ll have the Dragon Scales in your inventory.
For Consoles—Talk to the Steward of Riften’s Jarl and ask for work or jobs. You’ll be ordered to carry out jobs of killing bandits or dragons alternately. If you kill a dragon for this job, that dragon can respawn, and you can kill it as many times as you like, but you won’t get a Dragon Soul.

 Don't plan it all at once. That will cause the writing to become boring and you will want to write something new. Jot down and edit new ideas when you get them - don't be afraid to cut out a whole section entirely.;
, Create a notebook just for the unwanted but great ideas, that way you can look at what you wrote during future writings and draw your inspiration from efforts you've already realized.
 Create a series of stories. Maybe even write a story with more than one book--that way you can put all the short stories together to make a large book.
 There's nothing worse than finding that you've used two identical events in two different chapters, which make your story seem boring and unimaginative.
 Don't be hesitant to edit your story. Just keep old copies in a separate document in case you want to return to it.

 Before you hit the road, make sure that you are seated in a way that's going to be comfortable for a few hours. You won't necessarily have the chance to take a break right away and you can only make so many adjustments while the car is moving.


If you're the driver, this means positioning your mirrors, seat, and steering wheel correctly.The driver's seat should be high enough that your hips are at the same level as your knees and moved forward enough so you can depress the brake and gas pedal without lifting your back. The steering wheel should be close enough that you don't have to fully extend your arms to reach it.If you suffer from motion sickness, try to choose a seat that experiences the least amount of motion. This is usually the front seat., A big source of discomfort during long car rides is the way a seatbelt can dig into your neck and stomach. Your seatbelt should be snug against your body, but not so tight that it causes you pain.


Some cars come equipped with seat belts with adjustable height. Adjust the height of your seat belt so that it passes over your shoulder, between the edge of your shoulder and the base of your neck.If you find that your seatbelt cuts into your neck, try using a seatbelt cover or pad. They come in a variety of materials, from sheepskin to memory foam, and they can really help you feel more comfortable on your drive.
 This is particularly important for passengers. You might have to compromise on leg room, especially if you're seated in the back seat and there's someone in front of you.


If you're sitting in the backseat, wait to get in until after the person sitting in front of you adjusts their seat. This way you can see how much leg room you're starting with and decide if you need to ask your co-passenger to move their seat up. Doing it this way also prevents the chair in front of you from slamming into your knees once your co-passenger gets in.

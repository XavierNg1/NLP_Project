 Stick with what you know if you like or try something typically Kiwi. If you want to ease yourself in gently to Kiwi tastes, order some L&P - Lemon & Paeroa to drink. You will probably like it if you like Sprite. Don't be surprised by the Chocolate Fish that may accompany your coffee or Hot Chocolate. New Zealand cafes sometimes serve this uniquely kiwi confection with hot drinks.

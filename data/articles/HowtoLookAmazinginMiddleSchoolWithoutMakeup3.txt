 Wear clothes that make you feel good. If you dress how you want to (but still follow your school’s rules and your parents’ rules), you will look and feel amazing. Go to your favorite stores and get clothes that you like and you are comfortable in.
 If you are struggling to figure out what clothes you want to get, you can look for fashion inspiration. Movies, television shows, magazines, style blogs, and Pinterest are full of fashion inspiration., You might not have a say in what you get to wear to school because you have a uniform. Remind yourself that everybody has the same thing on! So if you don’t feel like you look your best in a uniform, remember that everyone probably feels the same way.


If you are allowed to, add accessories like jewelry, fun socks, unique shoes, headbands, and hair ribbons to make your uniform stand out.

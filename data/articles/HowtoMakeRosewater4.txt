 You will be crushing one pile first, and using the other one later.
 As you crush the petals, they will release juice; you will be using this juice to make your rosewater. You can also rub the petals against a strainer; simply place the strainer over a jar, and scrub the petals across the mesh using the back of a spoon.
 You can also use a glass jar or bowl. Leave the rose water and petals in the bowl for a few hours; this allows the liquid to become even more saturated.
 Stir the fresh petals through the crushed ones. Cover the bowl and let it sit undisturbed for 24 hours.
 Don't use metal pot; this will react with the oils.
 Place the saucepan on the stove and set the heat to low. Bring the rose petals to a simmer. Once you start to see bubbles, remove the pot from the burner.
 You can also use a coffee filter or a muslin cloth. Keep doing this until there are no more specks of petal in the rosewater.


If you wish to use the rosewater as a toner, then dilute it with some distilled water until you get the strength you like.
 The heat of the sun will help draw out the natural, beneficial oils.
 Use the water within one week, or it will expire.

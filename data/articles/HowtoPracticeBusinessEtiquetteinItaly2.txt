 Italians judge people by their appearance and form impressions based on how well you are dressed. No amount of wishing this weren't so will change it, so make it easy on yourself by conforming; after all, good clothes will give you confidence in a business setting, so it will help you too. Make sure you are adequately dressed up for any business occasion in which you're interacting with Italians. Some basic suggestions include:


For men: wear dark colored conservative business suits.
For women: Wear conservative clothes.
Accessorize yourself. Keep this simple but elegant. One expensive piece says more about you than lots of jangling cheap baubles.
Wear perfect shoes in excellent condition. Shoes are something that will be noticed and will form part of the overall impression of you.

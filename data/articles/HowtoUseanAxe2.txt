Place the small piece of wood you want to cut on a chopping block.
Lower yourself onto 1 knee next to the chopping block.
Use 1 hand to steady the wood you will chop.
Hold the axe's grip with the other hand.



Swing the hatchet down to the wood. Bend at the elbow to swing. Keep your wrist and hand straight.
Bring the axe down to 1 point on the wood at a 45-degree angle.
Alternate bringing the axe down onto the right and the left sides of the targeted area on the wood. A V will emerge in the wood.
Keep your eyes on the target area on the wood as you swing.
Chop the wood until you have cut it into 2 pieces.
 Sweep the wood chips off of the chopping block with your hand. You can use the chips as kindling.

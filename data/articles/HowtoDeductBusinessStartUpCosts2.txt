 Under previous tax laws, the IRS required all taxpayers with business startup costs to decide whether to deduct the appropriate amount in the first year or amortize over a period of years. Following the passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the IRS makes the assumption that taxpayers will want to take the deduction in the first year if they can. Once you make the decision, you can't revoke it.You will have to file IRS Form 4562 only if you decide to amortize the costs over a longer period of time rather than deducting them in the first year.
 Before deciding whether or not to deduct business startup costs in the first year, you need to determine approximately how much revenue you expect to earn in that time period. If you don't have a large initial income, you may want to stretch out deductions over several years to avoid a large tax bite as soon as you start making money. Consult your tax adviser before making a decision.If your business is organized as a corporation or partnership, only the corporation or partnership can make the decision, not an individual shareholder or partner.
 If you choose to amortize your costs over time instead of deducting them in the first year, you need to file a statement with your tax return that describes the business, when it began, the nature of each startup cost, and the amortization period you'll use. You must also file Form 4562.If you are deducting startup costs, you can report them on Schedule C, E, or F of Form 1040, depending on the nature of the startup costs. For specific instructions, see IRS Publication 535, Business Expenses.

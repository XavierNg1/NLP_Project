 The first step into becoming better at Hardcore Search and Destroy is to play it constantly! Learn where people go, at about what time they get there, and so on. Do not play regular mode with the goal of being good at hardcore mode. The two are completely different.;
, The second step is creating good, effective classes that offer strategies that will not only get you kills, but that can help the team win as well.
 The third and final step, which is sometimes hard for most people, is being a lone wolf and taking all the kills for yourself! It cannot be stressed enough how important these two things are. Using teamwork will not get you to this result.

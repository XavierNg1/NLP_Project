 Use heavy duty scissors, tin shears, or another heavy duty cutting tool to cut the headphones directly in half. Make sure they are cut in half because you need the symmetry to make your look work.Find vintage headphones at your local thrift store or online.
 Purchase some metal utilitarian bookends from your local dollar store and spray paint them. Choose a colour that suits the colour of your headphones or you may also spray paint your headphones the same colour for a monochromatic look.Allow your spraypaint several hours to dry. Make sure to apply your spray paint evenly. You may want to practice against some scrap pieces of board to get use to the paint distribution.
 Take each half of the headphone and set it on its own separate bookend. Take note of where the natural points of contact are and apply a few drops of glue to these areas. Press and hold the headphones in place as your wait for the glue to dry.Work on one side of the headphone at a time for convenience. You donâ€™t want to apply too much glue and make a mess. Use a clean swab to wipe off any excess glue after you have pressed down on your headphones.

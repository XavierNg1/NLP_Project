 There are many different types of ways that you can fill your mooncake. Besides the traditional mooncake, with lotus seed or red bean paste and a salted egg yolk in the middle, you can give these variations a try:


Five kernel filling, which consists of five different types of nuts and seeds, which can vary but can often include walnuts, pumpkin seeds, or peanuts
Jujube paste, which is a paste made from the jujube fruit
Mung bean paste or black bean potato paste
No egg in the middle, only filling like red bean paste
Fruit filling, such as melon, pineapple, and lychee.
Seafood (such as abalone or shark), This is a different way to make mooncake dough. You should mix together 100g of glutinous rice flour, 90g sweet icing, 30g shortening, and 50g cold water, adding the water gradually. You can also color this dough with food coloring, if you want to. This dough is different than normal mooncakes because they are softer, almost like mochi., You donâ€™t have to use a traditional Chinese mooncake mold. You can find molds online or in cooking stores that have creative, modern patterns. You should also mold your mooncakes into different shapes to fit these different molds.

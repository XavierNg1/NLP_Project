, If you're making your own pizza dough, consider making it before you try to make your pizza. Do this by mixing together sugar, yeast, and warm water. Add flour and knead the mixture. Let it rise for one hour at room temperature, or five hours in the fridge. Cut your dough in half and knead each one separately. Gently toss the dough --- if you tear it, just knead it again and start over.
 Spread the sauceÂ by lightly pushing the bottom of the ladle into the sauce, spreading it across the pizza.
 On top of that, sprinkle some coconut flakes. Add another layer of mozzarella, and another layer of coconut.


By the time the layers of cheese and coconut are at least half an inch tall, it may try to collapse. To avoid collapse, spread sauce across the outside of the white layers, which should prop up the layers. You can also gently squeeze mozzarella around the outside layers of the white. That should keep the pizza firm and steady.
 A few popular toppings are:

Grated cheese (mozzarella, Romano, Parmesan, goat cheese or some combination)
Sliced pepperoni
Chopped onions
Green peppers
Sausage
Bacon or bacon bits
Chicken chunks
Olives (Black, green, or stuffed)
Mushrooms
Ground beef
Ham pieces
Pineapple slices
Basil
Roasted garlic
Barbecue chicken

, Make sure you wear oven mitts so you don't burn yourself! Let the pizza cook for about 20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese has melted., Enjoy!

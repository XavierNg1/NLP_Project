 Windshield wipers typically have three different settings: slow, medium, and fast. If the rain is light, select the slow speed. If the rain is heavier (and your visibility is poorer), select a faster speed.If you have a rear windshield wiper, activate it, too.;
, The windshield wiper consists of two parts: the rubber wiper insert that swipes across the windshield and the metal blade that actually holds it. Check your wiper inserts regularly for stiffness or cracks, and replace them if you detect any.Most windshield wiper inserts will need to be changed at least once every three years to improve visibility in rain.Consult your owner’s manual or an auto parts store for information regarding the type and size of wiper blades you need.
Generally, wiper inserts can simply be slid into and out of the metal blade itself.
If you regularly park your car outside, you’ll probably have to replace your windshield wipers more often than if you park in the garage.
 If your wiper blades are rusty, bent, or corroded, replace them, too. Use high-quality wiper blades, preferably ones coated with a rain repellent.If there are areas of your windshield that do not get properly wiped when you use your wipers, you’ll know that the wiper is bent or applying uneven pressure to the windshield.
Generally, wiper blades can simply be unsnapped from the metal arm that holds the blade, then a new blade can be snapped in.
Consult your owner’s manual or your local auto parts store for information regarding the sort of wiper blades you need.

 A list of what you need is provided by scrolling to the end of this article, under Things You'll Need. In terms of the stool, this could be wood or plastic but check that the glow-in-the-dark paint is suitable for the surface.

For a bit of fun, this article sidestepped human-made stools and chose a tree stump instead. If you use a tree stump, check that it is clean, as in next step.;
, Whether you need to clean, sand or simply dust off the stool, make sure the stool is prepped and ready to receive a few coats of paint.


Sand down any sharp parts if using wood, or remove old screws, etc., that might be sticking out.
 This will avoid staining the ground or work surface.
 You can simply cover the entire stool in the same color, or you could get more creative. For example:


Write each stool owner’s name on the underside of each seat. Or, choose a different color paint for each stool, as a way of personalization.
Add ladybugs, frogs, bees or other cute designs that are simple to paint.
Ask children to paint on their own interesting design. This can allow them to express their artistic selves freely.
, Depending on where you paint the stool, (heat or humidity add on to dry time), this could take up to 24 hours. Again, read the manufacturer's suggestions before assuming it's dry.
 If necessary, add a second coat of paint. The color should really pop, so add another coat of paint if it doesn’t have a vibrant appearance from the first coat.
, If this is outdoors, use a spotlight or use lamps with extension cords (tape down any cords that cross walking areas, to avoid tripping). Then turn off the light and the stools should glow.


Follow the manufacturer's instructions for any deviation from this method.

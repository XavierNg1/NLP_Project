 This is a silly yet effective method for a prank call that will instantly confuse the person you're calling -- and annoy him or her more than a little bit. Here's how you do it:Restaurant employee: "Hello?"

You: "Hi, I'd like the recipe for your chicken enchiladas, please."

Restaurant employee: "Excuse me?"

You: "I said can I have the recipe for your chicken enchiladas, please? I want to make them tonight."

Restaurant employee: "I'm sorry, sir, but we can't give that information out."

You: "Come on! I'm really hungry."

Restaurant employee: "If you want our chicken enchiladas, you'll have to order them."

You: "No way! They're way too expensive!"

, This one is simple. Act flustered when the restaurant won't give you the food you want. Just follow the steps:Restaurant employee:: "Hello?"

You: "Hi, I'd like to order some egg drop soup and beef fried rice."

Restaurant employee:: "I'm sorry, but you must have the wrong place. This is Bruno's -- we're an Italian restaurant."

You: "I know who you are, but I'm having a craving for some egg drop soup and beef fried rice."

Restaurant employee: "That's not on the menu."

You: "What do you mean, it's not on the menu? What kind of a racist are you? This is unbelievable!"

, This one is easy -- just call your local pizzeria and order a large pepperoni pizza to the home of someone you don't like. The person will be flustered and confused when the pizza delivery man shows up at his door.

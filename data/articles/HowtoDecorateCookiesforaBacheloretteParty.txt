 Look through your cookie cutters and see if you have wedding-themed cookie cutters, such as a wedding gown, an engagement ring, a tiara, or a wedding cake. You may prefer to make more "adult"-themed cookies, such as margarita glasses, bras, etc. If you don't own any of these cookie cutters, consider buying them or borrowing from a friend.;
, Buy or make sugar cookie dough. Once made, roll out the dough using a rolling pin. Press the cookie cutters into the dough to form your cookies.
 Once all the cookies have been cut, put them on a cookie sheet and bake as the recipe directs (or until they're golden brown). Once they're done, put them on a cooling rack and let them cool completely.
 Divide the royal incing into three bowls. Use food colouring to make each bowl of icing a different colour. You may want to use the bride-to-be's favourite colours, the wedding colours, or colours that are relevant to the shape of the cookies (ie: an engagement ring would be yellow/gold (the band) and white (the diamond).
 Ice the cookies with one colour of icing using a butter knife or an offset spatula. Allow the icing to dry completely so as not to smudge it.
 Fill up a pastry bag with a different colour of frosting. Use a fine tip to outline the cookies and create details. Some suggestions would be rosettes, flowers, names, initials, etc.

 In Chasing Cars, this chord progression is used the whole way through. It uses the "A" chord for two bars, the "E" chord for two bars and then the "D" chord for two bars. As long as you can keep this pattern up, you can play the song.
 This song is extremely simple and doesn't require any vigorous strumming or skill. After learning all of the chords, you need to learn the actual song. Chasing Cars only has two parts, a verse and a chorus. Listen to the song to see how they both work.


The verse. Keeping the A, E, D chord progression, pick the third string and then the first string over and over. You should hear the riff that is played throughout the song. This riff is also played during the first chorus.
The chorus. Instead of picking the notes like you do in the riff, just strum the A chord, then the E chord and then the D chord. Down strum on every beat, don't miss any out. Remember that the song is counted like this: "1&2&3&4&" and strum on all of the beats. Try to make the upbeats' strum louder than the downbeats' strum to add dynamics.

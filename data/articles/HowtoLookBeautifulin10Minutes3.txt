 Bronzer is a great way to look like you just came back from a tropical vacation and it’s very easy to apply quickly. Use a fan brush to apply bronzer to your cheekbones, hairline, side of your nose and the crease of your eyes.Do not go too heavy on the bronzer or you’ll look like you have a bad fake tan.
Buy your bronzer at a makeup store where an employee can help you pick out the correct color for your skin tone.
 If you need to look awake in a hurry, use a freshly sharpened nude pencil and run it along the inner rim of your eyelid. Keep your lines very thin by applying the smallest amount of pressure to the tip of your pencil.To make your eyes appear bigger and farther apart, only line the lower eyelid ¾ of the way.
Blend the eyeliner carefully, making sure to blend upward and side to side, but never down.
 If you know you’re the kind of person who tends to run short on time and motivation in the morning, beef up your nightly beauty regimen. Try sleeping with a moisturizing mask on so your skin looks fresh and dewy in the morning.Keep makeup remover on your bedside table so you have no excuse to go to bed with your makeup still on.
Wash and braid your hair at night, so in the morning, you have easy, loose waves.

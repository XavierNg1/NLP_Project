 Your villager population should be exceeding 80, ideally reaching 100. Roughly 30 should be on gold, 25 on wood, 20 on stone, and 25 on food. As food isn't one of the requirements for the wonder, you can create as many villagers as you would like to (not that many of them are going to be particularly useful).
 Since the objective one you get into the Imperial Age is to get 1000 of wood, gold, and stone, upgrading of any kind is discouraged.

The point of upgrading is to provide a long-term advantage for your villagers. The villagers work more efficiently, but it does not easily provide a short-term solution to any resource shortage. Because the wonder needs to be built as soon as possible, as the game goes on, upgrading becomes less and less effective.
 Have as many of your villagers build the wonder. There is enough space so that about 40-50 villagers are able to build it simultaneously. If a bunch of villagers are just standing there, unable to find space where there is some, select them and click next to the place where there still is space. Your other villagers can do whatever they would like to. Double click any villager in the middle of your city to select the most villagers at once.


There is nothing else to do other than wait for your villagers to complete the wonder and to hope that you build it first (in a close race)!

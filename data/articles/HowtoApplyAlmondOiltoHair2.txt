 Start with dry hair that you've combed until it's sleek. Almond oil is particularly good for thick, dry hair or hair that has been damaged by the sun or dyes. It also helps define curls.
 Just a few drops, less than half a teaspoon of almond oil, should be enough to coat your hair. You don't want to go overboard, or your hair will end up looking oily for the rest of the day.
 Start about halfway down your hair shaft, and run your fingers through to the tips. Coating the bottom half of your hair with almond oil will tame flyaways and frizz and give your hair a sleeker look.


Start apply it too close to your roots, or your hair will look oily.
 Now that you've given your hair an almond oil treatment, style it any way you choose. Apply more almond oil throughout the day as necessary.
 Using almond oil is a great way to protect your hair from dryness and split ends. Put a few drops on your fingers and apply the oil to the very tips of your hair a few times a day to keep your hair strong and beautiful.

 Just twist a round end on your wire to blow the bubbles through. You can even make it heart-shaped, square or use other shapes if you're clever enough to bend it well.
 To make a bubble wand, just round the triangular loop out into a circle (not really necessary, but it looks better).


Shape the hook of the hanger into a handle.
Wrap with tape if desired.
Use pipe cleaners to help maintain the bubble film in the loop. Wrap the pipe cleaners around the wire loop. You'll want roughly one wrap of pipe cleaner per inch (2.5 cm) of loop wire. At the end of the pipe cleaner, fold about a quarter of an inch (6 mm) of the cleaner sharply into a hook using needle-nose pliers. Do the same to the next pipe cleaner, hook the hooks together and crimp with the pliers. Keep wrapping until the entire loop with a helix of pipe cleaners. Secure all ends by crimping together as before. The pipe cleaners form a reservoir which supplies plenty of bubble juice to the growing bubble. With a little practice, big, quivery, impressive, ten-inch-or-so (25 cm) bubbles will form.

 You can sometimes find it labeled as "elastic ribbon." You can buy it online and in fabric stores. It is a smooth elastic with a crease down the center. It comes in all sorts of colors and patterns, including glitter., Something between 8 and 10 inches (20.32 and 25.5 centimeters) would be ideal. The thicker your hair is, the longer you'll need to cut it., Bring the narrow ends together until they match up. Make sure that the patterned side is facing out. If you are using a solid-colored ribbon, make sure that the shiny side is facing out.
 Holding both of the ends together, fold them into a loop. Pull the ends through the loop. Make sure that the elastic is the size you want it to be, then gently tug on the ends to tighten the knot., Your elastic ribbon hair tie is essentially done. If you want a nicer touch, cut the ends above the knot at an angle. Seal the ends by holding them close to a flame.

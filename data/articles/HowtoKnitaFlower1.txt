 Create a foundation by casting a total of 56 beginning stitches onto one of the knitting needles.


See the “Tips” section of this article for more information about casting on stitches.;
, Work one knit stitch across the each cast-on stitch of your foundation.


Check the “Tips” section for information about completing the knit stitch.
 Knit one stitch, then bind off five stitches, leaving the last of these stitches on the right needle.


Repeat this procedure until you reach the end of the row.
 Use scissors to cut the yarn, leaving a tail measuring approximately 8 inches (20 cm). Tightly pull this tail through the remaining loops.


Make sure that this tail extends all the way through all of your remaining stitches before pulling it. As you pull the yarn, the shape of the flower should draw together.
As you pull the thread through the last loop on your needle, you'll also tie off the work.
 Trim down any yarn tails to a length of 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5 cm). Weave these tails into the stitches using a yarn needle.
 Use your fingers to push each petal through its corresponding hole. Do so as needed until all petals face the same direction.


The finished flower will be roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter.

 If you don't have teleports, a mounted Amulet of Glory, a lit gilded altar, a large dungeon, a throne room, or even fully functional skilling rooms like workshops or kitchens, you may not get very many guests. It also helps to have many different kinds of rooms exactly where people need them.;
, Many times, people have prepared for the greatest house party ever, but no one was able to attend due to this tiny little detail.
 If they ask for free food, you better get your butler to make some chocolate cake. You must be a good host by entertaining your guests.
 You should only hire players that do not auto type if you want to advertise for short periods of time, but if you want an hour-long house party, you may have to consider the rule-breaking auto typists. Sad, but true.
 Other players can't come in if you aren't home, and no one can be in there if you are logged out.
 Perhaps a PvP fest in the dungeon? Maybe a party in the throne room? Either way, plan it out.
 If everyone is at your g altar, keep the burners lit. Direct people to the portals or glory tele. If people come just to leave, so be it.
 Friends can help you run a party, and they make things more exciting!

, They may just have a better house than you do! The pleasure doesn't have to be all yours.

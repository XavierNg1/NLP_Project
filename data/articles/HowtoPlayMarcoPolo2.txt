 Blind tag, for lack of a better term, played in the pool, is like Marco Polo, except the people not it are encouraged not to make noise. The game should stay in the shallow end. If you can, tie a line to separate the deep end of the pool from the shallow end of the pool.
 How long will the "it" person have to count for before the game can start? Does it count as "tagging" if the person who is "it" tags the person with his or her foot? Can the players who are not "it" go out of water at all, or do they have to stay in the pool?








, You can randomly choose, you can all shout, "1, 2, 3, not it!" or you can let someone who wants to be it go first. It doesn't matter who starts, and chances are, everyone will get a turn.
 Typically, the person should count to 10. He or she can also count above water if that's best. When the counting is over, the fun can begin! The other people should use this time to assume a tactical position, not cornered, but not too open, and as far away from "it" as possible. Unlike in Marco Polo, there is no shouting or talking, and the people who are escaping "it" should try to be as quiet as possible.
 Since the game will be quiet, the person who is "it" should try to pick up on where people are by the sounds they make in the water. He may also hear people randomly giggling or breathing close by. It's hard to stay completely quiet in the water! The person should just be careful not to move around too fast, and should keep his arms out in front of him, to avoid running into walls.









Once someone is tagged, the new person who is "it" can count to ten and start the game all over again. The fun can continue for as long as you want. It's best played when there's no one else around -- if you're darting around with your eyes closed and there are strangers around, you are bound to annoy one of them pretty quickly! Have fun playing "blind tag" for as long as you want!

 It can prevent a lot of arguing if you let the coach or captain address the team/squad.;
, Let them know how you feel; don't go gossiping to other teammates. That only causes more problems.
, Invite them to some of your parties, plan a team night out, etc. As you get to know them better you may be more comfortable talking to them about a problem. Also, if you build up a relationship with trust, it will always lead to better teamwork on the field/court/whatever.
 Always understand that you will get only so much respect by telling people 'But I'm trying my best' or calling them something in return. Also the sight of you making the extra effort can earn you more respect.

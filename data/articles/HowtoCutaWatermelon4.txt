 Carefully cut your watermelon in half. Then place each piece flesh-side down and cut each in half again.
 Make slices 1-2 in (2.5-5.1 cm) wide across the melon, just down to the rind. Do not cut through the rind.
 Start on the side of the watermelon, about 1 in (2.5 cm) below the peak. Make a lengthwise slice into the melon, cutting down so that the tip of the knife runs along the rind. 







, Make a lengthwise slice 1-2 in (2.5-5.1 cm) below your first cut. Donâ€™t cut all the way through the bottom. Turn the melon and repeat this process on the other side.
 Use your knife to slice along the bottom of the rind, using a sweeping motion. You can then pour the watermelon into a bowl or onto a serving platter.

 Don't try to learn more than two to three algorithms in one day unless they are very short because you need to be able to remember them months, maybe years later.;
, If you don't speedsolve every day, start doing it.
 For example, after learning the T perm, try out the Y, F and Jb permutations.
 Not only will this improve your times more quickly, but it will give you a head start if you do decide to learn full OLL. With just 21 Algorithms, it's recommended to learn full PLL at one time, even if it takes you 3 weeks.
 Not only are there far less algorithms, but it will save you more time on your solves.
 Try to get the cube to match the picture. You can even time yourself to try to get faster at scrambling!

, If they are silly, or refer to some inside joke, all the better. For example, you might call the seven corner OLL cases headlights, hammerhead, weird/awkward, Sune, anti-Sune, hammerheadlights and double headlights. Or whatever you like!

, If you have a friend who is also trying to learn the same algorithms, then every day you can each learn one to two algorithms, then teach the other what you learned. This can help sometimes as you can exchange simple mnemonics and remind each other if one person forgets an algorithm. Moreover, everyone learns best through teaching.
 For example, the trigger is very common. It's sometimes referred to as the "sexy" move. There's also , the "sledgehammer." Learn to recognize these triggers, as it can turn a six-move algorithm like into a three move one: .
 Write the algorithms down, including a diagram of the case or how it moves the pieces. Once you can perform an algorithm easily after a day of not seeing it in the notebook, you cross it off.
 For example, the initial author learned the V permutation by seeing how the white stickers move around on the front and right faces. And the Sune should be extremely easy to learn by following the front-right F2L pair.

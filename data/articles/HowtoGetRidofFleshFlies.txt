 Flesh flies get their name because they lay their eggs inside of dead animals and, in rare occasions, even human corpses. Flesh flies also love garbage. Despite their name, these flies are harmless and don't bite.;
, Keep garbage cans at the curb, even if it isn't trash day. Search corners of your house for dead animals (like rats, mice, bird, etc). Keep doors that lead outside closed as often as possible. Sometimes these flies will enter from outside after feeding on something that died outside.
 Use traditional flyswatters, rolled up newspaper, or bug killer spray. Usually these flies will die within a few days of entering your home.

Using bleach and water in equal parts spray works very well also., Keep your vacuum cleaner handy, and when faced with a lot of flies at one time, just suck them in. They get mixed in with all the dust in the bag, and die pretty quickly. After you've decimated the population, replace the bag. This is not recommended with a bagless type vacuum, unless you want to watch the little buggers suffer and die.

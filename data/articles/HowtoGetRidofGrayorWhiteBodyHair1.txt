 If you have noticed a few stray gray/white hairs on your body, your first impulse might be to pluck them out. Instead of plucking--which can cause swelling, redness, and patchy regrowth--use a pair of nail scissors to trim any gray/white hairs down close to the skin., Another quick option is to use an electric trimming device. This is a great option if you need to do more than snip individual hairs and you think a good trim will effectively disguise your gray. Any electric clipper with a plastic guard can be used, although devices made specifically for beards or body hair may give you better control.This is also good to do prior to shaving, if you have a lot of hair to trim down before removing it completely.
Don't use an electric trimmer prior to waxing.
 If you only have a few gray/white hairs to cover, you may be able to spot color them. Try using an eyelash or eyebrow tint product. You could also try using a hair root touch up product. Simply apply either product to the specific gray/white hairs, wait the specified amount of time (see instructions), and rinse.Most of these types of products come premixed. However, for some kits, you may need to mix the color and developer. Simply follow the instructions provided.
Any of these products might tingle. If you feel severe burning, rinse the product off right away.

 If you know something about your boyfriend is going to bother your parents, don't start out the conversation with that. Instead, wait until the middle or end of the conversation to talk about it. For instance, if your boyfriend is older than you, you might want to hold off on that bit of news until near the end of the conversation., If you're going against your parents expectations of you, they are probably going to be upset. You're just going to have to deal with their anger and even tears, until you can get them to see reason., It may take a little while for your parents to get used to the idea. If they get upset while you are talking to them and tell you "no," they might change their minds later when they've cooled down a bit. Either way, you need to respect the fact that you still need to have a relationship with them, meaning you can't just write them off as evil because they told you no.

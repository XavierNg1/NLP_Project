Take 1/3 cup oatmeal and blend in a blender until it's a fine powder.
Pour into your warm bath as you run the water, to help mix it thoroughly.
After your bath the oatmeal powder may be left in tub, especially if you did not blend enough. Don't worry, this isn't difficult to clean (unless you leave it in for days).
Oatmeal baths can be bought in stores too if you would rather nix the extra work of blending it yourself.

If nothing else, spending time in the sun has direct links to lessening depression and anxiety, which is good for everyone., Taking extremely hot baths or showers can scald the skin and dry it out. When possible take warm or cool baths and showers to lessen the effect of the heat on your skin.
 Take a visit to your dermatologist to get a prescription for medication which may help your case. Your doctor may prescribe you a pill, oil, or cream, but each should make a difference in improving your skin.
 Although this is expensive and not beneficial in 100% of cases, getting laser treatment may help severe cases of keratosis pilaris. If you have been struggling for many years with your skin condition, this may be a viable option for you.

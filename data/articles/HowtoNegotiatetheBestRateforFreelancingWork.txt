If the client is not able to give a figure right away, give him time to work it out but let him know that he needs to get back to you when he is ready.
 If the rate is lower, let him know that there is a minimum you must charge for the work to be done. If he persists, then it is time to go over the work and make him understand what it will cost you to do it.

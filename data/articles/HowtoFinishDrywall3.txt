 With a small drywall knife, go over the previous day's compound and knock off any buildup or burrs that escaped the leveling effect of the drywall knife. 15 or 20 minutes of knocking off can make a huge difference in the final product.
 Without a third layer, you'll likely have areas where there's no compound and areas where the compound can be several layers deep (butt joints, for example). The texture on the drywall where there's no compound will look and feel different from drywall that has compound. A third coat of drywall will eliminate this, giving your entire wall the same, even texture.
 Take your roller, dip it into the compound, and lightly start applying it onto the surface of the drywall, working in sections. You don't want the roller to roll as much as glide across the surface, distributing compound.


When rolling the compound onto the drywall, start from the bottom and move upward. This way, your compound won't drip onto the floor.
Be sure to work in manageable sections. You'll be removing most of the compound, so try work in small sections as to keep it from drying out before you have a chance to remove it.
Put the compound on pretty heavy. If you put on compound on too thinly, it tends to dry out. This makes removing it harder, if not impossible.
 The corners are already covered in compound, so there's little need to cake on extra compound where they are. The seams, however, you want to blend, so putting compound over them will help accomplish that.
 With a larger drywall knife, scrape as much drywall compound from the wall as possible. You're not trying to get a plaster finish or a veneer plaster finish; you're simply trying to even out the texture of the drywall with a thin layer of compound.
 Cover and strip the entire wall in this method. Once completed, allow 24 hours for compound to dry, and then sand one final time to prep the drywall for priming.

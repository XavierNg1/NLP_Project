 Roll your pork cubes in this mixture and be sure to give each a good, even coating. You could roll them all one by one or you could just throw them all in there and go for it -- they'll be getting coated in cornstarch here in a second.
 You'll need to do these all one at a time. Roll each cube lightly in the corn starch, coating each piece entirely. Don't try to do it with a spoon or chopsticks -- just get in there with your fingers! The process will go a lot faster.
 For you Celsius fans, that's 176Â°. And an even 1500 seconds, if you were curious.


While your pork is baking, if you'd like to prepare a rice dish, do so now. Quinoa works, too! Both take about the same amount of time. It's 1 part grain to 2 parts water and simmer -- that's all!

, Cut the celery stalks into 1" pieces. If you'd like to add any more vegetables, have at it! The more color in your dish, the better. Try adding red bell pepper, carrots, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and broccoli, too.
 Canola or vegetable oils work, but olive or safflower oil is much healthier. Once heated, throw in your veggies and start sauteing. Cover your pan to let it steam and to use less oil. Stir it occasionally, heating up all sides of your stir-fry, browning evenly.
 Bring the concoction to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low, simmering gently and stirring occasionally. If you'd like to add any other flavors, now's a good time to do so. Maybe a dash of honey or a touch of peanut sauce?

, This should only be 10-15 minutes; the pineapple can become overcooked if you leave it in for much longer.
 Then you can do with it as you please! Combine it with rice or whatever your heart desires. Add peas, carrots, and an egg to your rice to feel like Chinese got delivered right to your doorstep.

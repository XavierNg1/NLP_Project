 Although this won’t take care of padded envelopes that other people send you, it’s possibly for you to purchase recycled padded mailers if you need to send padded envelopes to someone else.Recycled padded mailers are available for sale online, and they are made out of recycled trash in the first place! Thus, they are more environmentally sound. Padded envelopes that are not made of mixed materials (like paper and bubble wrap) will be easier to discard.
Such envelopes may be a little more expensive than regular padded envelopes, but you will gain the peace of mind of knowing that you are not causing extra harm to the environment. There are sites on the Internet that sell recycled paper and green office supplies.Some padded envelopes are also biodegradable, so you don’t need to worry about throwing them into the trash. Check the back of the envelope to see if it's biodegradable.
 Some recycling programs in communities require that the plastic wrap be removed from the paper part of the envelope before it can be recycled.In this case, you would remove any plastic wrap and take it to a plastic film drop off location in your community, if it has one.
Throw away any leftover paper into your normal recycling bin, where you would place other paper items, such as regular envelopes or newspapers.
If the entire envelope is paper and it does not contain any plastic or bubble wrapping, you could put it directly into the recycling bin with other paper items.
 Sometimes, the person or company that sent you the envelope will be better able to reuse it than you are by sending it to another customer.


Used booksellers have been known to include postage that would enable their buyers to send the envelope back. Ask the sender if he or she would like you to return the envelope.

 Make sure that the salon is clean and follows all state safety regulations. Lack of hygiene or access to high-quality skin products may lead to more irritation of your skin, as well as the potential for infection.
 You can conduct your own waxing at home, if you feel confident about your ability to apply and remove the product. There are a wide variety of waxes available, usually at your local pharmacy, that offer a range of methods and tools for self-waxing regimens. Be sure to read all labels before using, so that you’re aware of any potential side effects or irritating ingredients.
 If you don’t have the time or the budget to visit the salon for a hair wax, then find a simple recipe using water, lemon juice, and sugar to make your own wax. A sugar wax is all-natural, containing no unnecessary chemical agents that might cause irritation.
 If you’re waxing at home, first open your pores to allow for easier hair removal. Either press a warm wet cloth to the area to be waxed, or take a warm shower.
 Bacteria and dirt on your skin can lead to redness if not removed before waxing, as the procedure can temporarily open pores wider and allow those irritants access.
 Witch hazel has antiseptic properties, and so it will keep your skin clean after waxing. Additionally, witch hazel is an anti-inflammatory agent, and so it may sooth irritation and redness before it becomes a bigger problem.

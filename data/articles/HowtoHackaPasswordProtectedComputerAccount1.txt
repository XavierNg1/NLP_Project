 If you have administrator access on your computer, you can change any of the accounts passwords without needing any special tools or hacking knowledge.


If you are using Windows XP and need to log in as the Administrator, reboot your computer into Safe Mode and select the Administrator account from the Welcome screen.
Oftentimes, the Administrator account will not have a password attached to it.
If you are the main user of your computer, chances are that you're already the administrator.;
, This can be found in the Control Panel. You can access the Control Panel from the Start menu. If you are using Windows 8, press âŠž Win+X and select it from the menu.


If you are using a Mac, click the Apple menu, select System Preferences, and then click Users & Groups.
 In the Users window, you will see a list of all the accounts on the computer. Select the account you want to access.
 In Windows, this will be a link in the User's options. On a Mac, this will be a button in the Users & Groups window. Enter in the new password, or leave it blank if you want to remove the password completely.
 Once you have changed or deleted the password, you can log in to the account like you would your own. Be aware that this method will make it obvious that you were looking at the account, as the old password won't work anymore.

 Slate and tile can easily slip. This can damage the roof or even cause you to fall. Only experts should climb on top of slate or tile roofs., Rain will significantly increase the likelihood of you slipping and hurting yourself. Even a strong wind can destabilize you or the ladder when you least want it to., If the ground is soft or slanted the ladder could slip out from underneath you. Do not place the ladder on a slanted driveway., You should wear a helmet in case you fall. Wear shoes, like soft-soled boots, that will have good traction on the roof. You can also consider investing in a safety harness that will catch you if you fall.


Safety harnesses can cost about $300, which is more than the cost of having a professional clean your vent, which is about $120. However, if you do a lot of work around the house, a safety harness could be a good long-term investment., This will give you space to safely transfer from the ladder to the roof. If the ladder is not tall enough or requires an extremely steep angle to reach this height, buy a taller ladder., This means that your ladder should extend one foot out from the house for every four feet that it extends up. This ensures that the angle is gentle enough that you will be able to climb safely.


For example, if you know your roof is 21 feet tall and that you want the ladder to extend 3 feet past the roof, then the bottom the ladder should be planted 6 feet from the roof., You should have someone to hold the ladder secure as you climb up. They should also watch for anything that might disturb the ladder. Keep pets and children away from the ladder., To stay secure during the transition, keep both hands on the ladder when you initially step onto the roof. This technique requires that the ladder is positioned so as to extend well past the roof.

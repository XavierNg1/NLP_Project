 If you do not know the name or website of your local Fox News affiliate or need to find an affiliate from another geographic area, you can see a complete listing at the Affiliates page of the Fox News site.


Go directly to the affiliates listing by clicking here: http://www.fox.com/affiliates.php.
Note that the term “affiliates” simply refers to local Fox stations.
 You should see a map of the United States on the affiliates page.


To begin searching through the listings, you first need to select the appropriate geographic region for the affiliate you wish to find.
The map is divided into seven regions: North-East, Mid-East, South-East, Central, Mountain, Pacific, and Other.
 After you select a region, a list of states and affiliates in each state should appear below the map. Scroll through this list until you find the affiliate you need and use the information provided on screen.


Use the contact information provided on the main page. Each listing provides an address, phone number and fax number. You can use these pieces of information to contact that affiliate directly.
Visit the individual website for that affiliate. Each affiliate listing on the Fox News page also has a link to that affiliate's specific website. You can click on that link to go to the website, and once there, you can browse for other contact methods specific to that affiliate.

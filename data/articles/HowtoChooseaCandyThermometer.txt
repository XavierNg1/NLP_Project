 A candy thermometer should be safe to handle and easy to handle. An ideal thermometer will:


Have a metal body
Have a mercury bulb that sits low enough to read the temperature but doesn't touch the cooking container base
Have clear markings and be easy to read
An adjustable clip or hook that allows it to be attached to the side of cooking pan or container.;
, Accurate readings are an important part of making candy. The most accurate type of candy thermometer is the kind which holds the bulb away from the base of the cooking container.


The thermometer should read in the range of 100ºF to 400ºF / 38ºC to 204ºC.
If the thermometer is out by even just a few degrees, it can ruin a sugar syrup or candy mixture.
 You can test the thermometer as follows:


Place it into a saucepan of cold water.
Bring the water to the boil.
Check the reading. It should be displaying 212ºF/100ºC.
If the reading is not showing this, you will need to make adjustments accordingly when using the thermometer (add or subtract the number of degrees by which the thermometer is out). If the thermometer comes home from the store already misreading, return it for another one, explaining that you tested it in this manner.
 Looking down or up at the thermometer can cause you to get the wrong reading.

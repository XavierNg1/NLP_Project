 Perhaps you are storing chemicals in your shed such as weed killer, pesticides, or white spirits.


You might also be storing petrol, diesel, oil or paints: all of these things are toxic.
Some of these items are flammable; others like petrol can give off very noxious fumes, especially in a confined space like a shed.
It’s very important that none of these chemicals are allowed to contaminate the water supply or the ground.
 If you have any of the aforementioned chemicals in your shed, you can take some steps to ensure that they are stored properly. Here’s some basic advice for storage of chemicals in your shed:


Always keep chemicals in the original container.
Store substances such as petrol in containers intended for that purpose. Petrol is corrosive and can wear away at containers not designed for storing petrol, leaking into water and ground and causing a hazard.
Store chemicals out of reach of pets and children, in a cool dry place out of sunlight.
Only buy as much as you need for the year.
Chemicals in powder form should be stored away from, or above, liquids to stop drips and leaks that can cause chemical reactions.
Avoid keeping chemicals past their expiry date.
Dispose of chemicals safely and never down drains or into water.

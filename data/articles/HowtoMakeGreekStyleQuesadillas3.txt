Once it's grated, put it in a strainer, and drain off any extra juice. Place it in a bowl., Add the lemon juice, lemon zest, dill, and Greek yogurt to the bowl. Finely mince the garlic, and add it, too. Add in a sprinkle of salt, and grind in some fresh pepper. Mix the ingredients together thoroughly., You need to give the flavors a chance to meld in the dip. Let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours. For an even better flavor, consider letting it sit overnight in the fridge without the cucumber. Add the cucumber at the last minute the next day. Also, hold the fresh dill back, as the flavor can grow over time., You can swirl in some olive oil at the end for additional flavor. A sprinkling of fresh mint can also be a nice addition.Some people also add a touch of plain white vinegar in place of the lemon juice, if you prefer.

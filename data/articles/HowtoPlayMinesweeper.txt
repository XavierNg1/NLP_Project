 Click Game in the upper-left corner, and select Beginner, Intermediate, Expert, or Custom. If you're new to Minesweeper, start with Beginner.


Custom allows you to determine the number of squares in the grid, as well as the number of mines. You can play around with this later.;
, The number in the lower-right corner denotes the number of mines on the board. The number beside it is the timer.
 Most Minesweeper players click random squares until a group of squares "opens" up. If 4 or 5 squares opened after your click, it's time to evaluate the numbers. If only one square opens after your click, find another random square.


Left clicking uncovers the contents of a given tile. Right clicking or holding alt while clicking marks a tile as a suspected bomb.
 As you uncover tiles, you will see numbers revealed. A number means that there are that number of bombs touching that tile (both sides, top/bottom, and diagonally). If you see a 1 on the board, it means that square is touching exactly 1 mine.
 Eliminate squares that can't possibly contain mines by left clicking. Say you found a 1, and you're pretty sure where the mine for that 1 is. You can click all the other squares around that 1 to open them, because the 1 can only be in contact with a single mine.


Use all of the numbers in a given area to figure out where the mines are.
 When you're reasonably certain you've found a mine, identify it by right-clicking or holding alt and clicking on the square. This will put a flag on the mine, and prevent you from clicking on it.
 As you go around the board, flag potential mines. If you find that you've flagged more mines than the game allows, go back and re-evaluate them.
 After you master Beginner, move on to Intermediate, and then to Expert. As you go on, you'll notice yourself losing less often.

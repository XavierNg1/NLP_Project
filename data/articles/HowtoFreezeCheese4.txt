 You can either purchase pre-sliced cheese packages or slice a block of cheese yourself. Slice a block using a cheese knife, sharp knife or special cheese wire cutters.


If cutting your own cheese, keep the slices an even size.
If you are using pre-sliced cheese, check it before freezing it. If is has any mold on it, it is not suitable for freezing and needs to be discarded.
 These will separate the slices when frozen.
 Stack up to 10 slices at a time, alternating between one slice of cheese and one square of paper. Continue until the stack is formed.
 Label and date.
 Leave it where it is easily accessible, so that household members can grab a slice or two when needed.
 To remove a slice or more, open the package or container and peel away from a paper layer under the first slice. Repeat for each slice needed. Discard the paper layer and use the cheese as usual.

Frozen cheese slices can be added straight to dishes you're preparing, such as lasagna, pie, toppings, etc.

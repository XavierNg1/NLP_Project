 Many people believe dry cleaning is gentler, and thus preferable for an electric blanket. This is not the case. In fact, it’s extremely important to avoid dry cleaning your electric blanket, as the chemicals used in dry cleaning can damage the insulation that surrounds the blanket’s heating elements., In general, you want to do as little cleaning, treating, and otherwise caring for your electric blanket as possible. In particular, never iron an electric blanket, as an iron can easily damage the blanket wires’ insulation., If, during washing or drying, any of the heating wires within the blanket become displaced or otherwise damaged, do not use the electric blanket any further. If you are at all uncertain about the condition of your blanket, the best option is to avoid using it.You can check to ensure the wires are all in place by holding the blanket between you and a bright light source. The wires should all be evenly spaced, and never overlap.
 Most manufacturers recommendations will direct you not to dry your blanket in a commercial dryer, such as those at the laundromat. The reason is heat: commercial dryers can get much hotter, and risk damaging your blanket. However, if you are careful to set the dryer at its lowest heat setting and check frequently to prevent drying the blanket all the way, you can safely use most commercial dryers.

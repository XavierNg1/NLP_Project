 Remove your shoes if they're loud. Don't breathe heavily or scream, and try not to use the stairs as they can be loud.;
,, Under a table is too obvious. If you decide to hide in a closet, find one in a room, get in, and close it (without making a sound, or as little noise as possible). Lock it (if possible) quietly. If you have creaky doors, don't hide in a closet. Instead, hide under a bed, in a cupboard if you're small, in a shower, or even in a dog cage and cover it with a blanket.
 While chatting with an emergency dispatcher, keep your voice quiet so the intruder doesn't hear you.

 Look in pet stores for a cat repellent spray that's safe for use on furniture.


You can use both natural and commercial sprays to deter a cat from going (and then shedding) on surfaces you don’t want it to., Place a comfortable cat bed where your cat enjoys sleeping. This will help keep the shedding contained to a small area and off of your furniture and floors.


Cats generally prefer sleeping in places that are safe, partially hidden, and warm. Try to find a location with those features and set up the cat bed there.Store-bought cat beds may smell of unfamiliar places and materials, which cats find deterring. If your cat seems hesitant to lie in the bed, try covering it with a cloth or shirt that smells like you or your cat., Though perhaps not an ideal solution, you can cover your furniture with a sheet, blanket, or slipcover. You can then wash it to remove accumulated cat fur.


If there’s a particular spot on the furniture your cat frequents, toss a throw, mat, or pillowcase over that spot.



Keep a lint roller in your purse or car so you can de-fur your clothes after leaving the house.
A circle of duct tape with the sticky side out can also work as a makeshift lint roller.

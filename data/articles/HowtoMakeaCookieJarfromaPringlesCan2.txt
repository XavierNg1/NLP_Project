 Wipe it clean from the inside so that there is no residue of chips left behind.
 Place the Pringles can on the wrapping paper, aligned horizontally along one side of the wrapping sheet. Apply glue to that edge and stick it to the can.
 An easier way to do this is to roll the sheet around the can, just like when making edible rolls.
 Make sure you have wrapped the whole can properly and that there is no space left.
 If there is not much to cut away, simply fold the excess sheet inwards.
 These may be ribbons, little flowers, beads, a small note, etc.
 For a gift, you can place a large ribbon flower on the lid.
 The cookies must be placed carefully so that they don't break.
 Use it for yourself or gift someone else. It would be a great gift for birthday or Christmas.

 When youâ€™re pregnant, limit or eliminate the amount of junk food that you eat. This means limiting foods that have high amounts of saturated fat and sugars. Instead, eat healthy snacks full of protein, healthy fats, fiber, and other vitamins and nutrients.For example, try to get rid of candy, cookies, chips, milk chocolate, baked goods, and sugary cereals.
 Choose two or three things you enjoy, and add a serving of each together. This helps satiate your hunger and provide you with healthy calories.For example, pair apples with peanut butter, hummus with carrot sticks, cucumbers, and whole grain crackers, cheese, fruit and nuts, or Greek yogurt with frozen blueberries and walnuts. Each of these combinations has multiple food groups and enough calories to give you and your baby energy.
 When you are pregnant, your snacks should be as nutritious as your meals. Try to have each snack fit in at least two food groups: proteins, dairy, fruit, vegetables, and grains.For example, you should combine protein and healthy fats, or complex carbohydrates and protein, or healthy fats and fiber.

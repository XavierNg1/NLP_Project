 For this glider, you'll need paper, a drinking straw, a ruler, a pencil, paper clips, tape and scissors.


Any kind of paper will work, but thicker paper, like index cards, will work better. If you use index cards, make sure you get the large, 3x5" kind.
 Use your scissors to cut three equal, 1" wide strips out of the paper. If you're using 3x5" index cards, these strips will be 1" wide and 5" long.


You can cut three 1" wide strips by first making three marks along one side of the paper that are one inch apart. If you're using index cards, do this on the shorter side. If you're using printer paper, do this on the longer side.
Then make three marks on the opposite side that are also three inches apart.
Then use a ruler and draw a straight line connecting the marks across the paper, so that you have three 1" thick segments to cut along. Cut along the lines.
 Take one of the strips of paper and fold it into a loop with the two ends overlapping a little. Tape the two overlapping ends together so the loop holds its shape.
 Overlap two of the ends of the other two strips on top of each other by about an inch. Tape them together. Then form the new, twice as long strip into a loop and tape it together.


You should now have two loops of paper, one twice the size of the other.
 Use a paper clip to attach the smaller loop to one end of the straw. Then do the same with the other loop, on the other side of the straw.


The easiest way to do this is to slide the paper clip onto the loop, then slide it into the opening in the straw.
 Hold the glider in-between your thumb, index, and middle finger in the middle of the straw. Throw it like a spear at a slightly upward pointing angle.

 If you notice any of the symptoms of an ear infection, then your Beagle should be checked by a vet.Take your dog to the vet as soon as you notice any problems. The earlier you catch the infection, the better for your dog., When you take your dog to the vet, she will perform a physical examination. She will take a look at your dogâ€™s ears to see if there is pain around the ear, a discharge, or physical changes in the ear. She will also look to see if the dog has a head tilt.The vet will use an otoscope to look down the external ear canal. The otoscope is part magnifier and part light-source, and has a narrow cone which fits down the ear canal and allows the vet to look deep into the ear.
The vet will carefully inspect the ear canal for inflammations, redness, ulcer, discharge, or a foreign body in the ear, such as a grass awn. If a discharge is present and the ear is sore, this is enough to diagnose an ear infection.
 If the dog has ear infections often, or the infection is slow to respond to treatment, the vet may perform further tests. These tests include examining a discharge smear. This allows the vet to identify if simple common bacteria are present or more complex bacteria, check for ear mites, and identify yeasts. This can help target treatment.


The vet may also send a swab away for culture. The lab grows the bugs that are present and then attempts to kill them with different antibiotics in order to tell which is the most effective antibiotic to use to get rid of the infection., If an ear infection is present, the vet will probably clean your dog's ears. Then, she may start with topical ear drops at the office containing medications against yeast, bacteria, or ear mites. You will probably be given ear drops, or an antibiotic or antifungal, for your dog to administer at home.

 Spray the surface with acrylic safe cleaner. Use enough cleaner so that the surface is sufficiently wet. Wipe it clean with a soft cotton cloth, freeing it from dirt and dust. Work with a clean surface so you donâ€™t add additional scratches as you work.Wear rubber gloves while cleaning to protect your hands from the chemicals.

, Dip your sandpaper in the bucket of water as you work. It's also important to wet down the surface, to keep it from getting too hot. Acrylic will melt at high temperatures. As you work, touch the aquarium surface cautiously, to make sure it isn't too warm. If it's hot to touch, take a break. Add water to the surface, allow it to cool, and then continue.
 Work in circles. Remember to keep the paper wet. The surface should now feel smooth. Don't worry if the surface is hazy from the sandpaper creating tiny scratches. You will remove these with the polish.


If the scratch is still visible, progress to 800, 1000, and then 2000 grit. The higher the grit, the finer the sandpaper. , Squeeze NOVUS plastic polish or acrylic polish onto a clean, soft towel. Work in a circular motion, polishing out the scratch until the surface is transparent again and like-new.

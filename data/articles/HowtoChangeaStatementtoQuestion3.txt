 Words like who, what, when, why, where and how are used to find out more information. Adding one of these to a statement doesn't just make it a question; it asks for a specific detail. Use the rules above to turn the statement into a question, then add the question word to the beginning. You must also switch the subject and the verb.


You are going home. → When are you going home?
The sheep jumped over the fence. → How did the sheep jump over the fence?

In this example you are adding a question word and changing the form of the verb jump from simple past to emphatic past (the sheep did jump). You could just as easily use have, which is the simple present perfect, or were (playing), the past progressive.
 Tag questions are statements with a question "tagged" onto the end.The statement stays exactly the same, except for a comma and a question fragment at the end. People often use tag questions when they're looking for confirmation of a fact. Here are some examples:


She eats fish. → She eats fish, right?

James Joyce was Irish. → James Joyce was Irish, wasn't he?


, When spoken aloud, the same sentence can become a question with a different tone of voice, with no other changes. This is never used in writing.


The correct intonation varies depending on what region you're in. It's best to learn this technique from a fluent English speaker from the region you'd like to visit.
 You can add question marks to the ends of sentences in writing, though generally these would be dialog questions.


You are going home. → You are going home?
She's a scientist. → She's a scientist? (insinuates disbelief)

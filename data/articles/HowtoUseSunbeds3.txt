 Expect each sunbed session to continue to effect your skin well after the session ends. Apply moisturizer as needed over the next 12 hours or more to keep your skin from drying out, since moist skin tans more effectively than dry skin. Be doubly certain to do this if you shower, swim, sweat profusely, or are otherwise exposed to liquids after tanning, since these activities may wash off previous applications., Wait 24 hours at the bare minimum before tanning yourself again, whether indoors or outdoors. If you have Type 2 skin, wait at least 48 hours before your next session. To err on the side of caution, wait 72 hours, regardless of your skin type.Again, people with Type 1 skin should refrain from tanning in general. If you decide to do so anyway, always give your overly sensitive skin the maximum amount of rest in between sessions.
 Limit yourself to a maximum of two or three per week if you only tan seasonally. If you plan on tanning all year long, stick to roughly once per week. Limit yourself to 60 sessions in total for the entire year to avoid overexposure.

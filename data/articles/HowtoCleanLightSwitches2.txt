 Fold the cloth in half three times, so that it has eight small sides. You can get the most out of the cloth this way, because there will be eight sides that you can use for up to eight separate light switches., Microfiber naturally disinfects surfaces without the negative side effects of chemicals. Rub down the entire surface of the switch with one of the eight sides of the cloth.If the light switch has visible signs of dirt and grime, you will need to use a different method.
 Do not run water over the cloth, or it will spread the dirt that you have picked up. Instead, use another side of the folded cloth to wipe down the next switch.

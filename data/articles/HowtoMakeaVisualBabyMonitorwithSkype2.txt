 Go find a smart phone that you no longer use, but that is in working condition. It doesn’t have to be the most up-to-date model, but it should have sufficient storage to download the Skype application. Delete other apps to make room, if necessary., Now that the old phone has Skype up and running, go through and make sure that you have active Skype accounts on any phones that you plan to use to monitor your baby, usually your primary cell phone., Use a stand or a shelf to position the phone so that it captures the entirety of your baby’s room or just the crib area, essentially whatever it is you would like to view. Make sure that you get the distance right so that you can see you baby’s movements, but also small details as well.It may help to pull up Skype as you are positioning the room phone. Have your partner or someone else stand in another location and tell you what they are seeing on their connected phone. This will allow you to make small adjustments in positioning.

 To have someone else crack your back, you will need to lay down on a firm surface. The floor or a firm mattress work well. Lay on your stomach and place your arms at your sides. Have the person who is helping you stand just in front of your head.
 The other person should place one hand over the other, and then, they should place their hands in the middle of your shoulder blades. Have them apply just a light amount of pressure to start.
 Make sure that the person can hear your breathing. They should only push down once you have exhaled. It may be a good idea to have the other person instruct you when to breathe out and in, just to make sure.








The person should apply pressure between your shoulder blades as you're exhaling.
You will not hear a pop yet. The other person will have to gradually move down your back to produce a popping noise.
 The other person should keep moving their hands downward. Repeat the process of having them apply pressure as you exhale. The two of you should eventually find a spot that will produce a few good cracks.








Be very careful having someone else crack your back. It can be dangerous as the other person cannot gauge your comfort level. Communicate with the person throughout the process.
If you feel discomfort or pain at any time, ask the person to stop immediately.

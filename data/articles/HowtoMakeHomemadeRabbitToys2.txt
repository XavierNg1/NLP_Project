 Untreated wood like a pinecone makes a great chew toy for rabbits. Rabbits need to chew on wooden objects to help wear their teeth down, and pinecones are a source of wood rabbits would easily find in the wild. You can find pinecones for free in the wild, or for a small price at most pet stores.It might best to put pine cones you gather from the wild in the oven for a bit to get rid of any bugs that might have taken up residence.
 Rabbits love fresh, untreated wood. Apple wood is a particular favorite for most rabbits. If you have access to an apple tree, try snapping off a branch for your bunny and let him chew to his heart's content.
 If you or someone you know have children who have outgrown their toys, some of those toys might be suitable for playful rabbits. A hard plastic teething ring would make an excellent, durable chew toy for a bunny, and would give him hours of entertainment.Make sure the toys do not have any small parts such as eyes or button noses that could be swallowed, and cause a bowel blockage.

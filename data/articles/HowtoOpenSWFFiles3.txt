 Although Adobe has stopped supporting Flash on Android devices, you can download SWF player apps that will allow you to open and play SWF files on your Android phone or tablet. Most of these apps are free and available in the Google Play Store.


You may need to install a File Explorer app in order to find SWF files that you've downloaded to your phone. These file explorer apps are also available on the Google Play Store.
 You can use a variety of conversion service to convert SWF files to either HTML5 or MP4 video format. These formats can be easily read by mobile browsers or video players. You can find these conversion services by searching the web. You may need to convert the file on your computer before transferring it to your Android device. Some popular options include:


Google Swift - This service by Google allows you to convert SWF to HTML 5, which can then be viewed in any modern browser without a plugin.
Freemake Video Converter - This free program can take SWF files and convert them to nearly any video format you choose, such as MP4.

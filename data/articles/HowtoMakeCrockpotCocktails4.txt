 This is how much time you will need for the wine to cook., If you don't have any Merlot at home, or simply don't like it, you can use another fruity red wine, such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Zinfandel. Avoid anything too sweet, however.Use 100% orange juice, without any added sugar. You can also squeeze your own.
 Wash and scrub the orange well. Poke the cloves, pointy-end first, into the peel. If the peel is too thick, you can poke holes into it using a toothpick or skewer first.

Use an organic orange if you can. You will be soaking it in the wine for several hours, after all., You can use fresh or frozen cranberries for this. Be sure to rinse them well, and to pick out any stems., You are ready to serve the wine when the cranberries turn tender. You can cook it for another 1 to 2 hours, but keep the heat on "low" and don't let the wine come to a boil., Use a slotted spoon to scoop out the orange and cinnamon sticks. Next, place a strainer over a large bowl or pot, then pour the wine through it. Don't take the strainer off just yet., Be very careful. Some of the cranberries may burst and spurt hot liquid. Once you have smooshed all of the cranberries, take the strainer off of the bowl/pot and discard the skins., If it is not sweet enough, you can stir in some more sugar., Pour hot, boiling water into your serving mugs and wait 1 to 2 minutes. Pour the water out, then dry the mugs off with a clean towel. The hot mugs will help keep the mulled wine warm longer., Cinnamon sticks or fresh orange slices make great, simple garnishes. If you want to get fancy, however, push 3 to 4 fresh cranberries onto a cocktail stick, and use that instead.

 When you want to clean non-porous surfaces such as toilets and showers, sinks, and vinyl or tile floors, use a bleach to water ratio of 1:32. Add a half cup (118.3 ml) of bleach to a gallon (3.8 L) of water. Mix this in a sturdy plastic bucket., Using a mop for floors or a clean rag for other surfaces, carefully dip into the solution and wring the mop or rag out. Wipe the surface in sweeping motions. Go in a back and forth pattern to make sure you cover the whole area.

Make sure not to clean with bleach on surfaces like wood, leather, canvas, or carpet. Bleach will stain and fade this type of porous surface.
 If you let the bleach solution dry on the surface, it can leave residue. Always use a bucket of clean water, and a clean mop or rag if possible, to completely rinse the surface. A bleach odor may remain in the air after you rinse the surface, which is okay.

 Although the dog is small, it will appreciate having its own sleeping space rather than being expected to curl up anywhere. Some options for a good sleeping space include:


A small pillow or cushion in a suitable corner or area of the room intended for sleeping.
A small dog bed. This can be placed anywhere, including inside a kennel. Add some blankets or cushioning.
Make the space comfortable.;
, This will help to reduce the flea population and keeps everything nice for your chihuahua.
 Chihuahuas eat hard and soft dog food.
 That way you won't be tempted to overfeed your chihuahua.
, It doesn't matter how cute they are, do not feed your chihuahua human food unless you are absolutely certain is both safe and appropriate for the dog.
 Use safe, soft toys. Chihuahuas enjoy playing fetch and tug-of-war.
 Twice a day is good. Try not to carry the dog everywhere––he needs exercise as much as you do.
 Give your dog as much love as possible.

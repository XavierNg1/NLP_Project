 Wax ear plugs come packaged in tiny balls surrounded by cotton. Use your fingers to peel the cotton away before using. Use one hand to roll the ball between your thumb and index finger. With your other hand, pull away the cotton as you roll the ball. Continue spinning the ball of wax and pulling away the cotton until it is completely removed.
 In order to make the ball of wax moldable, take a moment to soften it. You can do this easily by enclosing the ball in your fist for about 40 seconds. You should start to feel the ball become soft and sticky.
 Hold the ball in between your thumb and forefinger. With your other hand, pinch the top of the ball of wax. Continue pinching while you rotate the ball with your other hand. The wax should start to form a rounded cone shape.
 It is important to keep your hair out of the way given how sticky these plugs tend to be. If you have very long hair, you may want to tie your hair back before you attempt to insert the ear plug.
 Insert the ear plug until it seals off your canal. Most of the plug should be in your ear canal, with a small end sticking out. Rub on the end of the plug, spreading it over your ear canal to form a seal. This should successfully muffle outside sound.

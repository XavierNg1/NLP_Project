 After all, how can one devote so much time into dressing up, reading old literature and collecting obscure music without being somewhat Geeky? You will hence find typical Geek traits in all Goth's, but some will be more Geek-y than others.
 So while they may not look as spectacularly Gothic as other Goth Types, their knowledge of the symbolism and artistic influences behind Goth is very often superior. They are more inclined than most to indulge in role play, read science-fiction, fantasy and horror novels, and watch cult TV shows and films with Gothic appeal. Geek Goth's are also more likely to be into computer games and anime than other Goths. You are far more likely to find them in Forbidden Planet than in a goth club., Fittingly, they frequently have diverse and eclectic taste in music, although they may be more attracted to bands who regularly sing about Lord of the Rings, Cthulhu or other subjects with a high Geek interest.

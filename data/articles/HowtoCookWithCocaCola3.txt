 Mix cola along with your choice of barbecue sauce, in 50:50 ratio. This will enhance the taste of the original sauce. If you'd rather make barbecue sauce from scratch using cola, try this recipe:Gently cook 1 chopped onion and 2 chopped cloves of garlic in 2 tablespoons of butter until soft.
Add 2 cups of catsup, 6 ounces of cola, 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon of mustard, and 2 tablespoons of vinegar.
Simmer for one hour or until the mixture has thickened.
 Add the cola to the beef marinade along with whatever else you're planning to use as marinade (such as salt, pepper, garlic, and herbs). Just be careful when cooking, as the cola contains sugar and will cause the outside of the marinated meat to darken and crisp faster than the inside.See also How to make Coca Cola marinade for a specific recipe.

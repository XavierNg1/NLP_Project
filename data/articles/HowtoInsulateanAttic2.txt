 Be sure you're wearing your safety equipment, as the itchy fibers of the batting can cause respiratory problems and eye irritation without a barrier in place. Only unroll your batting once you're in the attic, to avoid letting fibers contaminate the rest of your house.
 Unroll the batting blanket into the space between two joists. If the blanket isn't wide enough to match the width of the space between joists, unroll it from joist to joist instead, and lay more short lengths next to each other until the full length between the two joists is packed.


Press and tuck the edges of each part of the blanket, to make sure they fit snugly and that there are no gaps between them.
Cut a hole in the insulation wherever there is electrical wiring. Pull the wiring up through the hole and rest it on top of the insulation, so that the heat it generates will dissipate upward rather than being trapped under the insulation.
 If you're fairly sure that one layer of insulation isn't enough to reach an R-38 rating, you can add another layer. Lay this layer at right angles to the first layer, to reduce leaks and gaps.


Be sure to cut holes for electrical wiring and pull it through the second layer, as well.
Remember, the rule of thumb is that if your insulation is at about the same level as the tops of your joists, the insulation should be adequate. However, if you want to be sure, you can compare the R-ratings per level of insulation to the R-rating you're trying to achieve, and make a more educated guess based on that.

 To make a harm-free, mole repelling spray, combine 1/4 cup (2 oz) of castor oil, 1 tbsp. (0.5 oz) of cayenne pepper, and 2 tbsp. of liquid dish detergent in a large bowl or container. Add 1 tbsp. (0.5 oz) of water and stir, then pour the mixture in a container to store. When needed, mix 2 tbsp. (1 oz) of the mixture to a gallon of water and fill a spray bottle. Spray mounds, raised ridges, and the surrounding area of your yard.Castor oil, a powerful mole repellent, can also be effective when applied to the soil on its own.
 Another harm-free mole deterrent option might be an ultrasonic device emitting an underground sonic pulse to repel moles and other underground rodents (e.g. gophers). The penetrating vibrations will not affect you or your house pets, but will effectively deter pests from tunneling nearby. The MoleChaser, for instance, is a small, waterproof, battery-operated spike that can be inserted into the ground to repel underground rodents, and is available online for approximately $25.
 Find an active mole tunnel in your garden and dig to widen one of its entrance holes enough to fit a live trap in. Monitor the trap closely to make sure that the mole does not stay trapped inside too long. Drive the mole, still in the trap, at least 5 miles away from your home before releasing it to relocate it.

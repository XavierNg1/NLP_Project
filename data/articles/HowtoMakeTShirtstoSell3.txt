 You can use a sketch you have drawn previously as a guideline or use a stencil or pattern to help you with proper placement of the rhinestones.
 Grab your glue gun or special glue pen.
 Continue gluing the rhinestones onto the t-shirt until you complete the pattern.
 Experiment with different patterns and different colored rhinestones to get an idea of what design works best with the rhinestones you purchased.

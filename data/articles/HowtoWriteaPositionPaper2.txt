 This will allow you to make an articulate, informed case to support your position.


Visit libraries and conduct research online. Check books, journals, newspapers, blogs and websites for recent news on the topic and relevant studies that support and oppose different positions.
Take advantage of primary sources as well as scholarly articles, news reports and statistics. An example of a primary source is a constitutional lawyer if you are writing about the death penalty or a professional football player if you are writing about head injuries in athletes.
 Most people write position papers based on their own views, but you may be a student assigned to a specific position, or you may want to explore all sides of the issue in your paper.
 They might be expecting a particular position in your paper. If your audience is doctors, for example, they might be surprised to read a colleague's position paper on preventative medicine being unnecessary.


Remember that you do not need to change your own position to suit your audience. You should choose your own position or viewpoint, just keep in mind the way your audience things or reasons as you being to write the paper.

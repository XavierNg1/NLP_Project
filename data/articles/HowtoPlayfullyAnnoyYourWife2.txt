 Then say something like “Oh, I didn’t see you there.”#Move her things out of reach. If you are taller than your wife, you can have fun placing her things up on high shelves or in cabinet’s that she can’t reach. She’ll be annoyed if she has to ask you to get them down for her, especially if you do it over and over again. Grab the thing she needs and hand it to her, saying something like “Well, I wonder how that got up there? Glad I was around to help you.”, There’s not real harm in innocently flirting with someone, and it might just get on your wife’s nerves in a playful way. For instance, you could offer a waitress a compliment, or joke around with a stranger—anything to get your wife’s attention. You may not want to try this technique, however, if your wife is very jealous or if you have had commitment issues., Especially when you are out in public, you can annoy your wife if you move or talk very expressively. Try speaking dramatically, placing your hands on your cheeks to indicate “shock,” placing a hand on your forehead to indicate that you are overcome with emotion, etc., Take a big box and put a tag with your wife’s name on it. You could even put a brick in it to make it seem heavy. She’ll think it’s a large, heavy gift. Inside the box, place TONS of crinkled paper and just a tiny box with a piece of jewelry in it. She'll be so surprised, and a little annoyed at being fooled.
 A little competition can actually be a great way of showing your wife you are thinking about her. The sillier the game, the more likely she is to be both annoyed and happy. You can challenge your wife to a variety of games, or just start one up and see if she participates:A snowball fight
Thumb wrestling
A dance-off
A water gun battle
A tickling match

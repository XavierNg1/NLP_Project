 One of the first signs of adrenal gland disease is patches of hair that look different than the rest of the coat. These patches will contain hair that is short and oddly textured, like wool., When a dog has adrenal gland disease, the Pomeranian sheds her fur right down to the skin and the fur doesn't regrow. The fur loss is in a symmetrical pattern so the hair loss on the left of the body mirrors that on the right.Hair loss usually occurs on the trunk and back thighs, and not on the head or front legs., When the dog loses her hair, the exposed skin often becomes hyperpigmented. This means that the skin changes from a regular pink or beige color into a dark brown or black color. Additionally, the skin is often dry and scaly., Another way you know your Pomeranian has this condition is that hair does not regrow after it has been clipped or shaved., Pomeranians of any age or sex can be affected. This means that through your dogâ€™s entire life, you need to watch for signs of this condition.Although a dog can get this condition any time, the dog is healthy otherwise even if she does start to show the symptoms.

 This is the setting that Microsoft recommends.
In Windows XP, you can also choose how often and at what time you want Windows to install the updates. Use the drop-down menus to determine whether you want them to install every day or a particular day of the week, and what time of day. If your computer is inactive at that time, updates will be installed at the next opportunity.






In Windows Vista and 7,you can choose when and how often your computer does so. Select "Every day" or a particular day of the week, and then the time of day. If your computer is inactive at that time, updates will be installed at the next opportunity.






If you choose "Download updates but let me choose whether to install them," Windows will automatically download the update files once a day. Then, you will choose whether to install them onto your computer.






If you choose "Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them," Windows will alert you if updates are available and ask you whether to download and then install them.






If you choose "Never check for updates," Windows will not automatically check for updates. Microsoft always recommends against this option.

 Place the flour in a shallow bowl. Dredge each piece of chicken on both sides so that they get entirely coated. Place the chicken pieces on a plate and prepare to fry them.
 Pour oil into a cast iron skillet, dutch oven, or another heavy frying pan. Place the pan over medium high heat to heat the oil. Add a little more oil if necessary; it should rise up the sides of the pan by about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm), but not enough to submerge the pieces of chicken.
 When the oil is hot, lay a few pieces of chicken into the pan. Let them fry on the first side for about 4 minutes, then use tongs to flip them over and fry them on the other side for another 4 minutes. The chicken should be cooked through and golden brown when you remove it from the pan to drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Continue frying the remaining pieces of chicken in this manner.
 Cover it with aluminum foil to keep it warm while you make the mushroom sauce.

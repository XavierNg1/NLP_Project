 Place three organic raspberries in a cocktail shaker with the juice from half of a fresh lemon. Use a muddler to smash the fruit and liquid together until the berries are completely crushed.You can substitute a thick wooden spoon or wooden meat tenderizer if you don’t have a muddler.
 After you’ve muddled the berries, pour 1 ½ ounces (45 ml) of raspberry infused vodka and ½ ounce (15 ml) of sweet vermouth into the cocktail shaker. Next, add enough ice to fill the shaker, and shake the mixture together so all of the ingredients are fully combined.It helps to store your vodka in the freezer so it will be chilled when you add it to the cocktail shaker.
 Once the martini is completely mixed, use a cocktail strainer to strain it into a martini glass. Place 3 or so fresh raspberries on a cocktail skewer, and float it in the martini as a garnish.Chill your martini glass in the freezer for a half hour or so to help keep the cocktail cold.

 If your child has a lingering cold (that lasts over a week), call the pediatrician's office. Ask the doctor what medications or other treatments you can give your toddler to make them more comfortable. If your child has the flu, the doctor may want to see them in order to make a diagnosis and prescribe any medications.


Don't be afraid to call the doctor's office and describe symptoms that your toddler has. If you're still unsure if your toddler has the flu or a cold, it's best to get a medical diagnosis.
 If your toddler has a cold, you can give them over-the-counter pain relief (like ibuprofen or acetaminophen) to relieve some cold symptoms (like headache, general aches and pains, and fever). Follow the dosing instructions based on your child's weight and age. Ensure that you only give your child children's pain relief medication.


Avoid giving your toddler aspirin. Aspirin in children has been linked to Reye's Syndrome, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition., Regardless of if your toddler has the flu or a cold, they need to be getting fluids to replace the fluids they're losing by coughing, sneezing, or vomiting. Offer your child plenty of water, broth, and juice to prevent the risk of dehydration. If your child is refusing all fluids, contact the doctor since dehydration can develop quickly.


You can also try giving your toddler fruit-juice popsicles to suck on.
 If your toddler is congested or has a cough, you may want to set up a cool-mist humidifier in their room. Run the humidifier at night when they're trying to sleep so it's easier for them to breathe and fall asleep. Keep your toddler cozy, calm, and entertained while they're sick. This can distract them from focusing on their own discomfort.


Try curling up with your toddler under the blankets. Spend time snuggling and reading stories.

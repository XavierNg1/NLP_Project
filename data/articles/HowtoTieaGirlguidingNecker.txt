 Some people choose to iron their neckers before rolling. The long end of the necker should be facing you.;
, Ask them to hold down the point furthest away from you. Alternatively, use something such as a paperweight or heavy book.
 Roll the necker from the middle and stop 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) from the end.
 Take hold of the necker in the middle and shake it about three times, as this will neaten out the rolling.
 Ensure the necker is still rolled at this point. This will create two strands.
 To do this, take the left hand strand and fold it back on itself, towards you.
 The right hand strand should then be crossed over the folded back left strand.
 Do not bring the strand all the way around, just underneath.
 This will unfold the left hand strand and create the square formation for the knot.
 In order to secure the knot, simply pass the right hand strand through the loop created by the left hand strand and pull.

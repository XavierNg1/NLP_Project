 The first forward tumbling skill that a gymnast learns is a forward roll. To do a forward roll, you need to put your hands on the floor right in front of your toes, and tuck your head in keeping your chin on your chest and roll forward. You should put your hands down at the start and not to stand up and try to keep your knee's and feet together.;
,, The most common mistakes are putting your hands too far away from your feet to start, not tucking your head to keep your back round, using your hands to stand up and crossing feet or opening knee's to stand up.
 Also, try under your chin to keep it on your chest.
 For example, try a continuous forward roll, forward rolls that start and finish in different positions and so on.
 To do this, kick up to a handstand, then tip over further putting your chin on your chest and rounding your back so you roll out.


When you first learn this skill, you should get a coach to help you or do it down an incline or onto a soft mat.
, This is when you kick up to a handstand, land in a bridge and then stand up.
 Do lots of bridges every day to increase your shoulder flexibility.
 First try this going up and down a wall with your hands, over a cylinder, with your coach spotting or up onto a raised surface

, Arch your back and let you feet fall into a bridge relatively close to your hands. Then rock your hips forward over your feet to stand up. Roll up from your hips, your head and arms should come up last.
 This is like a front limber but you go over one foot at a time. Make sure you land on a straight leg as you do this skill.

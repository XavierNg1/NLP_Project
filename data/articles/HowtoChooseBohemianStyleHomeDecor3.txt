 bohemian style includes interesting furniture. You can get this look by painting your own furniture. Turn a boring table or dresser into a bohemian piece by painting it a bright color and adding accents to it.For example, you may color the base of the dressed one color and paint each drawer a different accent color. Take a table and paint a geometric pattern on it. Take a chair, paint it, and add accents on the slats and the seat.
 Bohemian-inspired rooms are very cluttered. They have many different pieces of furniture, including tables, chairs, and chests. Everything is next to one another, cramped, and overflowing with knick knacks, blankets, pillows, and rugs.Donâ€™t be afraid to put more furniture, accessories, and accents in the room.
 Rugs are an essential part of bohemian decor. You can add one rug in a bright design, or you can cover your entire floor in mix matched patterned rugs. Long flowing curtains in bold designs or made of textures like satin, silk, or lace finish off the bohemian look.You may combine a window treatment and bed canopy by using part of the canopy around the windows.
Beading also makes a very bohemian window treatment.

 Close your eyes, and picture a life full of wonders.;
,, Look at it. Embrace it because it feels so good to see how you want to live your life.
 Understand how the mirror didn't break when you looked at it. Do you know why? It's because you're beautiful. It's because all the lies that were fed to you years, months, days at a time, you took that in as your state of mind and you followed what they all said about you. You never once came to realize that YOU, by yourself, are the most amazing being alone. Why be someone your not, when you can be better than anyone else just by being who you are meant to be. When you write your story, don't let someone else hold the pen. You're the author, and you should be free to write down what it is you feel.

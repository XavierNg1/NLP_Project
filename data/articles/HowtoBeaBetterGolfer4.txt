 Watching golf is a great way to get better. As you are watching, evaluate what the professional golfers are doing and take notes. Watch how professional players assess each shot before they take it and note the decisions that were made. Look at how each player swings the driver, the wedges, and the putter.Imagine yourself taking the same shot the players on television are taking. Where would you aim for the shot? Compare the choice you made to what the professional player has done.
Try to imitate some of the shots you see at your next practice session.
Good golf players typically have a pre-shot routine (i.e. what they do before they take every single shot). Use the examples of pre-shot routines to help you develop your own routine.Begin to incorporate your routine into your practice sessions.
A pre-shot routine may consist of checking the lie of the ball, checking the distance to your target, checking the direction of the wind, selecting a shot, choosing a club, visualizing the shot, and taking a few practice swings., Visualizing your shots allows you to practice golf from any location. Devote five minutes a day to visualization practice. Focus on the things that you have done well on the golf course. Did you sink a putt? Did you hit a nice long drive?It is important that you make visualization a regular activity. The more consistently you do it, the more beneficial it will be.
Avoid replaying your mistakes when you visualize.
 Increasing the strength of your muscles and bones without bulking up too much will help your golf game. Your strength training program should be focused on lifting heavier weights with fewer repetitions. Choose a weight that you can lift about six or seven times before your body becomes really tired.Try exercises that mimic natural movements and engage multiple muscle groups such as squats and dead lifts.
Aim for four sets, of one to six repetitions. Rest three minutes between each set.

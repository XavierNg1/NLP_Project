 These containers can be found at most craft stores, but can also be purchased online. After you remove the lid from your push pop container, slide the bottom all the way down so the body of the container is hollow.


After you have removed the lid, this can be thrown away. This kind of confetti popper can easily be reused, but it won't need a top., You can use traditional confetti, but this popper works well with tinsel, too. You may want to use your scissors to trim tinsel into smaller pieces. This way, it'll float in the air more easily.


Add your confetti or tinsel (or both) to the hollow part of the push pop container until it is completely full., Cut a small square of tissue paper that is large enough to cover the opening of the push pop container. Use tape to fasten the tissue paper firmly over the open end., This can be done easily by wrapping the outside of the popper with decorative paper and taping or gluing this in place. However, you could also paint the outside of the popper, draw designs on it, or personalize it however you wish., When you're ready to launch your confetti mixture into the air, push the stick end of the push pop container upward in a quick, firm motion. This should cause the tissue paper to pop, and the confetti to explode outwards.,

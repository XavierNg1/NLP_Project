 Include many candies, like bones, brooms, and hats. Also have entrees, like mummies (hotdogs wrapped with dough) or orange pumpkins (peeled oranges with celery slices pushed into the top) plus desserts, like brain jello (you'll need a brain jello mold and raspberries) and donut monsters (donuts with vampire teeth in the middle, and chocolate chip eyes).


For drinks, fill a surgical glove with water, close it with a twist tie, and freeze it. Then, fill the bowl with punch, add the ice hand, and voila! You'll have a gross-out punch!

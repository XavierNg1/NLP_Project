 Is the noise level of the storm too loud that you can't concentrate? Try moving to a different part of the classroom or slightly cover your ears with your hands. Can you not help but glance outside the window to look at the overwhelming sight? Ask your teacher if you may shut the window blinds because the storm is bothering you.;
, Work on the assignment that they handed out, or take notes if they're giving a lecture. Whatever the case may be, the goal is to get yourself preoccupied in your schoolwork. Volunteer for anything else if one is needed from the class.
 Calm yourself down, and try to relax a little bit. Understand that the storm will probably be over in less than an hour. Realize that if you were in extreme danger, more precautions would be taken.
 Think about what you are going to eat for lunch, do when you get home, etc. Plan some activities to do once the weekend comes. Pass a note to a friend if one sits close to you. Start getting excited for a sport or club if you have one after school.
 Pick up any book you can get your hands on. Try to get deep into the reading so you can block out the other noises. Imagine yourself as the main character, decide what you would do if you were in their shoes, etc. Predict what you think will happen in the next chapter or at the end of the book.

 The cables which are attached to the DVD drive are very delicate so carefully remove this component first. Lift it up just enough to get to the cables and then gently pull out both of them.


The DVD drive can be flashed, through a complex modding process, if certain malfunctions occur or firm or software modding is desired. However, if Microsoft discovers this type of modding, it will earn you a lifetime ban from Xbox Live.
 First, lift the white section of plastic. The fan below can be popped out, but there are also cables attached, so carefully remove those before pulling the fan out all of the way.
 The ring controls are easily accessed for modding or repair once the case is open like this.
 The motherboard will also now be easily visible and accessible. You can carefully pull it up by the silver box at the center or fix it in place.


Access to the motherboard can allow you to fix the heatsink (the usual cause of the Red Ring Of Death) by re-soldering or installing new screws. It will also allow you access for software or firmware mods, like reset glitch hacks. Just remember that these are very complex processes, even for those who are very skilled, and can get you banned by Microsoft.
 Though it is not located in the main case, you can also open the hard disk drive in order to install a drive with more storage space. This is done by unscrewing all of the pieces, unplugging the HDD and sliding it out of the bay. At this point it is easily replaced with another hard drive, as the cables used are standard.

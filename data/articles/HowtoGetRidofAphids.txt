1/2 cup of vegetable oil
6-8 drops of dish soap (Do not use too much soap, as it can burn the leaves.)
A pinch of cayenne pepper.

 Ants can kill insects that feed on aphids, so using an ant killer around your plants may help. Ants also herd (farm) aphids. Meaning that the ants will keep the aphids alive and protect them as an available food source.

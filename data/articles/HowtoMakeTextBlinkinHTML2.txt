 In between the <head> and </head> tags of your HTML document, insert the following JavaScript code:function blinktext() {
  var f = document.getElementById('announcement');
  setInterval(function() {
    f.style.visibility = (f.style.visibility == 'hidden' ? '' : 'hidden');
  }, 1000);
}

, The code above defined a function and named it "blinktext." In order to use this function in your HTML, change the <body> tag to <body onload="blinktext();">.
 This script only affects elements with the id "announcement." Place your blinking text inside any element and give it that id. For example, type <p id="announcement">Blinking text here.</p> or <div id="announcement">Blinking text here.</div>.


You can rename this anything you like. Just make sure to use the same word in the script and the element id.
 The number "1000" in the script sets the delay between blinks. This is in microseconds, so a value of 1000 makes the text blink once per second.Change this to a lower number to speed up the blinking, or a higher number to slow it down.


The actual delay probably won't match this value perfectly. It tends to be slightly shorter, but can take longer if your browser is busy with other requests.

 If you live in a mild climate (growing zone 7 or warmer), you can plant leeks in the fall for a spring harvest, then plant again in the late spring for a fall harvest. Leeks planted later in the year will overwinter and grow in the spring. If you live in a climate with harsh winters, leeks should be planted in very early spring, as soon as the ground is workable.


Different leek varieties are meant for different planting times. Ask an expert at your local nursery to inform you what varieties work best in your climate.;
, Fill seed trays with a seed starting mix (not potting soil) and sow the seeds about 6 weeks before the last frost of the winter. Leek seeds germinate best at a temperature around 77 °F (25 °C), so keep them in a warm, sunny room.If you're starting seeds in the fall, you can keep them outdoors in a sunny spot. Keep the starting mixture moist.


If you wish, you can direct sow the seeds instead of starting them in trays. Prepare a planting bed with plenty of compost. Plant the seeds 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) deep and several inches apart.
The seedlings are ready to transplant when they grow to be at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) long.
 Prepare a permanent bed for the seedlings. Choose a spot in the sun that has well-draining soil. Work compost into the soil to a depth of at least 8 inches (20.3 cm). Dig a trench 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep.Leeks must be planted deep in the soil so that the base of the stem stays out of the sun and becomes "blanched." The blanched part is the white, tender, edible part of the leek.

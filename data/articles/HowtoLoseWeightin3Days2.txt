 Sodium helps to store water in the body, and limiting your intake of salt and other foods high in sodium can help you get rid of extra girth-widening water weight.Limit your daily sodium intake to 1-1.5 grams (.04-.05 oz) a day. (Less than 2.3 grams, or .09 oz, is the medically recommended amount for those under 50).Avoid canned and prepackaged foods, including sauces and dressings. These types of preserved foods often rely on salt as a preservative and are thus packed full of sodium.
Drop deli meats and cold cuts. These are also packed with sodium.Skimp on the salt when cooking.
Cut down on cheese. Cheese is high in salt.
 It's important to stay hydrated.


Get lots of water. It might seem counter-intuitive, but drinking a lot of water is quite important when you're trying to lose water weight. Drinking about a gallon (3.8 liters) of water throughout the day will help to normalize your hydration levels and keep you fluids in balance.Add some lemon to your water. Lemon can act as a digestive aid and diuretic, which can help with both water retention and bloat.
Go for that second cup of coffee or tea. These drinks can act as diuretics, which means they stimulate your body to release more water.
 Besides sodium, the levels of cortisol in the body also affect water retention.Make sure your cortisol levels are in check by getting at least 7-9 hours of sleep a night.
Try scaling back on your exercise activities for 3 days. Exercise can actually elevate cortisol.Relax and de-stress with calming tea, soothing music, meditation, and breathing exercises. These can all help chill you out and bring down your cortisol levels.

 Though it may sound obvious or even condescending, it's a common misstep for people to get too confident and rushed while they're painting. This is especially true when it comes to painting large spaces such as ceilings and walls. Needless to say, the amount of time you'll be potentially saving is not work risking damaging your clothing over. Go slow with your work, and make sure you aren't tracking any excess paint on your brush or roller before moving onto applying it.
 An apron is a commonplace way of protecting your clothing. Aprons can take a beating, and most would agree it doesn't really matter how they look or how much paint gets on them. If you have a kitchen apron you don't mind about keeping the appearances of, you should wear it while you're painting.
 While this advice is arguably limited solely to home painting situations and wouldn't go over well in any professional context, the easiest way to save your clothes from paint is to disrobe down to your undergarments. That way, if you get paint on yourself, you can easily just hop in the shower and get it off.
 Even if you exercise all of the precautions, there's always a chance that mistakes will occur. If a stain does happen, it really helps to have all of the materials (such as rubbing alcohol or an oil solvent) in the same room to minimize having to run around to fetch it when time is of the essence.

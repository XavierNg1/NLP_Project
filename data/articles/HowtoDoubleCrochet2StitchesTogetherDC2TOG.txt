 Like any double crochet, you need to start with a yarn over. You're probably a pro at yarning over by now, but in case you're not:


With your current loop on the hook, pull the tail of the yarn up, behind the hook. Then pull it down over the front side of the hook, so that it lays over the shaft/throat, and tucks just under the actual hooked region. When you later pull the hook through a stitch, your yarn will come with it.
This is called yarning over, and it's done from back to front as part of many crochet stitches. Once you get into your flow, you'll be able to yarn over with just a quick twitch of your hand and twist of your hook.;
, This should be the first stitch of the two you're combining.
, You should have three loops on the hook.
, This should feel familiar from regular double crocheting. You'll now have two loops on your hook.
, This is where things get different form a regular double crochet.
, You'll now have four loops on your hook.
, You'll have three loops on your hook.
, Your DC2TOG is done! Once you get into the flow of it, you'll see how you're combining two double crochets into one stitch with ease.

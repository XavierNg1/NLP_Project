 Use a large saucepan. Pour in 2 quarts (2 l) of water. Add 1 cup (185 g) of long grain rice. Break one cinnamon stick into pieces and add that, too. Let them soak for three hours., After the rice mixture has steeped for three hours, place the saucepan on your oven’s burner if you haven’t already done so. Set the heat to medium-high. Once the water starts to boil, lower the heat. Let it simmer for half an hour., First, let the rice and water cool back down once it has simmered. Then either transfer the contents to a blender or use an immersion blender in the saucepan. Puree the rice until it combines with the water and creates a smooth texture.
 Place a fine sieve over a large container. Either pour or ladle the mixture into the sieve to strain the liquid into the container. Discard the residue left in the sieve., Stir in ½ cup (100 g) of white sugar to sweeten (or less, as desired). For extra flavor, add a teaspoon of vanilla. Refrigerate the container to cool the liquid. Serve over ice when ready.

 Your dentist may recommend dental treatments like a dental expander on your front teeth to fill in the gap between your teeth. This can help make your lisp less pronounced., This device will prevent you from pushing your tongue between your teeth, thereby reducing your lisp. The device rests on the back third of your tongue to prevent you from pushing it forward too far. The tongue appliance must be fitted to your mouth by an orthodontist.You may need to then get the appliance refitted as you get older so it still fits your mouth correctly. Your orthodontist may suggest that you do speech therapy as well to improve your lisp.
 If your teeth are crooked, this can cause speech issues like a lisp. Your dentist may suggest oral surgery to straighten or realign your teeth. This can then improve your lisp. Talk to your dentist for more details on the procedure.

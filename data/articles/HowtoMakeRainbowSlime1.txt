, The mixture will start to get gooey and resemble slime.
 Using your hands or a wooden spoon, scoop about half of a cup of slime into each bowl.
 Add a couple drops of liquid watercolor paint or food coloring into each bowl, making a rainbow of colors. If you want dark rainbow slime, add 10-15 drops, but if you would prefer a lighter-colored rainbow slime, add 6-10 drops.
 Stir until the color is vibrant and bright, resembling a rainbow.
 Have fun playing with the rainbow slime and looking at its bright colors. You may enjoy slightly combining multiple slime colors to make the slime really resemble a rainbow (but be careful not to fully mix them together, or the slime will turn gray).

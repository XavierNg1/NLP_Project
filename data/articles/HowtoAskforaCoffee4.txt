 It is proper etiquette for a person to offer you something once you're settled in (jacket off, sitting down). If they have forgotten their manners, proceed to the next step.



Note that it's better to ask this if you can drink whatever they have, but not if you're picky about your coffee. For example, if they don't have decaf coffee with hazelnut creamer and brown sugar, and that's the only way you like it, it might be considered rude for you to have this expectation or make this request.

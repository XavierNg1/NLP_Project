 While your cat is recovering from an injury and wearing a splint or bandage, it should be kept indoors at all times. The odds of your cat's wound wrapping getting wet or loosening are greater outdoors, which could lead to infection or further injury. If you do choose to let your cat outdoors, be sure that its bandage or splint is protected with a waterproof covering (available in many pet stores, or online.), To prevent your cat's bandage from getting loosened, ripped, or chewed, purchase protective bandage-covering clothing for them to wear. Veterinary jackets or boots can keep your cat's bandage or splint dry and clean while they heal. Check with your veterinarian to make sure that such a product would be appropriate for your cat's specific wound, and look online for models that are waterproof, well-made, and properly sized for your pet., While your cat is healing, avoid playing games that involve too much excitement or heavy exercise (e.g. chasing or hunting games). Activity restriction is important, and will help to keep you pet's bandage or splint intact. Increase petting or grooming to keep your cat occupied and content during this time., Monitor your cat to make sure it doesn't chew on its wound dressing. If it does, your cat may need to wear an Elizabethan collar to cut off its access to the wound site. Contact your vet if your cat suddenly begins chewing its bandage or splint after previously leaving it alone, as this may indicate an infection or irritation.

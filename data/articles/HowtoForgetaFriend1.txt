 Keep in mind that a friendship with a best friend is a relationship just like a romantic relationship. Relationships have a beginning and, in many cases, an ending, and getting closure for the relationship will help you move past the friendship. Think about the good times you had together and the reasons you became friends in the first place.Look at old pictures to reminisce about some of your favorite times together.;
, Write to your former friend to explain your feelings. You might take this opportunity to explain the reasons why you are not friends anymore (if you ended the friendship).


You don’t need to actually send this letter if you don’t want to. If you do send it, don’t be malicious or mean in the letter. Be a mature person in this situation.
 It’s okay to get emotional about the loss of your friendship. Feeling sad about not having your friend in your life anymore is perfectly normal.

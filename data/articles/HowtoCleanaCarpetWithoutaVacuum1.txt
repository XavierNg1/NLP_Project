 You can buy carpet brushes or sweepers at home good stores. Take the brush across the carpet like you would with a hairbrush. This method is good for carpets that have longer fibers; you can reach deeply into the grain of the carpet and pull out dirt that’s trapped.Pick a brush that has stiffer bristles for short fiber carpets. Soft synthetic bristles won’t have enough tension or power to push dirt off.
A brush with metal teeth is good for faux fur rugs or very fine carpets. Be careful though as it may damage and separate a delicate weave.
Some brushes come on the end of long broom-like handles so you don’t have to clean on your knees.

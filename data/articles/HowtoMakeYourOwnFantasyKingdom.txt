 Coming up with your kingdom's name might be a little hard; if you're having trouble, take some name ideas from the kingdom itself! For example if your kingdom has a huge forest, you could call it "Green Shadows". You may choose to do this last if you wish.;
, You may choose to use your real name(For example, King Matthew the Strong) or make up a whole new name(Queen Matharian the Honorable). Your rank, how high of a position you have in a society, can be anywhere ranging from a peasant to a king.
 Design it however you want! You can have stables that hold animals, a village, a river, a treehouse, a castle- whatever you want.
 Buildings, animals, outlaws, or other people; You can have 3 moons and 50 suns in the sky if you want!

, Are there kingdoms opposing to yours? What are they called? Why are they trying to take over yours?

, Who is the king/queen? Are there princesses or princes? Ambassadors? What other branches of royalty are there? If you'd like, you can make leaders of villages, under the king, so it's like a village representative, who can make their own laws in the village.

 The best type of brush for suede would be a suede brush, which you can find in a suede cleaning kit. You can also use a clean toothbrush or a manicure brush.


If you are going to use a toothbrush or a manicure brush, plan on using them only for suede cleaning purposes. Do not use them for anything else.
 Gently brush the area using short, gentle strokes. Always go in the same direction. Do not go back and forth just yet. This will help loosen the fibers and dirt.
 This time, you can buff the stain using a back-and-forth motion. Do not be alarmed if your purse starts to "shed." This is simply the dirty fibers coming off.









Consider working over a towel to keep your lap or work surface clean.
 You can find these sponges in the cleaning and detergent section of a grocery store. Gently go back and forth over the affected area with the sponge until the dirt goes away.
 If your purse is a little bit dirty, you can try steam cleaning it. The easiest way to do this is to hang your purse up in the bathroom just after you take a hot shower. The damp air will be enough to loosen stains, but it won't be damp enough to stain your purse. After the steam cleaning, let your purse dry, then buff the affected area with a soft bristled brush.
 Dampen a washcloth with some white vinegar or rubbing alcohol first, then gently buff the stain with it. Let the affected area dry, then buff it again with the soft bristled brush. Unlike water, white vinegar and rubbing alcohol will not stain suede.









Don't worry about the vinegar smell; it will eventually go away.
Extra-stubborn stains may require a dedicated suede cleaning solution.
 As you continue to buff your purse, you may notice that some fibers are a lot longer than others. You can trim these down using a pair of scissors, or go over them with an electric razor

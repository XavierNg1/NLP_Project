 If you are using a quote that uses “I,” make sure to introduce the sentence by saying who said it: “As Hess said, ‘I like ice water’ (33).” Just quoting “I like ice water” could lead to confusion, even though you are using quotes.
 If you need to make a citation in a sentence where you are using first person (i.e. when you’re saying that you did something), make sure to delineate what came from the source and what you are saying.


Instead of “I used ice water to show evaporation (Hess 33).” you should say something to the effect of “Hess does an experiment on evaporation using ice water (33); in my research, I performed a similar experiment.” That way, the reader knows why you are making that citation.

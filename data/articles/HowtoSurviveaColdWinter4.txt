 Know where you are. Before you leave your starting point, advise a family member, friend or neighbor of your destination and judge the approximate duration of the trip. If possible, contact those persons if you will be delayed. Notify them when you reach your destination.
 If no such item can be found, apply a very large X on the roof section of the car cover. This can be achieved with vinyl, waterproof tape or take the car cover to an upholster to have a durable, highly reflective vinyl X sewn on. On the front and rear sides of the cover, use the same methods to apply your license plate number. When not in use, keep the car cover in the trunk.
 This will provide added traction while driving and the sand can be used around your tires if you become stuck.)
A camping shovel
At least one sleeping bag, preferably one that is down.
Water
Foodstuffs that can be eaten cold. (Described in Item number 4.)
A small First Aid kit
A small tool kit, a jack that works and a spare tire in usable condition, and jumper cables.
 If it has reception, call an emergency number first, then call the persons that are aware of your route and your travel time schedule. Test the cell phone periodically. Do not try to walk over for help. Exit the car ONLY to recover items from the trunk.
 Position the X on the roof the best you can. The car cover will help retain heat inside the car and repel the cold, wind, and drafts. If you are in a severe situation, the reflective X can be seen by aircraft that may be conducting a search for you. Your license plate numbers will be visible to a search and rescue team working on the ground.

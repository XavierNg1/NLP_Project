 The butterfly stretch is useful as a cooling down stretch. Before doing it, you will want to have done at least five to ten minutes of light to moderate cardio activity, such as walking or cycling. Stretches like this before you are warmed up can result in an injury.;
, Keep your legs in front, and sit up straight to elongate your spine.
 Your knees should bend and point outward. It may be easier to bring one in first, then the other to meet it. Make sure you are sitting upright, with your head above your spine., Hold on to your ankles and pull your feet towards your pelvis. Get as close as possible, but don't force the position beyond your comfort.
 Make sure your back stays straight. You can use your elbows to push gently on your thighs for a deeper stretch.If you are a beginner, you don't need to lean too far, just enough to feel the stretch. As you get more comfortable doing it, you may be able to lean further forward.
 Stay still in this pose, and don't bounce up and down, even slightly. If you start to feel extreme pain at any point then stop at that point for 30-40 seconds.
 To really make this effective, you will have to repeat the stretch. Hold the position for 30 seconds two to four times, depending on your tightness, flexibility, and comfort.

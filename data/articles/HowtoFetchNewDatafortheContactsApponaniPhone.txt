 You can find the Settings app on one of your Home screens. It may be located in a folder labeled "Utilities.";
, On older devices, this will be labeled "Mail, Contacts, Calendars."

,,, You'll see all of your connected accounts listed here, and you can have different fetch settings for each one.
 These options determine how often your iPhone updates contact information for that account.


Selecting Push will tell the account to automatically send new contact data as soon as it is available. For example, if you update a contact on your Mac, when the iPhone is set to push the contact will be updated immediately on the iPhone as well. Not all accounts support the Push option.
Selecting Fetch will set your iPhone to only check for updates periodically. If your iPhone is set to Fetch and you make a change to a contact on your Mac, the changes will only appear when the iPhone performs a scheduled data fetch.
Selecting Manual will only update contact data when the Contacts app is opened.
 This can be found in the upper-left corner, and will return you to the Fetch New Data screen.
 If you selected Fetch as the scheduling option, you can choose how often data is fetched. If you select "Manual" here, data will only be fetched when the Contacts app is opened.

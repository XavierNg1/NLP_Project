 Some of your tops might be more flattering to your chest than others. To ensure that you are making your breasts look as big as possible, choose tops that have the desired effect. Some good options include tops that have:Ruffles around or near the chest.
Lighter colors on top and darker colors on bottom.
Horizontal stripes around the chest area.
Gathered material or pleating around the neckline.
 Sitting or standing up tall can also make your breasts look larger and fuller.Try to remember to stand up and sit straight to ensure that your breasts will look as big as possible.


Try setting a reminder on your phone to “stand up straight.” Every time the reminder goes off, pull yourself up to your full height and push out your chest.
 Some carefully chosen accessories may also help to enhance your breasts. For example, you can choose items that draw the eye towards your chest, rather than away from it. Skip the dangly earrings and go for necklaces and brooches instead.


Try wearing necklaces that hang down to the area between your breasts or just above your cleavage. Or, try wearing a brooch right on the edge of a scoop neck or v-neck sweater.
 You can also use makeup to contour the areas just above your breasts, which can make it look like you have cleavage or enhance your existing cleavage.


To create the appearance of cleavage with makeup, use a light brown eyeliner to draw two arcs just above your breasts.
Then, use a fluffy brush to blend the lines with some matte bronzer.Use a bronzer that is a couple shades darker than what you would normally wear. Be sure to blend until the arcs are barely visible; they should provide just a shadow that resembles cleavage but not be too obvious.

 Small scratches in laminate furniture can be easily minimized by using specially designed touch-up markers. These markers are often packaged along with laminate furniture, but you can also find them at hardware stores and office supply stores that sell laminate office furniture. They are often sold in sets, but you should try to match the marker's color to your wood tone if you can purchase the markers individually.
 Use the touch-up marker in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Usually this will involve simply rubbing the marker's tip along the scratch a few times to fill it in.
 After some of the marker's ink has been deposited into the scratch, rub the area gently with a soft, clean cloth. This will help blend the color into the surrounding wood and will remove any excess ink.

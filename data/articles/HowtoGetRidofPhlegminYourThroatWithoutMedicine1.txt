 You can either buy lemon tea, or make yourself some warm lemon water by mixing 2 teaspoons of lemon juice with a cup of warm water. The acidity of the lemon juice breaks up the mucus. Adding a tablespoon of honey to the mixture soothes your throat.;
, Ever tried a bit of wasabi, only to have your nose start running uncontrollably? Spicy foods, such as horseradish or pepper, act as a decongestant and should help loosen up some of that noxious phlegm.
 Whether it's tea, chicken soup, or something in between, warm liquids will help nourish you while breaking up some of the mucus stuck in your throat.
 Mix 1/2 teaspoon of salt with a cup of warm water and gargle the mixture with your head tilted back.
 Toast is a good food to break phlegm and carry it down to your stomach. Toast scrapes the throat softly, removing some of the phlegm as it is ingested.
 If your body is producing a lot of phlegm, it may be because it is trying to ward off sickness, which means your immune system is working on overdrive. Give your body the water it needs to do its job.
 It won't taste amazing but it will work. Swallow it as quickly as you can, then wait for 5-10 seconds. If the taste is still there, drink some water.

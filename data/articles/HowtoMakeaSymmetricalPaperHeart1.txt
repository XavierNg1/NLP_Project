 It can be a rectangle or square-shaped piece of paper – either will work. For a classic, festive heart, use red, pink, or purple construction paper. If you want a big heart, then use a big paper.





;
, Start sketching from the paper crease, so that both the top and bottom of the heart come from the crease. When you cut out this line from each folded side of the paper, you will ensure that each half of the heart is perfectly symmetrical to the other.








The outline you draw will determine the final heart shape, so now is the time to decide the aesthetic fate of your paper heart.
Use a pencil if you plan to erase the line. Use a pen if you don't mind a dark border to your paper heart.
 Start from the crease—the top or bottom-center of the heart—and cut out the line you drew. Snip carefully, but don't worry too much about precision. Once you unfold your heart, each side will be symmetrical no matter how skewed your cut. Make sure that you are cutting both halves of the fold.








If you don't want the dark line to show on the finished heart: cut just inside the pencil mark, or carefully erase it later., You should have a symmetrical paper heart. You're now ready to give the heart to someone or use it in a larger craft project!

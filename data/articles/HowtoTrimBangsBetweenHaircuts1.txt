 You will need a fine-tooth comb and sharp hair-cutting scissors for trimming bangs. You will also need bobby pins and/or hair ties to tie or pin your hair back. This will ensure that you do not accidentally cut a section of hair you did not intend to cut.If you already have hair-cutting scissors, make sure that the pair you have are sharp. If not, you will need to get them sharpened. You can sharpen them at home, find a sharpening service in your area, or send them back to the manufacturer for sharpening if they offer it.;
, Cutting your own hair requires focus and precision. You will want to make sure that you have some quiet time to yourself to perform this task. Budget about half an hour in your schedule to devote solely to trimming your bangs.


Avoid being in a rush. Make sure that you have plenty of down time and do not have to be somewhere before trimming your bangs. This is not a process that you want to rush.
 You will always want to trim your bangs while they are dry. This is because wet hair is longer and hair shrinks as it dries. Cutting your bangs while they are wet will leave you with bangs that are shorter than you intended., Use a fine-tooth comb to separate your bangs from the rest of your hair. Pull the rest of it back into a ponytail or pin the rest back with clips. Make sure that any sections of your hair that you do not want to cut are safely pulled back or pinned.
 The small hairs that fall as you trim can be itchy and difficult to brush off the skin. Drape a towel around your shoulders. Secure the towel in place with some hair clips. Hair clips can be obtained at any drugstore or beauty supply store near you.

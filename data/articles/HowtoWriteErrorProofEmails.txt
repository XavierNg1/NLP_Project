 The original spell check was the exclusive province of word processors, but now many of these modern innovations have moved to hosted email platforms. That makes checking spelling and grammar for email as easy as clicking in the corner of an open message tool bar. Grammar and spell check can be one of the most effective ways to get typos and errors out of an email before hitting send.;
, To decrease chances of grammatical or spelling errors, or any other kinds of immediate mistakes, build a framework for emails that makes much of the writing automatic, allowing the rider to focus on the quantity of emails without worrying about quality.


Develop an IBC approach. This old standard of Introduction, Body and Conclusion works well for an email. Template each of these three parts separately, and provide a good basis for quick and accurate emailing in the future.
 For some, punctuation is one of the primary problems with creating professional emails. Keep good desk references on hand that give rules about when to use the comma, period and other parts of the English language that are neither consonants nor vowels.
 These like-sounding words will trip many people up, and spell check will not catch them.


Take a look at the most common homophones and immunize yourself against errors. Spend time working with word pairs like "you're" and "your," "their" and "they're, not to mention "there," and other common tricky articles and pronouns.
 For accuracy with the big four-dollar words, keep a paper dictionary or an online reference handy.
 Make sure that the errors in your emails are not related to actual facts by having all of the materials cited at hand.


Refer to paper documents or other good sources for emails based on upcoming events or other relevant topics. Going by memory often gets email writers in trouble when their relayed messages end up being inaccurate. A better-safe-than-sorry approach can help tighten up most emails.

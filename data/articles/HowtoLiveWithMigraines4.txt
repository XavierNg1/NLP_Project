 If your migraines are frequent enough, your doctor might suggest a prescription for migraine medication. These types of medication include triptans, or over-the-counter medication like ibuprofen. You should generally take this medication at the first sign of a migraine. They can have serious side effects, however, so be sure you track how you’re feeling when you take the medication., Migraines can sometimes be treated by alternating hot and cold pads on the side of your head that’s affected. Place a hot pad or washcloth on the affected side for ten minutes, then swap it out for a cold pad or washcloth. You can repeat this as often as necessary if it seems to bring you relief.Sitting with your hands and feet submerged in hot water, while you have a cold compress on your head, can also help alleviate migraine symptoms.
 If you have a migraine, try not to focus just on your head. Getting a full-body massage (or asking your partner to give you one), or practicing tai chi or yoga can help your body relax and relieve some of the tension causing your migraines., Light can be both a trigger and an exacerbating factor with migraines. If you have a migraine, it’s best to avoid light of any kind. This means overhead lighting, natural light, and the light that comes from any type of screen. Lying in a dark room can go a long way to helping cure a migraine.

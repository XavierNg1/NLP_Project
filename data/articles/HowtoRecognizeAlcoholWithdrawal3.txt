 Those who suffer from this disease will struggle with cravings and loss of control. The goal is stay in control and manage your desire. Be persistent in your resistance to drinking and prepare yourself for an ongoing mental battle.
 Perhaps you began abusing alcohol in order to cope with these or other conditions. Addressing the underlying mental health issues that may have led you to drink is an important way of preventing future relapses.


When seeking treatment be sure to speak with a professional who can help you weigh your options. You want to evaluate what works best for you personally and supports your success.
 Share with them what youâ€™re going through and how difficult it is to quit drinking. Ask them to help you fight your addiction. Getting their support can help you overcome your addiction.


In addition to friends and family, talk to others in the same boat as you. Join Alcoholics Anonymous, Moderation Management, or another organization that helps you meet other alcoholics and stay sober.
Your friends and family might not know how to help you. Direct them to Al-Anon or Adult Children of Alcoholics so they can better understand your struggles and give you the support you need.

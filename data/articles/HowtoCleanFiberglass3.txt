 Inhaling fiberglass dust, which is produced whenever fiberglass is damaged, cut, broken or sanded, can be dangerous. Though the irritation from fiberglass dust is temporary, it is also very unpleasant.Exposure to the fibers and the dust in fiberglass can produce skin, eye or respiratory tract irritation. It does not cause long-term problems in most cases, but can lead to painful irritation.
This exposure could become serious depending on the length of exposure and the size of the fibers that one comes in contact with. Fiberglass dust can cause internal damage, though this is extremely rare when only cleaning fiberglass.
 Fiberglass can also cause skin irritation. It can even leave a rash on your skin in the case of long-term exposure.Wear long sleeves and clean clothes each time you're working with cleaning fiberglass. The long sleeves should prevent your arms from being exposed, while clean clothes will make sure you don't retain any fiberglass dust on your person.
Minimize the amount of bare skin that can be exposed to fiberglass. Gloves, long sleeves, and pants are necessary when working intensively with fiberglass.
Launder clothes worn when cleaning fiberglass separately from your other clothes. Fiberglass dust can get into your other clothes if you're not careful.
 Eye irritation and damage is also a serious problem with fiberglass. Eye irritation can be much more serious than inhaling fiberglass dust, since it is more likely to cause permanent damage.


Particles from fiberglass can get into your eyes and irritate them. Wearing goggles should minimize the contact with fiberglass and keep your eyes safe.
Sharper fiberglass fragments can also severely damage your eyes if you do not protect them. They can cut your eyes and even lead to long-term damage or issues.

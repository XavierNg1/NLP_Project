 Many people who deal with anxiety sweating get caught in a vicious cycle: they worry about sweating, which in turn causes anxiety and makes them sweat, which makes them worry even more about their sweating. If this happens to you, it's time to break the cycle! Remind yourself that sweating is perfectly normal and not a big deal at all so you won't get so anxious about it., Exercise releases endorphins in your body, which can help reduce anxiety. Incorporating regular exercise, such as jogging, into your schedule can help you stay calm and manage your anxiety.Keep in mind that most forms of exercise will cause you to sweat, so only exercise when you know you will have time to shower afterwards.
 When you begin to experience anxiety, you can work to fight it off by practicing relaxation techniques. These techniques will help divert attention from your anxiety, helping your anxiety-related symptoms (including sweating) subside faster.Many people find deep breathing very helpful for reducing anxiety. This technique forces you to focus your attention on your breathing so that you no longer focus on the thoughts that are triggering your anxiety.
Visualizing calmness may also help. Simply imagine a situation in which you would be very calm, and try to replace all of the anxious thoughts you are having with thoughts about the calm situation.
 If you are unable to control your anxiety on your own, make an appointment with a therapist who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy. This kind of therapy will help you recognize the source of your anxiety and learn effective techniques for combating it.Your therapist may also recommend that you take medications to help control your anxiety.

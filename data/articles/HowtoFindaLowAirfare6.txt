 Say you’re flying from New York to Eleuthera in the Bahamas. Check on one of the big sites like Expedia or Orbitz for a single fare (for example, JFK to Governor’s Harbor, Bahamas) and then do two separate searches (JFK to Nassau and Nassau to Governor’s Harbor). Since JetBlue flies JFK/Nassau you’ll want to check JetBlue.com separately). Chances are, the two-fare strategy will save you a lot of cash. This fare trick also works for flights to Europe (fly into London or Manchester, UK on one fare and then hop on a discount European airline to reach your final destination) and Asia. To search route possibilities on these discounters, check out the Airfarewatchdog route maps page.


Note, however, that this approach is quite a gamble that only pays off if you manage to make your connecting flight on time. If you don't, it's your problem as opposed to the airlines', to provide hotel accommodation and a new connecting flight. Even in a best-case scenario, you'll need extra layover time to be able to claim and recheck your luggage.

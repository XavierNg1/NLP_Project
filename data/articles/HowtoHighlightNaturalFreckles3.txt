 Apply small amounts of sheer bronzer on areas the sun would naturally hit, like cheekbones, forehead and nose. The right amount can complement freckles, but donâ€™t overboard; too much can overpower them. Also, stay away from overly sparkly ones and use a cream or gel bronzer when in doubt.
 Contouring is not a makeup technique well suited for freckles. It creates a lot of heavy coverage and the darker shades involved in contouring can make your freckles look muddy. Skip it and embrace other makeup trends.
 Create a glow and make your cheekbones pop by applying a tiny bit of vaseline in just the right places. Use a small amount on the bridge of your nose and brow bone.
 A liquid illuminator product will make your skin glow without making you look like a disco ball with freckles. Mix a little into your regular foundation or apply some to the tops of cheekbones, the corners of your eyes or in the middle of your lips.

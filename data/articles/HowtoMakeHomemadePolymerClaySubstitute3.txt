 This recipe is very popular in Latin America and makes useful clay. Many recipes call for 10% formaldehyde or formalin but this has been replaced with white vinegar in this recipe for a safer, non-toxic version., First mix 1 cup cornstarch with ½ cup water in a Teflon-coated pot over low heat until it is completely dissolved. Once the cornstarch has dissolved, add and mix in the 1 cup glue.
 Add 1.5 tablespoons (22.2 ml) of glycerin, 1.5 tablespoons cold cream with lanolin and 1.5 tablespoons (22.2 ml) white vinegar to the pot. Continue cooking on low heat while stirring constantly until a dough forms and begins to come away from the sides of the pot.


Be very careful not to overcook or else the dough will harden.
Glycerin is a common baking ingredient that you should be able to find in the baking section of the supermarket.
Find cold cream with lanolin in the cosmetics section of the store.
 Allow the dough to cool with a damp cloth used as covering. Once you can handle the dough knead it into a smooth clay consistency. It is ready to be molded however you wish.


Allow your creation to dry for at least three days in the air.
Oil paints and acrylics can be used to paint your creation once you have allowed it to dry.
 Store in plastic wrap and keep in a cool, dark place.

 Use a mild shampoo or beard cleanser to wash your beard several times per week.Be sure to rinse the shampoo out thoroughly because residue can cause drying and flaking.


You can use a conditioner to make your beard feel softer if you want to. Apply it to your beard after shampooing and be sure to rinse well.
After cleansing, use a soft towel to gently pat your beard dry. Avoid rubbing your beard vigorously with a towel, since this can cause split ends and frizz.
 Use a good moisturizer that contains sunscreen to hydrate and protect your skin from sun damage. Dab a small amount of moisturizer onto your face, then gently massage it into the skin all over your face and beneath your beard.









After shaving your neck area with a razor, apply a little more moisturizer there, too.
 Then use a quality beard brush with boar bristles to distribute natural oils properly. This will prevent greasiness and add shine. A daily brushing will keep your beard looking neat and also helps train the hairs to grow in a downward direction., Whenever you spot one, put a hot towel over it for a minute or two to open up the pore. Dab a small amount of alcohol onto a cotton ball and disinfect the area around the hair. Then use a pair of clean, sharp tweezers to pull it out. Try to grab the hair as close to its base as you can.


Avoid jerking at the hair from the top, which might fail to remove the hair and instead split it in half.
Never pick or squeeze ingrown hairs. This can lead to infection and permanent scarring.

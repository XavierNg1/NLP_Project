 Put the coconut milk, sugar, and vanilla in a blender and blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Taste the mixture and add a little more sugar or vanilla if desired.A note about coconut milk: this ice cream tastes best with full fat coconut milk. Be sure to use coconut milk, and not cream of coconut, which is a different product. Coconut milk naturally separates during storage. Scoop the entire contents of the cans into your blender.

Optional: add 1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum to the mixture. This is completely optional, but it will result in a final texture that's less "icy" and more similar to traditional ice cream.
 Place it in your refrigerator and chill the mixture completely before proceeding. Starting with a chilled mixture will make it easier to achieve the light, fluffy texture of ice cream.
 Pour it into your ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. In most cases you will be instructed to transfer the churned ice cream to the freezer for a few hours until it firms up and become scoopable.


If you don't have an ice cream maker, freeze it as follows: pour the chilled custard into a shallow baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze it for 45 minutes, then unwrap it and stir the custard to whip some air into the mixture. Wrap it back up, put it in the freezer and repeat every 45 minutes until the mixture is frozen and scoopable. The more frequently you stir, the lighter and fluffier your ice cream will be.

 This method shows two ways to restart Firefox in "Safe Mode," with all of your add-ons disabled.;
, This icon looks like three horizontal grey bars. It is located on the far right of your screen, on the same bar as your address bar (URL). A small menu should open up when you click it.Alternatively, click Help → Restart with Add-ons disabled in the top menu, and skip down to "continue in safe mode."

, Click the small, round question mark icon at the bottom of the menu you just opened. This will open the Help menu. A list of options should appear when you click the question mark icon.
 Select Restart with Add-ons disabled. Firefox will close and reopen immediately.


Take a screenshot or bookmark this page to continue using these instructions after Firefox is closed.
 When Firefox restarts, a pop-up should appear. To enter safe mode, click Continue in safe mode.
 If Safe Mode fixes your problem, it is probably caused by an add-on. Close Firefox and open it again normally. Use the top menu to access Tools → Add-ons, and disable the add-on you think may be causing problems. Continue to restart Firefox and disable different add-ons until the one causing the bug is isolated.
 If Safe Mode does not fix your problem, you can delete all your saved preferences, bookmarks, password, and add-ons by returning Firefox to its default state. Repeat the steps above to restart Firefox in Safe Mode again. This time, instead of "Continue in Safe Mode," press Reset Firefox.


If you see a list of checkboxes instead, you are using Firefox version 14 or below.You can check all of these boxes for a similar effect, but updating to the latest Firefox may be an easier way to fix some bugs.
If you only see the "Continue in Safe Mode" option, try switching to the default profile and trying again.Your data will be saved in a new folder called "Old Firefox Data". If you creating a new firefox profile, you can transfer the harmless data over.

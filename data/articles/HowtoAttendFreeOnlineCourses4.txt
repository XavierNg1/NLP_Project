 It is important to have a place to keep all the educational material you collect during your course. Have a clearly named folder on your desktop with all the electronic files you acquire, and have a tangible folder to hold printouts and notes.
 Online courses will almost always have a portal or dashboard that offers a personalized page you can access by enrolling and/or logging in. Platforms will vary widely. Get used to the online interface as soon as you begin a class by spending time simply examining all of the pages, sections, and links associated with your class.


These user-specific (or class-specific) page with likely provide the materials you need (or information on how to get these materials).
Take advantage of supplementary material. These will include links to outside references and other helpful materials.
 If they hold classes that you can video conference in on, definitely do so! Many classes will also organize chatrooms or blogs that are open to others in the same course. Use these to ask questions or begin conversations about course material.


Join study groups. Study groups will likely include video meetings or live chat sessions. If there is not already a study group of one sort or another associated with your class, start one! You and many of your classmates will benefit from collaborating, and will likely learn the course material more quickly.

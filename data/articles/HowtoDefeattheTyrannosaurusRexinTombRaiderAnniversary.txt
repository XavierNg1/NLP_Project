 There will be a cutscene before the actual battle. During the cutscene, there will be two parts involving you. When the glowing white arrows appear, press the required keys W/S/A/D (I have only played on PC, but the rule goes for all gaming systems) depending on where the arrow is pointing.;
, (Note: The Tyrannosaurus' rage bar at the top right of your screen) it will increase the more you shoot at the Tyrannosaurus. The Tyrannosaurs battles by advancing on you, chomping, and slashing with his tail. He's slow, so he's easy to avoid.
 If you have time, move to stand in front of a spiked bar. Once the screen turns blurry, use the Adrenaline Dodge (going either left or right) while locked on the Tyrannosaur. The moment it strikes red, shoot at him. The Tyrannosaur will fumble, and ram into the spiked bar (if Lara is standing in front of one) causing extreme damage to the Tyrannosaur. You can also defeat the Tyrannosaur without the use of the spiked bars in case you can't get to one in time; however, it takes longer time to defeat the Tyrannosaur.
 Eventually the Tyrannosaur's health will decrease all the way, and you can continue Lara's adventure.

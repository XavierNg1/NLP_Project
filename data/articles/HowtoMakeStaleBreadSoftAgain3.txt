 Microwaves do soften bread, but the results aren't perfect. Within a few minutes, the bread usually turns rubbery and even tougher than before.This is the fastest method, but it's best to save it for an immediate snack.


This happens because the microwave boils away some of the water. The escaping steam pushes the starches into a denser structure, and leaves the bread dry. Slow heating in small increments can reduce this effect, but it's difficult to find a sweet spot that's still hot enough to soften the bread.
 Lightly dampen a plain, white paper towel. Wrap it around your bread.This adds more moisture, and traps some of the steam in the bread to keep it soft.
 Depending on how strong your microwave is, the bread might already be soft after ten seconds. If not, try again, checking frequently.

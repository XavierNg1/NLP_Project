 Meanwhile, pull out a large baking pan and set aside.
 Use a strong serrated kitchen knife to cut the squash in half from end to end. Remove the stringy pulp and seeds from the center of each half.


Make sure that any dirt or debris has been scrubbed off the skin with water and a vegetable brush before cutting it.
An acorn squash can be difficult to cut. Consider cutting the squash on a rubber mat to help steady it if you have difficulty.
Use a sturdy metal spoon or ice cream scoop to remove the seeds and strings from the squash.
Score the inside of the flesh by cutting several shallow slits into it. Doing so will allow the flavors to seep further into the squash, leading to a stronger, sweeter flavor.
 Add 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) water to the bottom of the baking pan.


Do not get any water inside the squash.
Water prevents the skins from burning, and it also helps to prevent the flesh from drying out.
The squash halves should be side-by-side in a single layer, and both should be cut-side-up.
 Evenly spread 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) butter over each half. Follow by adding 1 Tbsp (15 ml) brown sugar to the hollow center of each half, and drizzle 1 tsp (5 ml) of maple syrup over each half.


If using unsalted butter, you should also sprinkle a dash of salt over the squash halves after coating them with butter.
 The squash should be very tender and the exposed tops should be browned.


Do not cover the squash as it bakes.
The total baking time may range from 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes.
Avoid undercooking the squash.
 Let the acorn squash cool slightly after you pull it out of the oven before serving it.


If some of the butter and sugar mixture has not been absorbed into the flesh of the squash, you can spoon the excess over exposed areas of the flesh.

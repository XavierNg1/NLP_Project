 Remove the leafy, papery part of the onion until you’ve reached the solid, white area.;

Use a sharp knife––this is essential for making clean cuts, and be sure to hold the onion firmly in place as you cut.
Select the larger rings from the onion to become the egg “mold.” Typically, these will be found the closer to the center of the onion. Refrigerate the rest until the next time you need onions.
 Just a light dusting will do the trick. Don’t over season as you will be adding more seasoning after the eggs have cooked.
 By cracking the egg into the bowl first, you can remove any shells or avoid having a bad egg drop into your onion rings.
 Place the skillet over medium heat and give it a few minutes to heat up before adding food.
 Allow the rings to cook and brown lightly before adding the egg. If possible, you may want to turn the rings over a few times so both sides cook evenly.


The onion may start to brown. Add the eggs right before the onion turns to a darker shade of brown (because it may burn while the egg cooks if you add the egg too late).
 Gently allow the egg to slide from the bowl into the middle of the ring.



Sprinkle a teaspoon of water into the skillet and cover with a lid to steam the eggs and onion.
 Slide it underneath one egg and onion ring.


Lift carefully from the skillet and onto your plate.

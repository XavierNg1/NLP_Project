 As much as your parents may want you to conform to the ideal child, you should still be yourself at all times, and be true to who you are. Also, if you’re desperately trying to fit in with a certain group of people, make sure that you don’t pretend to be something that you’re not.


Be willing to be your own individual without be ashamed of any quirks and unique interests.
Be a leader instead of follower.
Don’t ignore your conscience or your instinct, even if it goes against what’s popular or the norm.
If you feel different from everybody else, don’t be afraid to embrace it and express it.
 Even when your parents and peers are not exactly praising you or celebrating your accomplishments, be proud of yourself.


Give yourself a pat on the back when you achieve a personal goal.
Ignore negativity and discouraging words that minimize who you are and what you’ve accomplished.
Reward yourself by treating yourself to something special when you overcome an obstacle.
 Maybe you don’t consider yourself talented or athletic, but try out for the drama team or a sport to see if you have what it takes. Most of things simply require practice.


Write down the things that you want to do and achieve, then post it on your mirror or bedroom door.
Try. Read the poem “It’s Better To Try And Fail Than Never To Try At All.”

, Realize that your parents may have unrealistic expectations and will never be satisfied when it comes to you. In fact, you may already be working hard to please your parents, only to find out that you can’t please them no matter what you do. Just remember that all you can do is your best.


Decide which expectations you can meet and which ones you can’t.Avoid harboring feelings of guilt or shame when you fell to meet an expectation. Always forgive yourself.
Always know that you’re good enough.

 Most larger community-created websites (such as Reddit) have one or more dedicated music communities. Lurk (observe quietly) and learn the community etiquette before you post.


Sharing music through a forum is no more legal than sharing through torrents. The appeal of using a forum is that they are much less likely to be taken down or pursued by authorities due to the members-only nature of forums.
 Depending on the site you visit, these may happen rarely, or multiple times daily. Once you find one, enter it.
 You'll see people posting albums with hyperlinks to sites like Mega, Zippyshare, and Mediafire. Those links lead to direct downloads of the albums in question.


Copy the link and paste it into a new tab. When prompted, click to download the file.
 Once the file finishes downloading, scan it for viruses with your antivirus software, just in case. This is usually an option in your right-click menu when you click on the file.
 Once everything seems fine, open the file and extract the music files inside. You won't be expected to share it with anyone as you would with a torrent.
 Once you're comfortable with your community, it is fine to ask for music in case other users have it. However, you're likely to get a much better response if you offer to upload an album of your own first.

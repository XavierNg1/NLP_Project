 Your first step in determining whether your loved one had life insurance is to gather all documents related to their death.


For example, get a copy of their will, if they had one, and death certificate. Some people put information about life insurance policies in their wills. These documents may also help with your search for more information.Often a court will decide the validity of a will and supervise the distribution of a deceased person's assets. This is called "probating."If your loved oneâ€™s estate has been probated, you can look at the probate records to see if the life insurance policy came up as an asset.;
, If you have access to your loved one's financial papers, look through them for evidence of a life insurance policy.Pay close attention to any paperwork related to insurance. It is possible that you can find a life insurance policy bundled with other policies you already know about. Many people bundle life insurance with car or home insurance., Look for evidence that your loved one made premium payments. Look at bill payments, cancelled checks, and bank statements for any sign of insurance payments.


Also check credit card statements for the past several years. Some policy holders will pay premiums with credit.
 Many people keep important documents in a safe deposit box, in case of burglary or fires. If your loved one had a safe deposit box, check it for any important financial documents.

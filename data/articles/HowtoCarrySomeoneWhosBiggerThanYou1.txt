 Ask your friend to stand next to you, facing your right shoulder. You'll be picking him up with the "fireman's carry," which can make it surprisingly easy.;
, Shift your right leg so it is between your friend's feet. Put more weight on this leg, so it is ready to support your friend.
 Bring your left hand across your chest to grasp your friend's right wrist or forearm. Lift your friend's arm over your head and duck forward, placing it across your neck and shoulders.When finished, you should be bent forward slightly, with our left hand back on your left side. Maintain a firm grip on your friend's arm.
 Carefully move your right arm off the other person. Now squat slightly, keeping your back as straight as you can while supporting the weight of the larger person. When you're low enough to reach his legs, slip your right arm between his knees. Grasp the back and side of his right knee with your hand.


Your left hand should keep a firm grip on his right arm this whole time.
 You should now have a firm grip on his right forearm and the back of his right knee. Use these grips to pull him onto your shoulders. When you're finished, he should be positioned like this:


His legs dangle in front of your right shoulder. Your hand is firmly and easily gripping one knee.
His torso is mostly straight across your shoulders.
His right arm is pulled in front of you.
 Lift with your legs and hips, never your back. Keep your back as straight as possible, bent forward just enough to support your friend. If necessary, adjust your friend to balance his weight more evenly.
 Move your friend's right arm across your chest. With your other hand, let go of your friend's knee and wrap your arm around his leg. Grasp your friend's right arm with your right hand. Your left hand should now be free to help you balance as you walk around.

Make sure to use both shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair clean and healthy.
To be extra-thorough, you can try using a waterproof hairbrush while conditioning.
If your hair is either wavy or curly, you might want to try using a straightening product as well.;
, You want your hair to remain damp for styling. For extra volume, use a root-boosting spray, but be careful to only spray the roots themselves. Root-booster allows you to use less hairspray, so you won't end up with stiff or sticky hair.

 You won't always have time to buy items before a hurricane strikes, especially when the storm is imminent, so you'll want to store the necessary items in your home well in advance.
 This should include dried foods that you can rehydrate with bottled water and non-perishable foods. Include a manual can opener and any other supplies you might want to use to prepare food in the event you lose power and access to supplies for an extended period of time.
 You should have bottled water on hand. Some people will clean and rinse their bathtubs and fill them with tap water to use as additional drinking water during a hurricane.
 These will come in handy if clothes are soiled or ruined due to floodwaters or debris.
 You may want to store these in waterproof containers or a safe as well.
, Have a radio that can work with battery power so you can monitor the storm and keep up with the latest hurricane advisories. You may also want a first aid kit, extra batteries and a flashlight.
 You may need to modify an area of your home during your hurricane preparation. Others will be able to use an area in the home without windows that will be safe from flooding.

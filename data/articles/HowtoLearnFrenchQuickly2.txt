 The combination of audio, video, and text in subtitled videos makes them a powerful learning tool as they engage many learning styles. Try to watch at least thirty minutes each day.


Do not choose a romantic comedy when you prefer science fiction. Look for films that you’ll enjoy watching so that the language learning process is pleasant.
Memorize a few of the simple sentences in the films you watch to learn useful new phrases.
If you want to watch TV programs instead of (or in addition to) French films, search online for ones you’ll enjoy. For instance, you could run a search for “French baseball game” if you enjoy baseball. Whatever video you choose, ensure it has subtitles.
Put the videos on your phone or tablet so you can watch them on the bus or train.
 When you have trouble with vocabulary, use a French-English dictionary. Alternately, change the subtitles to English so you can get the meaning of the sentence before reading the French subtitles.


You don’t need to progress in a linear way through the film from start to finish. Feel free to skip around within the film to learn dialogue relevant to your interests.
 Write the date at the top of each new entry in the notebook so you can track your progress and easily locate a sentence that you want to review from a prior session. Number your sentences so you know when you’ve written between 20 and 30. Read each word out loud as you write it.
 If you have trouble with a particular sentence or word, read it out loud multiple times until you feel comfortable with it. This will ensure you get important practice speaking French as well as writing and reading it.

 Be specific about what you want done at the beginning of the appointment. If you still don't like it, explain to your stylist what it is that you want and what she/he is not doing. If you want a certain look bring pictures from a magazine. Most hair stylists are cool about adjusting their work to meet customer specifications. If the stylist acts like a total prima donna about it, then she/he is making it all the more easy for you to leave.;
, It is, after all, your money and your hair. The beauty industry is about making the customer feel better about his/herself.
 You're the one who has to look at yourself in the mirror everyday. If the advice your hairdresser gives you doesn't work, don't let him/her change your mind.
 See what another hairdresser thinks of your hair. Some of them will consult with you.
 You could just start going to another salon and be polite to them if you ever see each other again in public.
 If you are friends with the person, let them know what you like about them, but that you think it's better to go with someone else.

 You will only need:Scissors.
Paper (best if it is somewhat rigid).
Tape

, Any size will do, but obviously a small sheet of paper will make a small hoop.
 You will create a crease that ends at the midpoint of the top and bottom sides.
 Make sure that you make all of your folds in the same direction; in other words, do not make one fold toward you and the other fold away from you. All of the creases (including those in the next step) must leave an imprint on the paper point the same direction.
 Make sure that each corner and the sides match up perfectly as you fold. The paper should now have four creases in it, and will almost take a pyramid shape if left to sit on its own. It will only come together correctly if all four of the creases meet at a single central point.
 Do not bent against the creases you created earlier. As you bend the four together, the diagonal creases will flow outward. The paper should appear to be a triangle if looked at from the side and a four-pointed star if viewed from above.
 You may be able to get the hoop to maintain its shape just by flexing the paper (especially if the paper is rigid). If the paper will not maintain the hoop shape on its own, you can tape the tips together.


The tip of the triangle or pyramid from earlier is now usually considered the top. As you fold the tips together you may note how easily they form a basket that opens wider toward the top.
 Again, masking tape usually works best.

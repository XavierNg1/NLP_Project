 Since the bathroom is (most likely) one of the smaller rooms in your home, you want an oil scent that is calming and soothing. Avoid overly pungent or powerful oils, which may still mask any odor but may be unpleasant to some.;
, You don’t have to be limited to only one essential oil. Mix and match compatible scents for your own air freshening “potion.”

, Look for a pumpkin spice around in autumn and a pine scent during the winter holiday season. Add compatible hand soap or a scented candle to complete the motif.
 Consider encircling the inside of the roll with your oil, especially if it's a “slow flow” bottle.
 Let the oil permeate and soak into the cardboard for best results.
 Every time the roll moves, a little of the essential oil should be released.

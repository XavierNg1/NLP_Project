 When raiding an enemy base, nighttime is the right time. Daytime is the worst time because your enemy could easily spot you. If you want to, dusk and dawn are the next best times, but the full moon provides just enough light to guide you while not revealing you to your enemies. This is the most quiet method for the fearful ones.
 You will be invisible but hide your sword just in case. Armor and tools show up during invisibility.
 Time to sneak in! Tunnel in through the base by a 6 block high and as many as the blocks until the floor wide. Poke a tunnel upwards otherwise and replace the hole with any block. Since you are invisible the enemy will not see you.

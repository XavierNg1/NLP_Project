 This question is not your hypothesis. Rather, it's the beginning of the scientific method which can lead to your hypothesis. Basically, the question is just something you wonder about when it comes to the natural universe. It can be as simple as, "I wonder why water is clear." or "What fish do cats like best?"Your question should be about something that can be studied and observed.;
, Once you've decided what you want to study, it's time to gather data. Generally, you gather data through observation of the phenomenon, but you also might gather data by reading what other people have observed and written about., Make a statement about what you think is happening with what you're observing. Because this statement is a hypothesis, you're not saying it's 100 percent true. Rather, you're saying this statement is your best guess right now, but you're going to conduct experiments to find out if it's true.For instance, maybe after observing cats, you decided that they may like salmon the best. Your hypothesis could be, "Cats prefer salmon over other fish."

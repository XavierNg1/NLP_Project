 A digital tympanic thermometer measures the infrared heat waves from your baby's eardrum. These thermometers have a narrowed tip that is inserted into the outer ear canal. Many come with protective plastic coverings that you can discard after each reading.Tympanic thermometers are best for babies over six months old. The ear canals of babies younger than six months are too small to get accurate readings.
 The thermometer should be on when you insert the tip and direct it toward the baby's opposite eye. If your baby is over one year old, you should also pull the baby's earlobe slightly outward before you insert the thermometer. This will straighten the ear canal for an accurate reading.Many tympanic thermometers will make a sound or alert you if the thermometer isn't inserted correctly or if it can't take an accurate reading. Be sure to read your owner's manual.
 Depending on your thermometer, you may need to wait a few seconds before pressing a button to record the temperature. Your digital thermometer may work without you needing to press anything. Either way, the thermometer will probably beep when a temperature is taken. Remove the thermometer and record the temperature.If your baby has been outside on a chilly day, wait 15 minutes before checking the temperature. Don't worry if your baby has tubes in its ears or earwax since these shouldn't affect the temperature reading.
Note also that the temperature may not be accurate if your baby has an ear infection on the side you take it.

 Even if you clean your cutting board after each use, it's important to give it a more intense treatment every once in a while. A bleach solution will kill more ingrained germs than simple soap and water can. This deep clean is especially important if you use your wooden cutting board for meat, poultry, or other high-risk foods.
 If it isn't, scrub it down with hot, soapy water, then rinse with a wet paper towel or rag. Pat dry with paper towels or a clean rag, or air-dry with the cutting board on its side. You don't want there to be any extra food on the board while you're trying to sanitize it.
 In a spray bottle, combine 1 teaspoon liquid bleach with one quart of water. Make sure the cap is firmly on the bottle, then give it a good shake to make sure the ingredients are evenly combined.If you don’t have an ammonium-based bleach, or are scared to use it near food, you can use hydrogen peroxide instead. A pre-mixed 3% solution works well., Use the spray bottle to distribute a thin layer of the solution over the cutting board’s surface. Allow it to sit for ten minutes or so, then rinse the cutting board’s surface under running water. Be careful not to get any of the bleach onto your clothes or kitchen surfaces. Shake off any excess water, then repeat on the other side.


If you’re using hydrogen peroxide instead of a bleach solution, pour a little onto a paper towel and carefully wipe it over the surface of the cutting board instead. Allow to sit, then rinse., This step is optional, but will get the board extra clean and deodorized. Afterwards, set the cutting board on its side to dry. , Bleach can dry out a natural material like wood, but a fresh coat of oil can help prevent this. Simply rub a small amount of mineral oil across the surface of the cutting board and let it soak in for a few minutes, then wipe up any excess with a rag or paper towel.

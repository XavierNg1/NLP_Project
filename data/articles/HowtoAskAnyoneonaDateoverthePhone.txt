 Skip this step if the person you are calling is your boyfriend/girlfriend.;
, More often than not, a person will call another without knowing what to say.If you are unprepared, then you could create an awkward silence. Avoid this by writing out what you're going to say and rehearsing. (See Tips.) Still act natural though!

, Asking a person out without knowing where to go will hurt you when the day comes and make you less confident. If it is a movie or a concert then mention the time as well.
 Start up a conversation first. Once you feel comfortable talking to the person, go ahead and start with your rehearsed conversation.
 If there is a silence longer than fifteen seconds *Don't count, of course*, then say "It's OK if you don't want to..." or "You don't have to tell me now."

, If the person on the other side says no, but does want to go out with you some other time, try again! Tell the person that you understand. Don't get angry, rude or sullen.
 Congratulations! You have just asked a person out over the phone.

 These types of skill-based training courses not only help you defend yourself physically against aggressors, but they also teach you to avoid potentially harmful environments, how to read potentially unsafe people, and how to de-escalate a fight before it starts.
 Gaining physical strength and mastery can help you to project self-confidence rather than weakness.
 Never fear looking like a wimp or loser for retreating from a bully. Practice flight rather than fight. Saving your life is far more important than saving face with schoolmates.
 Avoid a fight whenever you can because there is no way to control whether someone will get hurt or injured. Plus, if you engage in a fight, you may end up getting in trouble or suspended from school, too.


Only fight back when you are in immediate danger of being harmed or when you are in an environment when you cannot call for help.
In cases where defending yourself physically cannot be avoided, stand with your legs wide and guard your face with your arms and hands. If a bully sees you preparing to defend yourself, this may catch the person off guard. The bully may decide that a fight is not worth it, after all., Gaining the courage and strength to defend yourself against bullies can be empowering. However, you should never use your new-found confidence against others and become a bully yourself.

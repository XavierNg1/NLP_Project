 You need to remember this is not a long range gun, this is one of the worst guns you could use in a long range battle. It is best used in enclosed spaces with little places to run.;
, This gun can really chew up some ammo if you're not careful. Get an M9 with this gun because they share bullets.
 This gun is best if you have the red dot scope on it, this way, the shots are more accurate and about every bullet is perfectly placed. The silencer is also a good one for a ghost or ninja-like class.
 This gun is not loud, so don't be scared to take on large groups. This gun can also be used to get in, kill enemy, get out and heal up!

, This gun is better if you attack from behind so they can't shoot you. This gun fires fast, but the M16's bullets do more damage.

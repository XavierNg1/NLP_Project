 If possible, combine ingredients in a large Kitchen Aid mixer for a better blending result.


Combine until the mixture is fully integrated and almost a crumbly consistency.;
, Forgo the mixer for this step and instead use a rubber spatula to integrate the cream into the peanut butter, powdered sugar and cream cheese combination. Mix well until the whipped cream has become part of the mixture.
 Melting chips and milk can be done two ways––in the microwave or on the stove top. The stove is preferred.


Microwave chocolate chips and milk by placing them into a microwavable glass bowl. Set the microwave for 30 seconds and then stir the mixture. Return to the microwave for 30 more seconds, while watching the chocolate chips melt. Keep a careful eye on the microwave as you don’t want to burn the mixture. Stop microwaving when the majority of the chocolate chips have melted.
Place the milk and chocolate chips in a double boiler over medium to medium low heat. Stir the mixture constantly as it cooks and melts. Remove the mixture from the heat before every chip has melted. The residual heat from the milk will melt the rest of the chips.
 You may want to use individual bowls or dishes to create your parfaits.
 You want enough to create a “crust” along the bottom.
 The size of your bowl or dish will generally determine how much peanut butter mixture you add. Add enough so you can layer each of the ingredients two times.
 Add the mixture after it has cooled and is no longer extremely hot; this will stop it from tainting any of the other ingredients.
 This step is optional but can enhance the flavor of the chocolate and peanut butter combination.
 Create a thin layer of graham crackers.

 By saying these words, you are giving them access to your heart. Don't go saying it if you don't mean it. ONLY say it if you mean it or it WILL hurt their feelings.;
, Break the touch barrier and hug them straight out and cuddle with them. If they really love you, they will hug back. Just don't force them to do what they don't want to do.Â ;)

, By doing this, you will tell them that you are interested but not quite ready for the big boy/girl stuff yet. Don't start making out with him or her until you've really got down the pecking part but if he or she does first, don't back away which is telling them that you aren't interested. Slowly kiss back.
 You may do so by slowly moving towards them. Wrap your arms around him or her. Slowly open your mouth and explore his or her mouth. Don't worry if the kiss isn't 100% perfect. None are...it depends if you concentrate hard enough.
 If you are watching a horror movie, it's the perfect place but you can do this any time you wish. Just hold them close to you. Let your hips merge.
 It'll show that you appreciate them. Don't spend hundreds, but a simple card or a small gift would be nice.

 Take the left shoe lace of either shoe in your hand. Fold the lace over itself to create a loop. Leave a 3 to 4 inch tail on the end of the loop., Place the top of the loop between the thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand. With your dominant hand, hold the tail just below the base of the loop. Tightly twist the loop with your non-dominant hand.If needed, wrap the tail around the loop additional times.
 Continue to hold the top of the loop with your non-dominant hand. With your dominant hand, wrap the tail around the base of the loop 5 times., Grab the end of the lace with your dominant hand. Thread the end through the loop. As you pull the end tightly through the loop, use your non-dominant hand to push the knot towards the shoe., Tie barrel knots in the 3 remaining laces.
 If the laces are uneven, dragging on the floor, or just look too long, you may trim the laces. Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut off the excess from the leather laces.

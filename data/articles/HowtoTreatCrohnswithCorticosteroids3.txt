 One reason corticosteroids are not suggested for frequent use is because they can have negative side effects. For many people, the side effects are worse than the flare up symptoms, so they decide not to use corticosteroids. Side effects are connected to the dose and how long the treatment lasts. Some side effects include:High blood pressure
Puffy face
Night sweats
Higher risk of infection
Weight gain
Mood swings
Increased facial hair or acne
Cataracts
Psychosis
Elevated blood sugar levels
Osteoporosis
Insomnia

, Many doctors will prescribe alternate medication instead of corticosteroids. Even if you do take corticosteroids, there are ways you can limit the negative side effects.Your doctor may taper you off the steroids as soon as you need to so that you don’t get more steroids than needed.
Your doctor may suggest alternate-day dosing, where you take corticosteroids on every other day.
Corticosteroids taken rectally may produce less side effects or be safer.
Calcium supplements may help protect against osteoporosis.
 Corticosteroids are an older treatment option for acute Crohn’s flare ups. Many new treatments have been developed that can help treat the same symptoms. Because of this, there may be better treatment options available for you.Talk to your doctor about all treatments available. If you are prescribed steroids, discuss whether or not there is a better option for you.

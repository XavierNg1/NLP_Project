 The most important element to choosing your straightening tool is to find one that feels natural and makes straightening easier for you. However, a good rule of thumb is to select flat irons that are thinner for short hair and thicker for long hair. Before choosing a flat iron, consider the thickness or type of your hair. Thicker hair may require a wider flat iron to straighten a relatively small section, as this hair type makes it more difficult for heat to penetrate the layers of hair. If you have very dry hair, choose a lower heat setting to avoid frying hair., Flat irons can heat up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 Celsius) or higher. If your hair is thick or coarse, you’ll want to choose a high heat setting between 350 and 400 Fahrenheit (176 to 204 Celsius). If your hair is fine or damaged, use lower heat between 250 and 300 Fahrenheit (121 to 148 Celsius)., You can either blow dry or allow hair to air dry as you wish. Many people are under the mistaken assumption that blow drying damages hair. If you use a protectant spray, blow drying can actually make your hair healthier and easier to manage. This is largely due to the fact that blow drying prevents tangling that may occur when hair is allowed to air dry, and by brushing as you dry, the cuticles of hair are flattened making hair appear sleeker., Make sections on both sides of the head and down the back. Lift and separate the top layers of each section, and clip them to your head, leaving only the very bottom layer of hair free in each section., Starting with the bottom layer, select strands that are slightly thinner than your flat iron. You don’t want hair to get pulled or broken by attaching to other parts of the iron. Gently move the iron from the top of hair, as close to your head as possible, all the way to the tips of hair. Continue until each strand is straightened. Typically, you'll need to go over each strand at least three to four times, depending how curly your hair is.

 You can buy them from mail order companies, but it's best to purchase hand-picked corms to ensure they are of the highest quality.


Look for plump corms with thick centers for best the quality bloom. Avoid flat corms.
Base the size of the corms that you purchase on the size of the glads you want to grow. Choose corms with diameters of 1/2 to 3/4 inches (1.25 to 2 cm) to grow flowers from 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m). Corms with diameters of 1 inch (2.5 cm) or greater grow larger flowers.;
,, Glads prefer full sun but will tolerate partial shade.
, Gladiolus grown in soil without adequate drainage are more prone to disease.

Add organic compost, decomposed manure, ground bark or peat moss to the soil if drainage is a problem.






Raise the level of the gladiola garden 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) to elevate the plants from standing water if puddles still remain on the soil surface 4 to 5 hours after a heavy rain.
 Plant additional glads at 2-week intervals to extend their blooming season. Stop planting in mid-June to ensure the plants have ample flowering time.
,, Thoroughly water the entire area.

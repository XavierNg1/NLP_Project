 Most herbs do best in neutral soil that is neither too alkaline nor acidic. PH readings ranging from 6.5 to 7 are optimal.


Buy a soil pH testing kit.
Take a small soil sample from the area where you plan to plant your herb garden.
Open the pH testing kit and follow the included directions to find the pH of your soil.;
, This is a good idea even if you pH reading falls in the ideal range.


Use a shovel to dig down to 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm).
Continue to shovel and overturn the dirt, breaking up any large clumps to lighten the texture of the soil.
Search through the soil for any weeds. Remove any you find to prepare the soil for herbs.
Add your organic matter to the herb garden soil and mix well with your shovel or a hoe to make sure it becomes fully incorporated into the soil.



Wait until early spring or fall before adding lime to your soil as you want to allow the lime time to meld with the soil. Do not plant herbs shortly after adding lime.
Purchase lime or dolomite at a garden center or nursery.
Reference the application ratio on the lime package to see how much to add to your soil. You may want to opt for a lighter application of lime if you are unsure which ratio to use. Over-application of lime can be very difficult to correct.
Mix lime into soil and incorporate thoroughly.
 Most herbs will grow poorly in moist soil.

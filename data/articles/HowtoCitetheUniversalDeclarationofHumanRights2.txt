 Once again, you need to have a sentence that either paraphrases or directly quotes the UDHR in it. That is the only way you'll need an in-text citation for your sentence.


Use the same example form above: "As the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.'"

, Like APA style, you need an in-text citation in parenthesis. Unlike APA, the citation usually goes at the end of the sentence (the exception being if you cite two different sources in the same sentence). You'll need the author's name (again, the organization, the UN General Assembly). However, instead of the date, you'll use the article number that you're quoting from.For example, in this sentence, the citation would look this way: As the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights" (UN General Assembly art. 1).
 The MLA has recently updated their style guidelines, making them looser. In other words, the main point is to get the information in there, based on the nine basic elements of author, title of source (such as the book name), the title of container (such as a larger work or website the smaller work is contained in), additional contributors, version, number, publisher, publication date, and location. Obviously, not every source will have all of this information, so you just include as much as you can find.Therefore, the end reference will look like the following example: UN General Assembly. "Universal Declaration of Human Rights." United Nations, 217 (III) A, 1948, Paris, art. 1, http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/. Accessed 6 Sept. 2016.

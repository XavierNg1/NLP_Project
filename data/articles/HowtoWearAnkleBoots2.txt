 Black suede tends to be a good material to choose when picking out a boot with a high-heel but not a good choice in wet weather.


Stilettos elongate your legs and make you look taller. They also very sexy. However, they are more difficult to dance or walk in without practice.






If you're uncomfortable wearing stilettos or you're going on a date with a shorter person, consider boots with a smaller heel or wear flat boots.






For a formal "date night" look, go with a glossy, polished-looking boot.
 For a wintertime date, you can go all black or choose bold colors like red and royal blue for your dress. If the weather is warmer, choose lighter pastel colors and opt for a patterned dress that matches the climate you're in.


You can also opt to wear jeans or leggings, just make sure that the wash is dark and the pants fit tightly.
 You can tuck in a pretty blouse to your fitted jeans and add a skinny belt or simply leave your blouse untucked. Choose a style that is flattering to your body type.


Long-sleeved blouses with a front bow create a very sophisticated look.






Tank top V-neck blouses can be very sexy and look fabulous under a casual blazer for a fancy date.
 Make sure you shine on your date by adding some sparkle to your wardrobe. Incorporate dangly earrings and jewel-encrusted bangles to catch your date's eye.

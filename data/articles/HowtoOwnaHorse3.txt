 If you find that he's starting to put on excessive weight, try riding him more and feeding him less while still making sure he's getting enough nutrients. If it's spring he's gaining weight because of the new grass coming through, consider keeping him stabled for a week or so. However if you do this you'll have to ride/lung him ideally once or twice every day. He's still got energy and needs to burn it, plus this will help him lose weight. On the other hand, if he's losing a considerable amount of weight, review how much you're feeding him and add more. If it's already a large amount, your horse could have a health problem, so get the vet out as soon as possible.
 Have fun with your new horse and always remember this golden tip: 'There's no such thing as a bad horse, just a bad rider.' Horses are living creatures just like us. They have the potential to seriously injure or even kill you, but will trust you and love you if you trust and love them back. So never be cruel or mistreat your horse!

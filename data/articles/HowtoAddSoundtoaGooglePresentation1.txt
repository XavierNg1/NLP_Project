 Do this by opening this link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/.;
, You can do this by clicking the plus icon on the bottom righthand corner of the web page. A new, blank slide will open.


If you already have an existing file you want to add music to, just select it from the list of presentations displayed to open it.
 The first way you can add music to your presentations is with the help of links. Open a new browser tab and go to any music or video streaming sites where the media file you want to use is located.


Popular music or video streaming sites are YouTube, SoundCloud, and Spotify.
 Open the music or video you want to add and copy its URL from the address bar of your web browser, by right-clicking it and selecting “Copy.”


You don’t have to finish streaming the music or video, all you need is its link.
 Go back to Google Presentation and select the Text button on the menu toolbar at the upper portion of the window. Click anywhere on the presentation slide and a text field will appear.
 Paste the link you copied on the text field to add it to your slide. Select the arrow button from the menu bar, and using your mouse cursor, move the text field anywhere on the slide where you want to place the link.
 Click “View” from the menu toolbar and select “Present” from the drop down list to play the presentation. While the presentation is in view, click the link you’ve pasted to open and play the video or file on a separate browser tab.

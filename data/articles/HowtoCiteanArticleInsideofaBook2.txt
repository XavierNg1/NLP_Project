 With APA, you begin with the author’s last name again, but you follow it with just the author’s first and/or middle initial(s). After this, add the year of publication. This is demonstrated in the following example:


“Whistler, G. (2003).”

, Don’t put the name of the essay in quotations. Also, use sentence-case capitalization; this means that you only capitalize the first word in the title. For example: “Whistler, G. (2003). How to store books.”

, After you list the names of the editor, write: “(Eds.)”. For example:


“Whistler, G. (2003). How to store books. In Jess Jones and Joe Davis (Eds.),”

, Use title-case capitalization, meaning you capitalize the first and last words and other important words. For example:


“Whistler, G. (2003). How to store books. In Jess Jones and Joe Davis (Eds.), The Books We Love”

, These are the pages that the essay or article spans within the book. For example:


“Whistler, G. (2003). How to store books. In Jess Jones and Joe Davis (Eds.), The Books We Love (54-72).”

, Follow this information with a period to complete the citation:


“Whistler, G. (2003). How to store books. In Jess Jones and Joe Davis (Eds.), The Books We Love (54-72). Eugene: Ocean Books.”

, For an in-text citation, use a parenthesis, the author’s last name, a comma, the date, a comma, and the page number:


“Books should be stored in a dry room (Whistler, 2003, p. 56).”

 This is a perforated device that sits above the water in a saucepan but under the lid. You place your vegetables or meat in it, in order to allow them to steam evenly.
 Meanwhile, heat approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) of water in your saucepan until they come to a boil. Make sure you choose a pan in which the steaming basket fits comfortably.
 Place your vegetables inside, and cover the saucepan with a lid. Steam for approximately 5 to 10 minutes, depending upon the vegetables.


The food should take on a bright color, when it is properly steamed. Place herbs, spices or lemon juice in the water to flavor the vegetables as you steam them.
 Although this is often not seen as the most flavorful way to cook meat, it is 1 of the healthiest methods. Fish can take 5 to 10 minutes, while a chicken breast usually takes 10 to 15 minutes.

 Many communities have LGBT events year round, from community gatherings to local Gay Pride Festivals. Look for your communityâ€™s Pride website or LGBT organization website to find events celebrating the LGBT community.


For example, the DC Center for the LGBT Community offers monthly events connecting people, such as coffee meetings and clubs., There may be clubs for LGBT people in your community. You can find them at local universities, community centers, even churches. Look online at your local university to see if their LGBT clubs are open to community members. Ask any LGBT friends you have if they attend clubs in your area that you can join.


Such groups can be both social and activist in nature. For example, many LBGT clubs on college campuses offer a place for people of the same sexual orientation to interact. Yet these groups sometimes also advocate for equality on their campuses.
You might be able to find organizations like these on-campus ones in the community at community centers, bars, or other local hot spots.
 You may be able to find other bisexual people at gay bars. You may also be able to find bisexual people at gatherings for the LGBT community at local churches. You increase your odds of meeting other bisexual people by going where you think others might go.

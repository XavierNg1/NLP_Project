 Let the vet know you are coming so they can be prepared to take care of the dog as soon as you arrive. Also, let them know if you will need help getting the dog inside to prevent any further injuries., Tell the vet everything you can about the condition of the dog. For instance, relay any measures you have already taken, like splinting a bone injury or applying a tourniquet. In addition, give them a general assessment of the dog’s vital signs. Is it breathing on its own? Is its body cool to the touch? Does the dog appear to be unconscious? The more information you can give the vet before you get there, the better they will be able to take care of the dog., You will, no doubt, want to get to the vet’s office as quickly as possible, but you should be careful to drive cautiously so you do not end up in a second accident. Observe all traffic laws and stay calm while you are driving.

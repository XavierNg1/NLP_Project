 Everyone has a different opinion for what is acceptable for video games. Decide on an acceptable time for each day or for the week. Some parents limit video games to one hour per day, while others completely ban video games during the school week and only allow for a few hours on the weekends.Many healthcare professionals and development specialists recommend that children should not spend more than two hours each day in front of a television or computer screen. Take this into account when determining what time limits you want to set and decide on an acceptable amount of video game playing time that works for you.
 Some kids develop an actual addiction to playing video games. They experience behavioral, emotional, and physical symptoms, such as becoming withdrawn from family and friends. It is important for parents to understand what the signs and symptoms are, so that they can recognize them if they develop in their child.For example, your child may be unable to stop playing, get aggressive or upset when they are not playing, or lose interest in all other activities. They may irritable or depressed when not playing video games. Children may neglect their personal hygiene, have disrupted sleep, and experience back or wrist pain.
 If you believe your child is addicted to video games and you’ve tried to limit their behavior with no change, you may need help from a professional. Your child’s doctor or a mental health professional can work with you and your child to help positively change their behavior and enforce limits.This may be a good option if your child reacts violently to limits on their video game access. If your child is destructive, aggressive, or threatening due to you trying to change their behavior, they may need to see a mental health professional.

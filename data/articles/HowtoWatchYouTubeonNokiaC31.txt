 To begin, select the stock Nokia web browser or the Opera mobile browser on your C3 phone from the list of applications. Open either browser. For the stock browser, you can do this by selecting Menu > Internet from the home screen.


The browser you choose shouldn't affect your experience. You may even be able to reach the YouTube site on a different browser you've downloaded (like, for instance, the UC Browser.)However, if you experience problems with one, you may want to try the other. If neither works, try one of the alternative app solutions listed in the section below.;
, In the browser’s address bar, type in m.youtube.com. This should take you to the YouTube mobile site, which is optimized for the mobile viewing experience.


If you cannot reach m.youtube.com, you may have a problem with your phone's wi-fi settings. Try using a computer to browse the official support pages for the C3-00 and C3-01 for additional help., Select the search bar of the mobile YouTube page, then use the C3's keyboard to type in the title of a video you want to watch or enter keywords for videos you’re interested in viewing. For example, if you want to watch music videos, type in "music videos". Click the phone's "enter" button or select the search button in the browser window to continue.
 You should now see a list of videos that match your search terms. Select a video from a list of search results. Click the title of the video and the video should begin to load. Enjoy your video!


It bears mentioning that you may want to keep your expectations for your video-viewing experience in check — though C3 series phones can play a variety of video formats, they only have a 320 × 240 pixel display and a limited amount of internal memory — thus, video quality and loading speeds are unlikely to be as good as they are on newer mobile devices.

 As you send her those signals, see what she does. If she blushes or smiles, you're on the right track.


If she seems confused, don't fret. You may just be going too fast. Jog back a bit and take it slow.
If she's not reciprocating, it's not the right moment. Be patient. It may have nothing to do with you.
 If you're in the middle of an action movie and she's so entranced the popcorn is missing her mouth, it's not the right time. Use your own senses of whether or not to get close and personal.


If it's not happening, create it. Walk her to her door, take her somewhere new, or learn to play her favorite song.
 Look at her eyes and lips. Getting impatient or distracted (or, God forbid, focusing on other parts of her body) may scare her away.


Focusing will make her easier to read. Knowing if a girl wants to kiss is half the battle.
 If she senses you're even the slightest bit unhappy, she may be not want to take the risk. Remember: she's reading you, too!


Smiling will put both of you in a better mood. It's contagious and tricks the mind.
 The moment is good whether she kisses you or not. Even if she doesn't now, you're putting in time for later.


It's easy to sense when someone is nervous. Your heart will race and you'll perspire. Remember to breathe.

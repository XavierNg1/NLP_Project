 Place two granny squares on top of each other with the right sides facing together.


This method is quick and easy, and as long as you keep the stitches fairly loose, it makes the seam very flexible and soft.
 Thread a large darning needle with yarn. Insert one end of the yarn through the eye of the needle and pull enough of it through to prevent the needle from becoming un-threaded during the joining process.


You do not need to knot the yarn, but you may do so if you have difficulty keeping the yarn on the needle. Knot the short end of the yarn to the opposite side of the yarn, just past the portion which passes through the eye of the needle.
 Pull the thread through the the back loop in both the top and bottom squares.


Do not pull the yarn all the way through since there is no knot on the end of the yarn to hold it in place.
Leave enough yarn at the end after pulling the rest through to either knot or use in attaching another square, depending on whether this square is on the end of a row or in the middle, respectively.
 Bring the needle over the edge of both squares and into the next back loop of the top square. Push it through the loops of both the top and back squares once more.


Repeat this with the next set of back loops. You are essentially sewing the squares together using a whip stitch, or a type of stitch that stitches over the edge of the material rather than before the edge.
Continue sewing this top edge of the two squares together to connect them together.
 After the two squares have been joined together, you can use the same technique to join squares to the other sides of the same two squares. Expand your squares out in whichever direction you need to in order to add rows in both directions.


Knot the yarn to the back edge of the final square once you have finished stitching them together.

 They will learn to expect this if they act good, and will likely want the attention, and this will make them more compelled to follow directions.
 If your children act good for a week, give them a treat to reward them for their hard work. After a month, maybe buy them a toy they've wanted, and so on. Beware; only do this until you feel they are ready to continue without physical encouragement. After all, every time you behave well, you don't get a treat!

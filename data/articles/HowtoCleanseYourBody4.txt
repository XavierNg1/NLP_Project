Tobacco in all its forms, including cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, and chewing tobacco. Smoking marijuana is also harmful to the lungs and may contain chemicals that are toxic to the body.
Other drugs like cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine (crystal meth) are addictive and highly destructive to the body., Harmful chemicals found in plastics and other substances are tied to cancer and other diseases. It's difficult to live completely free of chemicals, since they're present in our food, clothing, furniture, air and water. Do your best to live a chemical-free life by taking the following measures:


Eat organic food. Ingesting pesticides that are sprayed on produce can be harmful to your health. Choose organic produce and organic, hormone-free meat and eggs.
Research the fish you eat to make sure it doesn't contain high levels of mercury and other heavy metals.
Choose natural fabrics like cotton and silk instead of wearing polyester. When possible, wear organic clothing and use organic linens and towels.
Use soap, shampoo, conditioner, and makeup made with natural substances instead of chemicals.
Use natural solutions, like vinegar and water, to clean your house, rather than relying on chemicals like bleach and other commercial cleaning agents.
 Stress is as physically damaging as it is emotionally damaging. It causes a rise in blood pressure and the production of hormones that lead to weight gain. Limit stress by eliminating unnecessary activities from your schedule.


Getting plenty of sleep helps relieve stress. Make sure you get at least 7 or 8 hours a night.
If your stress seems unmanageable, consider seeing a therapist for help. A therapist will be able to teach you effective stress management techniques.

 Select a dye that's a lighter shade than your natural color without being radically different, such as a dark brunette shade. Black hair has a lot of red and copper undertones. If you want an auburn hair color, select a reddish brown. This will bring out your natural coppery undertones to create your desired look., If you do not want an auburn shade, pick a color cooler than your natural hair tone. This will lighten your hair without giving it a coppery look., Before you begin the dyeing process, it's important to make sure you're safe. Dye can sting skin and stain clothing. Put on a pair of gloves and cover your shoulders with a towel to prevent stains., Use your tinting bowl and brush, which should have come in your hair dye kit, to mix your dye and developer into a smooth, even mixture. In most cases, dye is mixed with developer in a one to one ratio, but read your instructions first. The precise ratio varies by the manufacturer., Part your hair down the middle of your head, making a part running from your forehead to the nape of your neck. On either side of this part, use hair ties or hair clips to section your hair into four even sections., Apply dye starting with a section at the back of your head and then move forward. Working from the top of the section, use the brush that came with your kit to brush dye onto your hair in tiny, thin sections. Keep adding dye to sections until the section is completely covered in dye. Then, move on to the next section., Usually, your dye should sit on for 45 minutes. However, this depends on the brand of dye, so refer to your package instructions. Let your dye sit in your hair for the required amount of time., Use your fingers to gently work the dye out of your hair while in the shower using lukewarm water. Make sure you get all the dye out. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. When you're done, you'll be left with a stunning dye job to enjoy.

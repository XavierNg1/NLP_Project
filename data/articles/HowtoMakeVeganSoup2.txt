 Pureeing some of the black beans while leaving others whole gives this soup a creamy yet hearty texture. You can use either dried beans or canned beans, depending on your preference.
 Roasted carrots and then fennel, with its licorice-like taste, are pureed to make this smooth and flavorful soup. Fennel is a perennial plant that grows year-round, making it one of the few vegetables actually in season during wintertime.
 Pureed shallots, potatoes, red onion and jalapeno are combined with a mix of both pureed and chopped broccoli. Vegan cheese, soy creamer and soy milk give the soup a thick and creamy base without the addition of dairy.

 You can't be a fan-girl on Tumblr unless you have one. Make an account.;
, If you want to be a hardcore fan-girl on here, maybe you only follow blogs about what you are interested in. For example, if you want a blog about Scrubs the television show, maybe you only follow other Scrubs blogs so you can reblog their posts and still have them make sense on your blog.
 If there is one thing that upsets fan-girls, it's a blog that doesn't follow what it says it will. So if you say you have blog about only cats, have a blog about only cats. Don't turn your back on something and not change the blog title, that might be confusing for some.
 You should get followers from the same fandom for your blog.
 On Tumblr, you can tag all of your posts with things like #adorable or #dogs or anything that suits what you are talking about. You will get more followers if you tag what you are posting.

 The ends of the grapefruit with the small circles on them should be across from each other, on either side of the grapefruit. Make sure to place it on a cutting board.
 Imagine that the "poles" of the grapefruit are on either side, like a globe turned on its side. Now, slice the grapefruit on its equator, creating lines that are parallel to the small circular "poles" on each end of the fruit. Cut each slice so its about 1/4 inch (.6 cm)









When you're done, you should have about a dozen circular slices, depending on the size of the grapefruit.
 If you'd like to cut the grapefruit further, you can cut each round slice into halves or fourths, like you were cutting off pieces of a pie. This method can be ideal for using the grapefruit in fruity drinks. You can also just cut one slice into the middle of the grapefruit and use it as a garnish on the side of a bowl of fruit salad or on a large pitcher of grapefruit juice. Or you can just rip the slice apart and eat it right from the slice without using a spoon or fork.

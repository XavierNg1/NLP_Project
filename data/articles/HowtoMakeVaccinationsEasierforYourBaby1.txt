Babies as young as 6 months old can recognize a familiar face over time. If your baby feels like he/she knows everyone in the doctor’s office, it will be a less scary place for him/her.
Get to know the nurses and the front desk staff so that when you take your baby to the doctor’s office, most of the people will know his/her name and can greet him/her accordingly. This will ease a lot of your baby’s tension because he/she will feel like everyone at the office is a friend and not a stranger to be scared of.;
, If you arrive too early for your baby’s appointment, you may be waiting for a while. Waiting for anything increases anxiety because it gives your older baby more time to think about what is about to occur. Your baby may become more and more anxious about his/her appointment and vaccination if you arrive too early and have to sit in the waiting room for a long time. Small babies may get overstimulated if they wait too long, leading to crankiness and tiredness.
 Don’t change doctors too often. If your baby sees the same doctor from the time he/she is born, he/she will develop a relationship with that doctor. This one step can do wonders for decreasing fear and anxiety in babies regarding vaccines and any other medical procedure. The doctor will not only know your baby well, but your baby will know the doctor well. This will make your baby feel more comfortable because the doctor will not be a stranger.
 It can be a lot easier to get a vaccination if you take your baby to the doctor with your spouse present. This way, one of you can distract your baby while the other one can focus on keeping your baby in place while holding his/her arm steady for the shot. Although some babies may not respond well to this technique, many times it can help make your baby feel a lot calmer and more comfortable.

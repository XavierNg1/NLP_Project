 Instead of cutting the grapefruit around the center, cut the grapefruit top to bottom at each navel, or pole. This should give you two equal sized grapefruit halves., Lay each grapefruit half flat side down on a cutting board. Take a sharp knife and cut away the skin. You can also try peeling the skin with your fingernails, but a knife may work better to also get off the white layer of membrane inside the skin. , Take the serrated knife and cut each section of fruit away from the membrane. Cut as closely as you can to the membrane, so you are not leaving any fruit behind on the membrane. When you are done, the fruit should be separated into wedges, and membrane should be left behind. , The fruit of the grapefruit is fragile when separated from the skin and membrane, so be careful as you move the wedges to a plate. Sprinkle with sugar if you like. Eat either using your fingers or spear with a toothpick.

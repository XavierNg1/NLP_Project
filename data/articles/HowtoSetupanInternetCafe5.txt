 Your café's Internet connection will most likely need a higher grade, more robust connection than a normal household set up. Negotiate with the ISP as they may offer special deals for businesses, especially Internet cafés. (You also might want to determine if you need a "static IP" address for Local Area Network (LAN) services and or programs.)


A static IP address is for one customer only. A dynamic IP address will provide a different IP address each time you log on to your computer. Having a dynamic IP address means that you are sharing an IP address with several other customers., If possible, use a professional designer. Work with the designer so that they understand the special requirements of an Internet café such as keeping food and beverage preparation and consumption from damaging computer equipment. Include an electrician in the design process to ensure that the infrastructure will be able to handle the load of all the electronic devices in your café.
 Following your business plan, purchase computers, network cable, routers, printers, crimping tools and RJ-45 jacks. If you are including amenities also purchase any food and beverage preparation items such as plates, cups, and microwave ovens.
 This includes all the construction and renovations, electrical work, network setup, computer and software installation, and a security system. Add any other specialty services such as an area for food and drink preparation.
 Use free software alternatives such as Linux as an alternative to Microsoft Windows or the Mac OS and the OpenOffice.org suite as an alternative to the Microsoft Office suite. Consider using live CDs without hard disk drives (dumb terminals) in the computers to reduce maintenance.


Install a firewall on your router if it does not already have one to protect your network from worms, viruses and other outside attacks.
Find a software solution that will protect your computers from viruses such as virus protection software or live CDs.

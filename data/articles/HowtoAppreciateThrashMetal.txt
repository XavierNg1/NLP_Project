 You will find that there are many different bands around the world, each with different styles. Many thrash metal bands have influenced other metal sub-genres.;
, These four bands were among the pioneers of thrash metal and many bands spawned after. Start with less intense bands like Anthrax and Metallica. If your ears are not used to louder sounds, don't start with a band like Kreator or Sodom. Thrash metal songs usually use fast guitar riffs with shredding-style guitar solos.
 The stereotype about thrash metal fans being aggressive and violent is not true. Remember that it's all about the music and you don't have to grow long hair and change the way you look.
 You'll realize the guitar riffs are fast and difficult to play and compose. Bass and drum playing is also difficult, due to the genre's high speed. In fact some Thrash Metal drummers like Dave Lombardo (Slayer) and Charlie Benante (Anthrax) are regarded as some of the best drummers in heavy metal.
 Even if it's on a TV screen, observe how the group members manipulate the instruments. If you've ever tried to play those instruments yourself, you'll probably be amazed with how skillfully they play. It takes practice, and dedication, which challenges the stereotype of metalheads being lazy and careless. You might also be surprised about how energetic some of the performers are.
 That includes the riffs, drums, solos, and lyrics. Writing your own music demonstrates another dimension of instrumental mastery and talent, as well as making the music more personal and less manufactured.
 Thrash metal lyrics and themes demonstrate rebellion and anger. Topics such as politics, war, and violence are common in thrash metal. The fact that thrash metal musicians aren’t afraid to talk about anything from ANY point of view in their music lyrics is probably the main reason that many people avoid thrash metal. And NOTE: Few Thrash Metal bands have Satanic/Anti-Christian lyrics, and if you’re seriously against that kind of stuff, Slayer are bands to avoid. Although some bands use satanic lyrics in songs, most are not actually Satanists including Slayer. And use this rule for the lyrics: The more over-the-top the lyrics are, the less seriously you should take them.
 Thrash vocals are usually very aggressive and sometimes angry sounding, but they are still understandable.
 Many thrash metal bands use death metal, black metal, and hardcore in their music. Thrash metal with even more hardcore elements than standard thrash is called crossover thrash or crossover for short. Its overall sound is more hardcore-influenced than traditional thrash metal, while more melodic than traditional hardcore and thrashcore. Crossover is often more aggressive and simpler than traditional thrash metal due to the heavier hardcore influence. There is even a resurgence of thrash bands! Some Thrash band have even re-recorded old material, you may find it more to your liking, since they have better production value(i.e. First Strike Still Deadly - Testament / Let There Be Blood - Exodus).

 Remove the orange part of the peel only by carving it away with a chef’s knife. You may find it easiest to peel in large, long pieces. Avoid picking up the white pith as much as possible.The white pith is bitter, thus you want to cut as much of the orange part only as you can.
 Use a large chopping knife, such as a Santoku knife. Cut the peel into long, thin strips. Lay parchment paper over the baking sheet before placing the peel down in a single layer., Warm your oven to a low setting, between 100 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (38 to 93 degrees Celsius).Keep the oven door cracked open, and check the peels frequently. Cook the peels until they stiffen and begin to curl.


The peels can change from dry to burnt quickly, thus you need to keep a close eye on them.
This process can take anywhere from twenty minutes to forty minutes or more.
Alternately, you can dry the peels in a food dehydrator.
 Remove the tray from the oven and allow it to cool. Cut the peels down to small pieces that resemble loose-leaf tea.


An exact size is not necessary; the peels may be finely or coarsely chopped.
 Boil water until it reaches 212°F (100°C).Fill an empty tea bag or sachet with the dried, chopped peel. Steep the bag of sour orange in a cup of hot water for six to seven minutes.Three cups of day daily, using one to two grams of dried peel, may soothe indigestion and heartburn by regulating stomach acidity.

 Do not use any type of abrasive cleanser, such as Clorox or something with grit, as this will damage the surface of your board and it will stain permanently.








Wipe away the permanent ink with the wet cloth.
Wipe the board with a wet cloth to remove any remnants of the solvent, otherwise it may interfere with the dry erase marker when you try to write on the board.
Dry the board completely before use.
 Only try this if the other methods don't work, as scrubbing the board with the eraser could potentially damage the surface.

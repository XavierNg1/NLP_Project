 Only a vet can make the best decision for you and your cat. If there is no blockage your veterinarian will most likely suggest sending a sample of urine for culture to see if infection is present, and what antibiotic the bugs are sensitive to. If infection is confirmed then a course of antibiotics will be prescribed.Urinary tract infections should subside after seven days., The vet may order a cystocentesis. This is where a veterinarian will place a needle through your cat's abdomen to remove urine from her bladder. While it does not hurt your cat, many cats dislike being held on her back.Additionally, your vet may order blood tests, urinalysis, and possibly a urine culture to determine the nature of your cat's inflammation.This can help determine which drugs, if any, your vet should prescribe.The veterinarian may also order a X-ray or ultrasound. This is to investigate the cause of the bladder discomfort so that treatment can be targeted at that problem. The clinician needs to rule out issues such as blockages, bladder, stones or bladder polyps, before bumping the diagnosis of bladder infection higher up the list., Medication can only be prescribed by a veterinarian. The vet may choose to give your cat antibiotics to clear up any infection. Your cat will probably need a follow-up urine test seven days after she has finished taking antibiotic.The vet may also give your cat pain medication.

 The tehta is read before the tengwa. Therefore, vowels are placed on the letter AFTER them.
 If you have an r followed by a vowel, use the left tengwa. If you have an r followed by a consonant or at the end of a word, use the right tengwa.
 The above table shows the values for this mode.
 Often the second tengwa is used instead.
The third tengwa represents gh as in aghast and ghost. For gh as in bought, use the fourth tengwa.
The fifth tengwa represents ny as in canyon, not as in pony.
The sixth tengwa is usually used for a consonantal y, with the seventh being used as a vowel y.
The eighth tengwa usually only appears in combinations such as ea in Earth.

 It's a waste of time if you try learning TBF whilst you can barely BF, take step for step and do not rush it. Learning TBF takes time and patience. Mastering TBF will take even more time than you'd ever think of!;
, To change options/settings press the following keys Escape > Options > Keyboard > Defense click on defense and press right click. It should say something like: Right Button, Right Click etc. This is what it should somewhat look like once you're done with your setting up your Options!

, Anything less or more than 250 is not good for you if you're going to learn TBF and use it while fighting etc. To find the FPS limiter do the following: Escape > Options > 1337 > Maximum Frames Per Seconds (FPS) and type in 250 in the small dialog box.
 To learn TBF you'll have to spend a lot of time slashing walls, believe it or not! For starters let's find some TBF Training spots! We can start by training your first slash so it gets lower and gets more space for the second and third slash later on!

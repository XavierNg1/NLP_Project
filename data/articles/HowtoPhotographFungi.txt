 Most fungi are fairly seasonal. You need to know when and where. The best times are usually the fall and the spring.;
, Unlike flowers, who aim for the sun, fungi are usually where it is dank and dark. Quite often not in the nicest spots. Think under trees, usually rotting, in, or near, compost, in, or near, animal refuse, etc.
 Quite often, because of the nature of the beast, the fungi are not 'photo ready'. They could be partially covered with dirt and leaves.
 You will need to get down for most of the fungi and mushrooms you find. You will want to shoot at their level, or even below it.
 Be sure you have some type of macro lens so that you can come in nice and close.
 There are a few ways that you could do it. They are:


Use the flash to create a fill flash effect on the mushrooms.






Use an off camera flash or lighting. This will allow you to change the angle of the lighting more than an onboard flash will.






Use reflectors. Reflectors will use the available light and give you a more natural shot.
 You could use a beanbag, a mini tripod, or even set it on the ground (carefully).
 Mushrooms grow pretty slowly and don't move a lot, so you shouldn't have to worry too much about it moving.

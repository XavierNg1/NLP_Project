 The blogging platforms will offer you fonts and website looks. Some of the sample websites like on Wordpress, have their own names and pictures, etc. Don't use the names they already have on the sample website you choose, but use your real title and take away all the photos and paragraphs that are part of the sample website. Add your own.
 Make a good blog post title, it's your first blog post so make it look attractive! Write from your heart, write what you know about and what Â you want to say. Blogging is all about being able to write your opinion on something, but don't be too harsh or too boring.


An article such as "How to Cook Popcorn" is probably what people aren't looking for. They want something unique, new, and interesting to them.

 A hesh or rasta skater is someone who generally acts like they don't care about anything. Hash skaters tend to have a grungier, dirtier look and will wear clothes that don't always look super clean. This is because they want to achieve the look that they haven't tried and don't care that other people notice.
 Often times hash skaters achieve their dirty, grungy looks by having a beard or facial hair that looks unkept. Grow out your facial hair, and you can even consider getting dreadlocks or growing out the hair on your head. Whatever you do, don't try too hard because then you've gone against what a hash skater is., Instead of looking like a normal skater with tight jeans and a snapback, try some canvas pants and a beanie. In your style you'll want to bring in some red, yellow, and green as these are popular colors in rasta.

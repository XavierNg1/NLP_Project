 Many big stores, especially toy stores, let you create an account on their website where you can make a wish list filled with things you want for Christmas. You can give the link to your wish list to friends and family so they can go online to find out what you want. There are also many apps that allow you to create a wish list on your phone and share it with friends and family through text, email or social media., You can type what you want for Christmas in a fun holiday email and send it to friends and family. Collect all of the email addresses and send the list to as many people as you want. You can send it as a group email, or to be more personal you can send the emails individually with a personalized note in each one.


Make the email have a theme of gratitude to show your friends and family that youâ€™re thankful to have them all in your life and not just asking for presents.
 Write your Christmas list down on paper and hang it up in your house. Hang it somewhere that your family will see and read it. You can also mail a letter to friends and family that has your list on it. Make sure you mail it early enough for your friends and family to get it before Christmas.

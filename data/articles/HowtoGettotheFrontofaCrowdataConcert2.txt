 Enjoy them, perhaps have a drink, etc. Wait for your favourite act to come on. Don't try to get to the front now, or you never will.
 Run as fast as you can, jumping about to get to the front. Give all your energy, jump, sing, and dance. Give 10 times the energy of everyone around you. There's a psychological trick going on here. When you make people believe that you want to be there more than they do, they will just let you pass them. If you're getting in late and they're already performing, just follow this tip as soon as you get in, but it may not be as effective.
 After following the above tip, you should be as far as you can get (which should be just a few rows from the front). This is a hard place to be. Embrace the pushing and shoving, the natural movement of the crowd, and use it to your advantage. Slip through the cracks to get closer. Know your limits though, accept water from the bouncers when it comes. If you're lucky, you'll find your way to the very front.

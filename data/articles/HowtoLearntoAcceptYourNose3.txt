 Many people become self-conscious about their noses only when someone teases them about it. The best strategy is to ignore the teasing, as the teaser is just trying to get a rise out of you. Follow these steps to ignore teasing:Play it cool: Don’t show any reaction to the teasing. Keep your facial expression neutral and don’t let your body show aggression.
Zip your lip: Don’t respond with any verbal response, especially an aggressive response.
Walk away: Leave the situation. This might be either physically leaving, by walking out the door, or mentally leaving, by turning away and engaging in another activity.
 Worrying about how your nose looks takes up valuable brain power. People will like you regardless of your nose if you listen to them.One way to ensure that someone’s attention is not on your nose is to turn the conversation onto him or her. Everybody is proud of something, such as his occupation, family, church or beliefs. If you are worried that this person will notice your nose, listen closely to discover what someone is proud of.. Once you have identified a point of pride, compliment the person about that. If possible, extend it into a related friendly joke.Focusing on other people can be challenging. Practicing this will take your focus away from your nose in social situations, make you feel more positive, and be more likeable to others.

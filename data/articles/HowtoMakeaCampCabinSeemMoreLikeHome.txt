 Many people feel more secure on the bottom bunk, but top bunks offer a unique loft feeling. If you are even the least bit claustrophobic, it is a good idea to choose the top bunk.;
, Set up your belongings around your bunk, but be careful not to place your things in anyone else's area. Take advantage of the unique architecture of your cabin, hanging things from parts of the bed, or lining items up along a windowsill. It is also advisable to keep a flashlight within easy reach, as no one has fun walking around in the dark.
 Hang up posters, pictures from home, and magazine clippings. If you have some extra time, use whatever you've brought with you to make your own decorations. You may also want to tape up letters from home.
 If you don't have one, make one with boxes, pieces of wood/large sticks/logs. It doesn't have to be a "real" bookshelf, just two or more heavy objects holding the books up. if you can build one with a top, place the next day's clothes, your makeup, extra flashlight batteries, etc. on top, so you can get to them easily.
 it's a great way to bond, and, it will make everyone feel a little more at home. You can even decorate using a theme!

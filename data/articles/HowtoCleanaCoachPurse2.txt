 Here's how to clean your purse without taking an extra trip to the coach store:


Find the soiled area.
Gently dab the area without scrubbing it. This will keep the texture of the purse intact.
Remove excess cleaner by wiping it away gently with a clean, dampened cloth.
Blot the fabric dry with a third clean, white cloth and allow the fabric to dry completely.
If you're trying to remove a grease stain and it does not come out with soap and water, add a drop or two of dish detergent.
 Once you've dabbed the stain as well as you could, it's time to let the purse rest.


Give it at least one hour depending on how wet it is.
Don't use it if the fabric is still wet because this can do further damage.
 Now that you've cleaned your purse, it's important to keep it clean in the future. Here's what to do:


Keep a package of baby wipes or a small piece of cloth in your purse.
When you notice a new stain, apply the wipes to the stain, or moisten the piece of cloth and do the same.

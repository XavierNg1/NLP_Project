 If he or she only talks about your appearance or your sex life, that points to it being primarily a case of sexual attraction. Even if you might feel love, you have to consider the other person’s feelings and ideas about the connection you share. Discussions like these can be uncomfortable, but they can also help clarify how you both feel.

"I really like hanging out with you and I hope you like hanging out with me. What do you have the most fun doing together?"
"I don’t want a big serious conversation, but I wanted to know if you like keeping things the way they are between us or if ultimately you might be looking for more."
"I know we haven’t defined things, and that’s fine, but I wanted to know how you see our relationship."

, Even though lust can turn to romantic love, it’s often just about sexual attraction and will not develop into anything further. As much as you might want one kind of relationship with the other person, if they do not reciprocate you can’t have the connection you want.
 Sometimes both sides need time to think about what they really want. If you have two different ideas about where the relationship is headed, you might not be able to reach a shared understanding of what you have. If you can reach a shared vision about where you’re going, that’s great. But it’s often difficult, if not impossible, if you and the other person are far apart in terms of what you hope to get out of the relationship. At that point, you would probably want to break it off.

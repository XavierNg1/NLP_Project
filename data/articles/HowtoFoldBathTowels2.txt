 Stretch the towel out on a solid surface, such as a table. Stand facing the long edge of the towel., Grasp both corners of the long end towel and fold it over to the halfway mark on the short edge of the towel. This will create a crease down the length of the towel., Grasp the opposite corners of the towel and fold them to the halfway mark as well. The corners of the towel should now meet in the middle of the top and bottom of the towel. This will create parallel creases down the length of the towel., The previous two steps have created two long creases down the length of the towel. Fold the towel in half by folding the length of the towel on top of itself, creating four layers. The towel should now be long and skinny., Leave a little bit of a gap in the center to avoid bulging in the center., Place one hand in the center of the towel and use the other hand to fold the towel in half. Rotate the towel so that the folded edge is on display.

 When choosing the tile line, make sure you choose a basic pattern with natural colors. You can choose various blues, deep beige tones, and grays. Reds, whites, and terracotta colors stick out. It is not necessarily a good thing is because a vinyl liner is mirroring real tile. The more obvious it is, the more fake it looks.;
, Another good trick is to eliminate the tile line and have the texture pattern of the liner come all the way to the top. This is a seamless and natural look.
 The pattern you select will be responsible for the shimmer and color of the water. Deeper blues or colors similar to a lagoon represent the best. They give the water a blue or green shade and create contrast between that and the decking.
 From most liner choices, you should choose the darkest pattern possible and enjoy the free thermal heating. In areas where pool water gets too hot then a very light color liner would be best.
 Color fading is one of the only things not covered by a liner warranty. If you choose a dark pattern liner, be sure it is printed on blue stock, and light colored liners should be printed on white stock. This way if the pattern fades off these areas will blend in with the rest of the liner instead of standing out.

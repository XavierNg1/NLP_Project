 As it is our aim is to get the best from our plants (so we can ultimately enjoy the maximum yield in fruit the plant can give) it is recommended that you use an organic mulch. Why? Your soil will benefit more from an organic mulch than an inorganic one. Organic mulch will (apart from providing a secure cover, help with hydration and stop weed growth) also assist in feeding the soil and in keeping away soil-borne diseases. Examples of organic mulch are: manure, leaf mould, mushroom compost, etc.;
, Spring is the start of your gardening year. The decomposition process in your compost heap picks up as a result of the increased temperatures. Starting to mulch at this time is great because if you also are planning to commence planting in spring you need to ensure your bedding soil is well insulated should there be any sudden turns in the weather (as is not uncommon during spring). Mulching will provide this insulation.
 Remove any weeds and ensure you get the roots out as well so they don't grow back into your mulch later on. Make sure that any mulch left over from the previous season is worked into the soil. Also, you need to ensure the soil is properly hydrated before you can commence adding your new spring mulch.
 Cover the soil with approximately 8 centimeter (3.1Â in) of organic mulch. Spread evenly and not just at the base of the plants and trees. Add mulch to the soil of all the surrounding plants and shrubs. Be generous. You are looking for the mulch to commence a slow decay process and work its magic thereby enriching the soil around your fruit trees.
 The soil around your Fruit Plants And Trees has now been enriched by mulching.

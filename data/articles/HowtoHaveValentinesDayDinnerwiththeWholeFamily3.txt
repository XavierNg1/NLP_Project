 Before dinner, have everyone write a note for a member of the family. On the note, express why you love and care about various family members. Then, you can take turns reading these notes during dinner.You can print out templates for the notes on your computer. For example, write something like, "Dad, I love you because..." and then add a number of blank lines. You can print a card out like this for every member of the family.
 Have index cards on hand with conversation starters that involve stories about love and romance. Have questions like, "What was your most embarrassing first date?" and "What's your favorite love movie?"If you're married, you and your spouse can tell your kids the story of how you first met.
 Give everyone a sheet of paper. Then, say a word like "love", "kiss", or "beauty." Give everyone a set time to write down all the words they can think of associated with that word. Then, everyone can share.You can hand out stationary decorated with hearts for this game to keep with the Valentine's Day theme.
 You can bring out construction paper, glitter, glue, paint, markers, and other craft supplies at dessert. While people are enjoying their dessert, have them make cards for one another. This can be a fun end to a Valentine's Day dinner.

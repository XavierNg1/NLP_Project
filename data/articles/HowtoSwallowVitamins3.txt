 Some pills are time-release or oil soluble, so it’s not a good idea to grind them up.


NEVER crush or chew a pill without consulting with your doctor or pharmacist first. You could ingest the dosage too fast and harm yourself. , If it’s a tablet, crush it in a mortar and pestle or a pill crusher (usually available at your local health foods store or pharmacy). If it’s a capsule, break it open.
 Applesauce and pudding work well. Smoothies and milkshakes with strong flavors also work.


If you are working with a vitamin that you can’t crush, you can also put the whole thing in a semi-solid food., Try to swallow the whole bite.


Of course, don't take such a bit bite that you choke.
With luck, this will keep the pill from ever touching your tongue or throat.

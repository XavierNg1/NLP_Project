 Do you prefer free attractions or would you like to spend a little money here and there? Check with each official website to know of any admission prices, package deals, etc. If you are in a military family and hold a current/valid military I.D., you can receive military discounts, similar to "Kama'aina" (local) discounts. Haunama Bay has a small parking fee, but you can always take the city bus in & out to avoid additional drawbacks (guards will turn you away if the parking grounds are full).
 There's no reason to avoid a "Leonard's Malasada" stop, breakfast at Zippys, or a hot spam musubi on-the-go. Visit local fish markets to get quality sashimi (raw fish) or poke.
 If you are into those "Visitor Pennies", don't worry! There should be a few around the island. Waikiki, Ala Moana Shopping Center, and Ward Warehouse are the top Leeward places for a tourist shopper.
 Are you settling on car rentals or depending on city bus transportation? Just to note, speed limits are a maximum 50 mph (80 km/h) on state highways (e.g. Kamehameha Highway, Pali Highway, Kalanianaole Highway) and 60 mph (97 km/h) on freeways (H-1, H-201 (Moanalua Freeway), H-2, H-3)

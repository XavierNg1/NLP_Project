 Check your router's documentation and configuration utility for the ability to change the Xmit power of your router: the amount of power it uses to transmit the signal. Generally, you can boost this number by up to 50mW. Keep in mind that you risk overheating or damaging your router.
 Unscrew and replace the broadcast antenna on your router with a model that delivers more power. Not all routers allow for new antenna to be attached, but many do.
 A repeater is a piece of hardware that acts like a wireless network expander. The repeater takes the signal from your router and boosts it to increase the range.


Wireless repeaters are increasingly common and affordable and will probably be available in your local computer store, or on the Internet.
 Attach a wireless amplifier, also known as a booster, directly to your router. A booster can be more affordable than a repeater as they only increase the strength of your existing signal, rather than the strength and range.


Use a bi-directional amplifier to increase both your inward and outbound speeds.
 Note that a tinfoil router may boost your signal, but will also make it more directional.


Cut a tinfoil circle with the tinfoil on the inside of a piece of paper or some cardboard large enough to wrap around the router. If you want to get fancier than this, cut a shallow parabola and put the hole for the antenna at the focal point.
Place the tinfoil circle over the router.
Place the antenna in the center of the circle or parabola.

 Dogs, especially puppies, have accidents from time to time. While dogs that are not housebroken can urinate or defecate on the floor, even adult dogs have accidents from time to time. This can range from bathroom accidents to vomiting. Having a floor surface that can be easily cleaned will save you lots of headaches when your dog has an accident., If your office space has carpets and rugs, remove them or roll them up if possible. This will make cleaning up much easier when your puppy decides to go potty on the office floor.
 Sometimes hardwood and tile floors are cold, and you may need a rug to keep your feet warm while your work. If this is this case, don’t spend a ton of money on a fancy rug. Instead purchase a cheaper rug and, if possible, one that is machine washable. This will make cleaning up accidents easier. It will also be a little easier to digest your dog making dinner out of your floor coverings., If you have ever experienced a dog accident on a carpeted surface, you know how difficult it can be to remove the resulting stains and odors. A portable or handheld carpet cleaner can make cleanup a cinch. Try borrowing or buying one made specifically for cleaning up pet messes., When nature calls and your dog doesn’t make it through the doggy door, having a floor cleaner specially formulated to deal with doggy accidents will give you some peace of mind. You can find these in the pet supply section of most grocery or pet stores. You can also find a wide variety of options from online merchants.
 Removing electronics cords, pencils, markers, paper, and important documents and files from within a dog’s reach will help prevent your pooch from chowing down on irreplaceable or expensive items. Place these items high on shelves where your dog can’t reach, even if she does her best bouncing exercise.

 If you can't decide, then just pick a stroke name out of a hat. The main stroke is the front crawl, but many people struggle with butterfly the most. Whichever stroke you choose, however good you are at it at the start, learning the perfect technique for that stroke will help you with all of the others.;
, The best book for freestyle is "Swim Smooth," but there are other good books out there for other strokes. There are also many internet pages that will help you with your technique!

, Just go down to your local pool and practise all that you have learnt. Try using a lane and just swim up and down until you get it right. You can go along with a friend to keep you company or just enjoy the time by yourself. The more often you go, the better you'll get and the quicker it'll be before everyone is awed by your wonderful swimming strokes.
 It will be easier the next time as you will have picked up things from your last stroke. By the time you reach the last stroke, it should hardly take any time at all.
 This will give you professional coaching so that you'll be able to keep on improving as time goes on. In turn, if your club is competitive, this will give you a chance to swim and race against others and help you reach graded meet times for harder galas.

 Look in thrift stores for a good selection of shirts that you won't mind cutting up. Old shirts you have after losing a lot of weight are also good for this project. Dark brown shirts or stripes work particularly well.


You can wear this on its own, but it works best if you wear it over the laced up shirt described above.
 Be careful not to cut off any parts of the sleeves â€“ you're just aiming for one to three rips or tears on each sleeve. Try to balance the rips at different levels on each arm so that it's more interesting to look at.
 Cut a few tears here and there to expand on the ragged effect. Optionally, cut off about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to remove the machined hem and make the vest look more worn.
 Cut through the base of the collar and make a slit down the upper chest. Continue cutting all the way to the bottom of the vest, so that it hangs open.
 For extra flair, sew or iron on a patch showing a skull, King Neptune, or another nautical image. If you're feeling ambitious, you can embroider your own design.

 On your favorite Android device browser, head to a site that hosts digital copies of old games, such as Emuparadise.me, Theisozone.com, or coolrom.com, by typing it on the address bar and tapping Enter on your on-screen keyboard.;
, The search bar should be at the upper portion of the web page. Tap on it to summon your on-screen keyboard and type the name of the game whose ISO (digital copy format) file you wish to download.
 The search may yield multiple results, so you need to identify the right one to download. Scroll down the page, and tap the game title that matches the one for your system. Generally, the system (in this case, Sony PlayStation) should be stated below the game title. After tapping the game title, you should be taken to the file download page on the site.
 In the description page, scroll down until you see the “Download Now” button. Some sites will use hosting services for the files, so do not be alarmed when the link takes you to a site called FileHippo, Zippyshare, or something similar. Generally, they will display an ad on the screen, but you will be able to skip the ad after a few seconds by tapping on the “Skip Ad” button somewhere at the top of the screen.


You should then be taken to the download page, where you can tap the “Download Now” button, which will make a notification appear in the status bar of your device. Once the progress bar reaches 100%, the download will have finished. The default location for the ISO files should be in the Download folder in your device’s internal memory.
ISO files can vary in size, depending on the game. Games with more intense graphics and 3D models should be larger (like Resident Evil) than sidescrolling platformer games (like Megaman X). These files can range from 1.5-3GB+ to 500MB in size.

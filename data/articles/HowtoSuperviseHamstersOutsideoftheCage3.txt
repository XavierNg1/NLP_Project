 Hamsters have a tendency to chew on almost everything around them. If the holes are exposed or a wire is hanging out, your hamster may chew on it and get electrocuted.In order to protect your hamster from the dangers of electrical outlets, put child-proofing covers on outlets that are in the area you are keeping your hamster in.
 A common mistake owners can make is to forget to notify others that the rodent is out of its cage. This means that someone may open a door and allow the hamster to run away accidentally. They may even open the door and accidentally step on it.
 Closed doors don't always keep hamsters inside. Be sure to keep a blanket stuffed under any tight spaces, since hamsters have a tendency to try to escape.


Never give your hamster access to cracks or holes. Sense they love to escape and explore, they will run towards these places. If they get into tight spaces they are likely to get trapped, injured, or lost.
 Hamsters will go to the bathroom and chew on anything they come into contact with. If you are letting your hamster out of its cage, it is safer to remove things, such as sofas or rugs, you wouldn't want to get ruined. Pick up all clothing and other items that might be spoiled as well.


Hamsters love chewing on wooden items, so it is best to remove any you may have lying around.

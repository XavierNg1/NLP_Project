 Measure all of the dressing ingredients out and put them into a small mixing bowl. Use a whisk or fork to quickly mix the ingredients. Let the dressing sit for five minutes and then taste it. You can adjust the flavors best once they've had a little time to develop. You'll need to combine:3 tablespoons of tahini
3 tablespoons of water
1 tablespoon of dijon mustard
2 teaspoons of pure cane syrup or pure maple syrup
2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar or the juice of 1/2 lemon
1 pinch of freshly cracked pepper

, Get out a large serving bowl. Wash and shred 1 head of green cabbage. Transfer this to the bowl and add 1 1/2 cups (75 g) of ] carrots, 4 scallions (green onions) that you've sliced, and 12 pepperoncini (or banana peppers) that you've diced or julienned. Stir the cole slaw mix together.You don't have to use all of the peppers, if you prefer a milder cole slaw.
 Pour the spicy tahini dressing over the cole slaw mix and stir it together well. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the cole slaw and stir it again. If you want a tangier cole slaw, just drizzle a little extra vinegar on it. Sprinkle the cole slaw with sesame seeds before you serve it.You can serve the cole slaw immediately or chill it. Store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator, if you'd like to make it ahead.

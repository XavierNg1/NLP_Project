 Simplifying a numerical argument is an easy process: because absolute zero represents a distance between your number and 0, your answer will always be positive. Start by performing any operations within the absolute value bars to determine your expression.


For example, say you are trying to simplify the absolute value of an expression, -6 + 3. Since the entire expression is within the absolute value bars, do the addition first. The problem is now to simplify the absolute value of -3.;
, Once you have performed any operations inside the absolute value bars, you can simplify the absolute value. Whatever number you have as your argument, whether positive or negative, represents a distance from 0, so your answer is that number, and it is positive.


In the example above, the simplified absolute value is 3. This is true because the distance between 0 and -3 is 3.
 Optionally, you can also note your answer using a number line. This step can help you visualize absolute values and check your work.


For the example above, your number line should look like this.

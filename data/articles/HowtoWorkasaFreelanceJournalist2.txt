 Make sure that you're not pitching an article idea that they have already covered unless you can bring new information or a fresh perspective to the story. The best bet is to pitch article ideas on pieces that are missing. Look for niche stories that relate to the content that they usually publish, but a topic that's been underreported.For instance, if you're pitching for a local newspaper, you can get ideas from local gossip or controversies that may not have been covered yet.
Reporting on smaller, marginalized communities may be something that other journalists have not done.
If a report came out recently, you can try to be the first person to write a synopsis of how it impacts people.
 Many of your pitches are likely to get rejected, especially if you haven't developed a relationship with the editor. Play the odds and pitch often. Pitching your ideas to more than one editor can increase your chances of getting your article picked up. Take the assignment that comes first., One of the biggest turnoffs for editors is a poorly formulated pitch. A pitch that's riddled with spelling or grammatical errors shows the editor that you don't care and gives them a negative impression. Make sure to double check your pitch and edit it so that there are no errors., The top line of your story will be the first thing that editors will see and you want to make sure that it grabs their attention. Use actionable verbs and try to make the title of your article as catchy and compelling as possible.For instance, instead of writing "How to Eat Healthier" write "Eat Your Way to Great Health."

 Surgical correction carries the highest probability of a successful outcome, but does have drawbacks. These are that the pet needs a general anesthetic since the procedure is painful, and the dog would be distressed to have it done conscious.


Another disadvantage is the need to wear a buster collar for two to three weeks, which can cause considerable inconvenience if the dog is large and goes blundering into furniture at home.
 Medical treatment has the advantage that many good-natured dogs allow the ear to be drained while they are still conscious.


However, the main disadvantage is the variable outcome, with around half of cases needing a repeat procedure, and even then a successful result is not guaranteed.
On one hand, if medical treatment works well it is less expensive, less painful, and less invasive than surgery, but on the other hand it carries a lower success rate. It is entirely possible for a pet to have two medical treatments and still be left with a hematoma that then needs surgical drainage.
 Another consideration is cost. Because an anesthetic is involved the cost is often much greater than if the hematoma can be corrected medically.

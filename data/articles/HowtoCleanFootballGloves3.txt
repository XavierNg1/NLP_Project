 Whether you machine- or hand-wash your gloves, expect each wash to add some amount of wear-and-tear to your grips. To lessen the impact of repeated washes, refrain from washing after every single use. Wash once a week or every other week unless they desperately need it., Since you’re not going to be washing them after every single use, don’t ball them up in your bag or locker. Bring them home and hang them up on a clothesline or drying rack so they can breathe. Allow any sweat or other moisture to air-dry with plenty of circulation to keep smells from building., Even if you air your gloves out after each use, expect lingering sweat to start stinking them up at some point. Combat this by stuffing them with materials that will absorb the smell when not in use. Handy household items that can be used include:New tea bags
Dryer sheets
Newspaper

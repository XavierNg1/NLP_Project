 If you’ve had trouble convincing your parents to let you date, you want the first person you introduce to them to be worth it. Think hard about how much you like this person and if it’s worth it to try to date them. If you think you’d be embarrassed by them, it’s a good sign they aren’t the right one.


Being able to move on from a person you know isn’t the right fit is a sign of maturity.
Make sure that you want to date the person, instead of being infatuated with the idea of being in a relationship.
 You can subconsciously make a good impression on your potential date before your parents even have a chance to meet them.Talk about your date’s achievements and other things that are positive about them.


Try to think about what your parents like. If they like good grades, saying something like “I know this person in school, and they are great at math and English.”
Don’t talk about your date getting in trouble or doing bad things.
 Your parents might be more accepting to you dating a person that they know and trust. Dating a friend will also show your parents that you actually like the person, instead of just being obsessed with the idea of dating.


Introducing your future date among a group of friends is a good way to start off.
Introducing your date at a public place may ease tensions., If your parents are stern and overprotective, it’s a good idea to let your date know so they can prepare themselves. Never surprise your date with an unexpected meeting from your family because it could damage the relationship.


You can put your date’s mind at ease by saying “This may not go well, but I’ll still like you and want to date you, even if their reactions are bad.”
If the introduction goes badly, make sure to call your date later that night.

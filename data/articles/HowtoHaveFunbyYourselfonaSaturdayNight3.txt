 If the weather is nice, go for a walk. Connecting with nature is a great way to relax and enjoy yourself, so drive or walk over to the nearest park or nature reserve. If it's cold, you can still take a walk: snowy or wintry weather can be just as beautiful as summer weather. Just make sure to bundle up.
 Walking in an urban area can be just as interesting as walking in nature, and you're sure to see a lot of interesting shops and people along the way. If you live in or near a city, wander a bit downtown and explore the parks, boulevards and unique sights., Stargazing can be aided by telescopes or binoculars, but you don't need any special equipment to enjoy the stars. Simply find a quiet, dark place and look up. Try and identify constellations and planets, and break out the telescope if you have one. If you live in a densely populated area, you might have to take a drive to find an area with less light pollution.

, This will be your cookie cake crust.
 Whip until smooth and creamy.






Add 1 cup of granulated sugar and 1 tsp. of vanilla to cream cheese and mix well.






Add 4 eggs to mixture. Consider cracking the eggs into a separate bowl before sliding them into the cookie cake batter to avoid adding a bad egg or shells.






Whip 1 cup of sour cream and a pinch of salt to the batter. You can also add cookie crumbs to batter, about 6-8 crushed or fine ground. Mix until all ingredients are well combined.
 Fill almost to the top, but not so high that the batter spills.
 Place in a 275 degree preheated oven. The cookie sheet acts as a protective layer in the event the batter does spill over the top--this will help you avoid mess in your oven.
 Rotate the pan at least once during the baking cycle.
 Allow cakes to cool before transferring to the refrigerator. Leave in the refrigerator for at least four hours (or overnight) before serving cold.

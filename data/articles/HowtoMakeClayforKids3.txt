 You'll need:









1 cup cornstarch
2 cups baking soda
1 1/4 cups water
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
food coloring, optional

, Stir them together in a saucepan.
 Stir until the mixture is thoroughly combined and smooth.
 Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook until the mixture starts to look a bit dry. Stir constantly to keep the mixture from sticking.









When the mixture starts to look like dry mashed potatoes, it's finished cooking.
 Once the clay has clumped together in the saucepan, remove it from heat and transfer it to a plate.
 Once the clay is cool enough to handle, knead the clay until it's smooth.

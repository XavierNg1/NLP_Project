Any milk may have pus or blood mixed into it. The pus or milk may have a foul odor.The skin around the nipple may be damaged or cracked.If the mastitis is really bad, the glands may have abscesses or have gangrene.;

 If your dog has mastitis, they might respond negatively to their puppies. The dog may neglect or not pay attention to the puppies because of the swollen or painful teats. In some cases, the mother may even act aggressively towards the puppies.The dog may not allow the puppies to nurse because it’s too painful on the infected mammary glands., Due to the mother’s neglect, the puppies may not be able to nurse. This means the puppies may not thrive or grow. The puppies may end up whining or crying, or they may try to paw at the mother to get her to pay attention to them. If the neglect is prolonged without prompt care and assistance, the puppies may get sick or die. The milk may not have all the nutrients, so the puppies may end up malnourished.

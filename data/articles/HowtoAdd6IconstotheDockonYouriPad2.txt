 In the event that you have changed your mind and have decided to switch the applications in your iPad dock, changing the icons is as easy as putting them in. Just choose the application icon that you would like to remove from the dock.
 Tap and hold the icon until the icons are jiggling then slide the application icon from the dock towards the screen, and release.


The icons in the dock will automatically adjust their spacing from one another.
 Now, select the replacement application icon from the screen and just drag it towards the dock until the application icons inside the dock adjust themselves to accommodate the replacement icon, then release the icon.


Do the same process (Steps 1 to 3) if you prefer to replace the other application icons in the dock as well.
 When you have replaced the old application icons inside the dock with new ones, go ahead and lock the dock by pressing the Home button again.


If you see that the application icons have stopped jiggling, then you have successfully replaced and locked the icons in your iPad dock.

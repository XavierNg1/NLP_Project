 Citrus fruit that is less than 2.5cm/1 inch in diameter is often in abundance and the tree cannot carry all these fruits to maturity. Some of these will fall naturally as part of a thinning out.,


Citrus trees that are not watered adequately have a tendency to drop their fruit prematurely. The next season, be sure to mulch adequately around the tree to improve water retention and keep an eye on its need for more water.
Equally, over-watering can force fruit dropping.
 A citrus tree subjected to frosts as the fruit develops is more likely to drop the fruit.
 A lack of potash is a common cause of citrus trees dropping fruit before it is ready to eat. Always prefer a specialized citrus fertilizer over a more general one as the nutrient balance will be right for the tree.
 The citrus rust mite can cause discolored portions on citrus fruit; the mite is best squashed rather than sprayed as you will also lose beneficial life on the tree. And the fruit still tastes just fine and is not damaged by this mite.

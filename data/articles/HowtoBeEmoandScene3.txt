 Scene kids place emphasis on socializing, partying and generally having a good time. On the other hand, emos are very introverted and emotional. If you want to be both, you’ll need to heavily vary your moods so that you will fit the characteristics of each side.


If you tend toward being more emo, work to balance it out by being friendlier and more outgoing.
If you are more on the scene side, learn how to tone done your personality occasionally. Practice introspection and spend some time alone every now and then.
 Emos tend to hang out with other emos exclusively. The same goes for scene kids – they usually stay with their own crowd. There’s no rule that you have to do that! Make friends with people that are in both cliques.


Don’t spend too much time with one or the other.
Try to divide your time equally between the two and enjoy the activities and conversation on both sides.
 An online personality is an important part of scene culture, especially via social media and networking platforms. They document their daily activities publicly, usually in great detail. Profile images of scene kids are usually highly stylized and frequently posted. Emos have a social media presence, but it’s usually more understated and often focuses on music. They like to post music videos and quote song lyrics in their status updates.You’ll need to alternate representing one side or the other, or mix it up so that you fit in with both.
Post music videos of both emo and scene bands.
Make sure your profile images are ambiguous – no one should be able to easily place you into one camp or the other, because you’ll be sporting the hairstyles and clothing styles of both.

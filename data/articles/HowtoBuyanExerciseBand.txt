Determine if you will use the bands as your primary method of strength training or as a supplement to an already established workout regimen. If you are considering using bands exclusively, you might need to purchase more than one.
Narrow down your search by specifying a need for physical therapy exercise bands or regular exercise bands. Physical therapy resistance bands have a more specialized purpose and are much less intense than other bands.;

Select a band with a strip design if you want to purchase the most basic device. Strip exercise bands are simply wide pieces of rubber cut to different lengths. They do not have handles, but they are the most inexpensive choice.
Settle on a tube design if you feel handles would be more comfortable or want to purchase a more durable band. Within the category of tube bands, you can choose between hard plastic and soft foam handles. Both types work; it is a personal comfort decision.



Acknowledge the 4 main levels. Light bands are typically long and thin and provide between 3 and 5 lbs. (1.36 and 2.27 kgs) of resistance. These bands are best for beginners. Medium bands allow for about 8 lbs. (3.63 kg) of resistance. Heavy bands can provide as much as 12 to 15 lbs. (5.44 to 6.8 kgs) of resistance and are appropriate for people who are already fit. The heaviest band, which might be labeled "extra-heavy band" should be employed by experienced users. These extra-heavy bands can provide as much as 20 lbs. (9.07 kgs) of resistance.



Look for features such as door attachments, removable handles, clips, ankle cuffs and rings. Some exercise bands will come with these extras.



Buy a starter kit if you are looking for a full workout. These kits will often come with instructional videos. Purchasing 1 band typically will cost between 5 and 10 dollars.



Inspect the band packaging, take them out and hold them in your hands. You should be able to tell if they feel stable and durable.

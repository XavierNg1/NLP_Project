 If you are in the market for a major life overhaul, you may want to start with some of your habits. Habit change is a serious undertaking. However, when you replace negative habits with positive ones, you will notice your life starting to change for the better.


Pick out a habit that has been holding you back from reaching your goals or being the best version of yourself. Poor habits may include swearing, lying, cheating, excessively drinking alcohol, smoking, watching too much TV, drinking too much alcohol, being late, or procrastinating.
The best way to break a bad habit is to find a positive one to replace it. For instance, if you want to stop watching so much TV, you might find another activity you could do during this time like reading, coloring, or working on a puzzle. Create a reward system so that you reinforce you choosing the other activity over TV.For more serious habits like drugs, alcohol, or binge-eating, you may need to seek professional assistance., Suffering from burnout or lack of inspiration at work can lead to dissatisfaction in many other areas of life. If you don’t like what you are doing for a living, come up with a feasible plan to advance in your chosen field or switch fields altogether.

Career counseling may help you narrow down a career path of interest.You might also learn information about your career aspirations by reexamining your values and the best possible future self exercise.
 If your hometown lacks opportunity, culture, or other features that are important to you, it may be time to relocate. Or, maybe you love your current job, but don’t enjoy the daily commute. Talk with your family, partner, or close friends to help you decide whether moving could be the right choice for you., If you feel like you are stuck in a style rut, pressing the reset button may include a makeover. It’s up to you how big you want the change to be. If you feel like your wardrobe is out of date or colorless, go shopping for some newer pieces that flatter your body. Include some pops of color to brighten things up.


On the other hand, an appearance change could also involve getting a haircut, losing weight, getting your teeth whitened, or wearing makeup., Rebooting your life also includes your social connections. If you are surrounded by unsupportive people who mistreat you or fail to appreciate you, it’s time to nix those relationships. A spouse that verbally abuses you, a friend who always cancels at the last minute, or a boss who fails to recognize your contributions can all affect your life satisfaction.Think carefully about how each person in your life makes you feel. Cut out negative influences and expand your circle to include positive people. If you aren’t able to completely terminate certain relationships, get as much distance as you can.

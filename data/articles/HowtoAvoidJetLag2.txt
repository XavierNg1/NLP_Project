 To avoid jet lag, itâ€™s important that you get enough sleep on the plane. Pack a travel pillow and an eye mask to make sleeping on the flight easier. Bring a blanket or a big scarf that you can use to stay warm while you sleep.You can also pack headphones or earplugs to block out noise or distractions on the flight.
 Only take sleeping pills during the flight if you have taken them before and at a low dosage. One sleeping pill is often good for an overnight flight to help you sleep. Taking more than one can end up making you feel groggy when you land, and could end up making your jet lag worse.Ask your doctor for advice on dosage and when you should take the sleeping pill during your flight.
 If you wear a watch, change the time so it matches the timezone of your destination. You can also adjust the clock on your cellphone. Doing this will help you get accustomed to the new timezone and prepare you for a new sleeping and eating schedule.If you are not sure what the new timezone will be at your destination, ask a flight attendant for this information.
 It is common to get dehydrated on the plane, and dehydration can make jet lag much worse. Try to drink at least 8 ounces of water for every hour you are in the air. Sip from a water bottle in your carry-on and request water from the flight attendant.Avoid drinking alcohol or caffeinated beverages on the flight, as they can interfere with your sleep.
 Try to get up and walk in the aisle of the plane, especially during a long flight. Doing light exercise and moving your body can help improve your blood circulation on the flight. It may also help you get to sleep more easily, especially if you go for a short walk around before you go to sleep.You can also try doing light stretching in the aisle, such as standing side stretches.
Deep breathing and meditation may also help you stay calm and relaxed during the flight.

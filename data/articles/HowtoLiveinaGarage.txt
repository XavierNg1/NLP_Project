 Garages tend to be dirty, dusty and oily. Remove all contaminated products and stains. Dust away and sweep up all sawdust shavings, dirt, and other unidentifiable stuff.


Remove all the junk, boxes and bicycles. You want to be able to get around; only keep what cannot be left out in the elements inside the garage.;
, Check if the walls and floor are damp. Dampness comes from the earth, leaky pipes, or rain. Damp causes mold which stinks (musty odours), wrecks your clothes and gives you a chronic cough because it's both a toxin and an allergen.


Consider whether it is possible to waterproof the outside.



Clean all the windows.
, Add your chosen furniture and furnishings. If you're renovating, you might like to cover good items and store them while buying secondhand furniture for use in the garage. And if you've lost your items due to a disaster, secondhand furniture is a good option.


Shop at local flea markets to save money. Make sure all items are workable and clean.
Put all the furniture in the room. Arrange it so it can be roomy, functional, and not block other furniture.
 A shower can be linked to outside drainage to prevent the water accumulating in the garage.
 Partition off bedrooms if sharing with other people. Simply wooden walls will suffice for this, plus a door or curtain for the entry to each "room".
 A sink, stove, and eating table are essentials. Food preparation can be done on the table if there is no space for an additional bench.
 It will be a lot colder in the garage than in a house. All heating needs to be safe as a garage is easy to burn down. Electric heaters should be the sort that stop if tipped over, and all gas or wooden fires require flues to vent the toxic elements straight outside.

 There are as many different graphing strategies out there as there are types of functions, far too many to completely cover here. If you're struggling, and estimations won't work, check out articles on:

Graphing inequalities (not functions, but still useful information).
 Zeros, also called x-intercepts, are the points where the graph crosses the horizontal line on the graph. While not all graphs even have zeros, most do, and it is the first step you should take to get everything on track. To find zeros, simply the entire function to zero and solve. For example:


F(x)=2x2−18{\displaystyle F(x)=2x^{2}-18}


Set F(x) equal to zero: 0=2x2−18{\displaystyle 0=2x^{2}-18}


Solve: 0=2x2−18{\displaystyle 0=2x^{2}-18}


18=2x2{\displaystyle 18=2x^{2}}


9=x2{\displaystyle 9=x^{2}}


x=3,−3{\displaystyle x=3,-3}, This is usually points where the graph does not exist, like where you are dividing by zero. If your equation has a variable in a fraction, like y=14−x2{\displaystyle y={\frac {1}{4-x^{2}}}}, start by setting the bottom of the fraction to zero. Any places where it equals zero can be dotted off (in this example, a dotted line at x=2 and x=-2), since you cannot ever divided by zero. Fractions, however, are not the only places you can find asymptotes. Usually, all you need is some common sense:

Some squared functions, like F(n)=n2{\displaystyle F(n)=n^{2}} can never be negative. Thus there is an asymptote at 0.

Unless you're working with imaginary numbers, you cannot have −1{\displaystyle {\sqrt {-1}}}For equations with complex exponents, you may have many asymptotes.
 Simply pick a few values for x and solve the function. Then graph the points on your graph. The more complicated the graph, the more points you'll need. In general, -1, 0, and 1 are the easiest points to get, though you'll want 2-3 more on either side of zero to get a good graph.For the equation y=5x2+6{\displaystyle y=5x^{2}+6}, you might plug in -1,0,1, -2, 2, -10, and 10. This gives you a nice range of numbers to compare.

Be smart selecting numbers. In the example, you'll quickly realize that having a negative sign doesn't matter -- you can stop testing -10, for example, because it will be the same as 10.
 This gives you an idea of the general direction of a function, usually as a vertical asymptote. For example -- you know that eventually, y=x2{\displaystyle y=x^{2}} gets really, really big. Just one additional "x" (one million vs. one million and one) makes y much bigger. There are a few ways to test end behavior, including:

Plug in 2-4 large values of x, half negative and half positive, and plot the points.

What happens if you plugged in "infinity" for one variable? Does the function get infinitely bigger or smaller?

If the degrees are the same in a fraction, like F(x)=x3−2x3+4{\displaystyle F(x)={\frac {x^{3}}{-2x^{3}+4}}}, simply divide the first two coefficients (1−2{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{-2}}} to get your ending asymptote (-.5).If the degrees are different in a fraction, you must divide the equation in the numerator by the equation in denominator by Polynomial Long Division.
 Once you have 5-6 points, asymptotes, and a general idea of end behavior, plug it all in to get an estimated version of the graph.
 Graphing calculators are powerful pocket computers that can give exact graphs for any equation. They allow you to search exact points, find slope lines, and visualize difficult equations with ease. Simply input the exact equation into the graphing section (usually a button labeled "F(x) = ") and hit graph to see your function at work.

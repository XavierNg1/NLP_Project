 If you are at risk of arrhythmia, there are medications that may be prescribed by your physician to control your heart rate. These are not over-the-counter drugs and are only available on prescription.



Anti-arrhythmic drugs: Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone and procainamide are some of the drugs that target Beta receptors and certain ionic channels located in the heart to normalize the heart rate as well as control blood pressure.
 Cardioversion is a procedure in which a cardiologist uses a machine to give the heart an electrical shock to help it conduct electricity within your heart and help restore a normal rhythm. This is done by placing patches or paddles on your chest and releasing the electric current into your chest.


This can be used in non-emergency conditions to help correct arrhythmias, especially in the case of blocked pacemakers., A doctor can identify the specific area of the heart where arrhythmias occur the most. With this procedure, your doctor threads catheters through your blood vessels to your heart. The catheters then emit extreme heat, extreme cold, or radio wave frequency to block the area of the heart that is causing the abnormal rhythm., Doctors may implant a pacemaker, which is a tiny device that is implanted in your body that facilitates electrical impulses to the damaged node in the heart to help it pump more slowly. Nodes are the source of the electrical impulses that help the heart to pump blood.


If the pacemaker feels an irregular heart rhythm, it emits an electrical impulse that stimulates your heart to beat correctly.
Also ask about implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). ICDs are very similar to a pacemaker except they help the ventricles, or lower portions, of you heart. They also emit electrical pulses to keep your heart at a correct rhythm when the normal rhythm falters.

 Simply saying “Please” and “Thank you” can show other people that you are well-mannered and care about their feelings. Thank people for gifts, help, and thoughtful consideration. Think about how your actions affect others. If you’re not sure how someone feels, ask them, “Do you mind if I do this?”For example, if you use your cell phone in public, be mindful of those around you and don’t talk loudly or carry on long conversations with someone in front of you.
 If you need or want something, ask for it instead of demanding it. People like to feel like they have a choice and that their help is appreciated. Respect other people’s needs and consider their feelings when you make a request. Allow people to feel like they can say, “No” without fearing your wrath or upset.For example, say, “I’d really appreciate your help with this project. Can you show me how to do this?” instead of saying, “I can’t do this and need you to show me.”
If someone cannot complete a request, keep your cool. Everyone has their own schedules and needs, too.
 If you tend to be a loudmouth, consider taking a few steps back and finding out what it feels like to be more silent. If your first impulse is to speak, work on taking a beat before responding. This can help you think before spreading rumors, saying stupid comments, or insulting someone.Your comments may be annoying or unwarranted. If you want to say something, let other people speak first before chiming in.

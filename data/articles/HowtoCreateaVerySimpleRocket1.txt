 Put two matches on aluminum foil with the plain ends sticking out and the match tips pointing in. Roll the matches up like a burrito. Twist one end of the foil tightly around a match and leave the other end rolled loosely., Stick the matchstick of the tightly rolled match into a piece of cardboard. This will hold that match in place. Being anchored in the cardboard also allows you to aim the match and launch in whatever direction you choose., Use a candle or lighter to heat the foil. Put the flame directly under the area of foil that conceals the match heads. When the matches get hot enough, they will ignite. This will send the loose match shooting out of the aluminum holder.When the match heads ignite, gas is rapidly formed and this expanding gas forces the loose match out of the aluminum holder with a considerable amount of force.

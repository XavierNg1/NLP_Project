 For this method, you can use either toothpaste or a mixture of baking soda and water. Both should give you great results in a short amount of time.If you use baking soda, combine three parts baking soda and one part water to create a paste. You want a consistency that is similar to that of toothpaste. If it is too thin, add more baking soda. If it is too dry, add more water., Apply a dab of your chosen cleaning paste to a soft cloth. Then use it to scrub each piece of silver. Be sure to scrub all areas of your silverware equally to achieve have a nice, even finish.You may have to rub a bit vigorously, especially if your silver is very tarnished.
If this method does not seem to be working, try allowing the paste to sit on the silverware for several minutes before you begin scrubbing again.
 Once your silver is satisfactorily clean, rinse all remnants of baking soda or toothpaste off with warm water. Then buff each piece of silver with a clean, dry cloth.


Be sure to get all of the residue off. Failing to rinse your silverware thoroughly will leave it dull looking.
Drying thoroughly helps prevent unsightly water spots from forming on your silverware.

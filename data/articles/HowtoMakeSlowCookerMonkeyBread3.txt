 In a medium bowl, mix together the softened cream cheese, pumpkin puree, 2 tablespoons (25 g) white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon (2 mL) pumpkin pie spice. Stir the ingredients until the mixture is smooth., In another small bowl or cup, set aside at least 2 tablespoons (25 g) of the butter and brown sugar mixture to drizzle on the rolls later., Pull the cinnamon rolls apart so that they’re separated, then slice each one in half. Press each piece down with your palm so that it’s somewhat flattened. Spoon a teaspoon (5 mL) of the cheese filling on top. Place another piece of dough on top. Press down on the sides to seal in the sandwiched filling, then roll the dough into a ball.Repeat this step until you’ve used all of the dough.
 Dip a dough ball into the mixture, rolling it for an even coating. Alternately, you can place the balls and butter/sugar mixture into a resealable bag, and shake until the dough balls are coated., Spray a light coating of nonstick cooking spray inside the bottom of the cooker. After placing the balls inside in a single layer, pour the remaining butter on top. Sprinkle chopped pecans over the dough, if desired., Cover the slow cooker with two paper towels, then put the lid on top. If your cooker tends to run hot, make sure to check the dough after one hour, and every half-hour after that.The paper towels create a barrier so that condensation won’t drip onto the monkey bread.
The monkey bread is done cooking when its center isn’t doughy. Try inserting a knife or toothpick; it may come out with some filling on it, but it shouldn’t have any sticky dough.
 Turn off the cooker and remove the lid. Let it sit for five minutes. Then take a knife and loosen the edges of the monkey bread. Use one or more spatulas or pie servers to transfer the monkey bread onto serving plates.Top the servings with syrup or a cream cheese glaze, if desired.

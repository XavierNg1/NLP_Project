An old fashioned hand colander. This looks like a perforated cone with a wooden pestle. This is the most work intensive of the colanders available. You put the apples inside and smash them through the holes.
A Foley Food Mill. This looks like a saucepan with a perforated bottom and a paddle with handle that is turned to press the food through the grate. This is still quite labor intensive. You put the apples inside, place the mill over the sauce container, and press the cooked apples through the holes. Stems, seeds and skin are left behind, so you will need to do this in batches, removing the seeds, etc. periodically.
Victorio Strainer. This clamps to your counter top. You place the apples in the hopper at the top and crank the handle to corkscrew the apples through the long, cone shaped colander. Applesauce comes out the strainer; Seeds, stems and skin come out the hole on the end. You will need two catching containers... one for sauce, one for the un-sauceable portions of the apples.
A strainer attachment to a food processor (shown in the pictures) works like the Victoria Strainer, but the machine provides the cranking power, saving your arm a lot of work.
 Keep two containers under the outlets. One for sauce, One for stems/seeds etc.

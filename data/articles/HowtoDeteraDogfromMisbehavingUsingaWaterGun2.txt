 When punishing your dog with a water gun, do not call your dog over to receive the punishment. By doing this, you are not catching your dog in the act. Instead, your dog will think that it is being reprimanded for coming to you when called, which you do not want., Try not to let your dog see the water gun, or see that you are dispensing the water from the gun. The punishment should not be associated with you, but with the misbehavior. If your dog comes to associate you with the water gun, then it is more likely to engage in the behavior when you are not around.Keep the water gun in your back pocket, and make sure your dog does not see you using it.
To prevent your dog from seeing you use the water gun, approach your dog from behind and spray the back of its head or body.
 Try to punish your dog every time the misbehavior occurs. If you only punish your dog sporadically, then it will learn that it still occasionally gets to do the unwanted behavior.This can cause your dog to either do the behavior when you are not around, or decide that performing the behavior is worth the risk of getting punished.
 This method of punishment does not usually work on dogs that enjoy water, like Labradors, Golden retrievers, American and Irish water spaniels, Portuguese water dogs, labradoodles, and general retriever dogs. Therefore, you will need to use a different method of punishment if your dog likes water, or is one of these dogs.Instead, take away one of your dog's favorite toys, or place it in time-out (time-outs should not be longer than a minute). Make sure to accompany the punishment with a verbal addition like, "Bad dog" or "No."On the other hand, dogs that dislike water are Chihuahuas, pugs, Yorkshire terriers, Pekingese breeds, Dachshunds, Maltese breeds, Shih Tzus, Pomeranians, Chinese cresteds, and Lhasa Apsos.

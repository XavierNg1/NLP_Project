 This method works well with these makeup products because they are usually oil-based. Dish soap will not harm most fabrics. Using the tissue, sheet of toilet paper, or paper towel, gently pat the stain to remove any excess makeup. Do not rub the stain as this could make the makeup spread.
 You can run your fingers through some water, then lightly pat the stain. You can also find a 1/2 teaspoon, then pour it over the stained area. Do not use hot water as it can cause the fabric to absorb the stain. , If you are worried about how the soap may affect silk or wool, try it on a small area first before attempting to clean the stain. With your index finger, gently spread the soap so it covers the entire stained surface. A thin layer of soap on the stain is all you need. When choosing a dish soap, pick a strong grease fighting formula at your local grocery or convenience store.
 Use a cloth towel to gently massage the soap into the stain. Start from the outside corners and work in; rub the soap into the stain in a circular motion. A small terry cloth would work best for this step. The loops of the cloth help remove the makeup from the fabric. If this is not available, you can use a regular hand towel.


To help with stubborn stains, use an old toothbrush to massage the soap into the stain instead of a cloth.
 This will allow the soap to do the stain-fighting without the burden of washing. Do not wait until the soap is all dry.
 Do not rub the stain, rather dab the area so the towel absorbs the soap and makeup. Rubbing can create friction and leave more makeup or towel pieces behind.
 Depending on how old the stain is, you may have to repeat these steps until you see a significant amount of makeup is removed from your clothing. The bigger the stain, the longer this process may take.

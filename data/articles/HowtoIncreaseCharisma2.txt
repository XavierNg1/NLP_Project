 If you are in a social situation, put away your phone, tablet, PC, and any other distracting electronic device. You cannot connect with others if you are constantly emerged in your devices. At a social engagement, give you full and undivided attention to the situation and people in front of you. You can connect with other people at a later time. If you are an IPhone user, you can turn on the “Do Not Disturb function to prevent calls and text messages coming through until the function is turned off. This will prevent the temptation to check your phone. , It is difficult to be present in a situation if you keep thinking about how excited you are to get out of your tight jeans or itchy dress. Wear clothing that is appropriate and comfortable, so you can focus on the present situation.
 When you are engaged in a conversation, do not think about how you will respond while someone is speaking. Instead, focus on what they are saying, and when it is your turn to respond, take two seconds before you're answering. For example, if someone is telling a story about hiking with their dog, do not think of a story of you hiking with your own doggie as they are speaking. Fully engage in their story, then share your own.
Empathize with the person’s story and share the same feelings with them. Say, for example, that you are as impressed as her, because this reminds you a similar event.
 To become present in situations, try being present with yourself. Try meditating by going to a quiet place, making yourself comfortable and focusing on deep breathing. Focus on how your body feels as you inhale and exhale. Repeat a single word or mantra or listen to repetitive music that calms you and clears your mind. Spend at least five minutes each day doing nothing and being at peace with that.

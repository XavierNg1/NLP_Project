 Add equal parts of white glue and shaving cream to a large bowl. Mix the two together until they are fully combined in a thick cream.








Be sure to use a shaving foam, not shaving gel.
If you’re concerned about the paint sticking to your spoons, you can use chopsticks, popsicle sticks, or even straws to mix the glue and shaving cream together.;
, Once the glue and shaving cream are completely mixed, set out a plastic cup for each shade of paint that you plan to make. Add a little of the glue and shaving cream mixture to each cup.








It can be difficult to wash the paint out of containers, so it’s best to use disposable plastic cups that you can toss away when you’re done with the paint.
 To color the paint, add some food coloring to each cup in your chosen shade. The amount that you’ll need depends on how much of the paint mixture is in each cup and how dark you want the shade to be. Stir the coloring into the paint mixture until it’s completely blended.








The more food coloring that you add, the darker the paint will be. However, it’s best to start with a small amount, such as 5 to 10 drops, and see if you’re happy with the color before adding more.
When you’re adding the food coloring, keep in mind that the paint will dry darker that it appears when it’s wet.
 When you have all the paint shades that you want, use a brush to paint it on a paper item in whatever design you like. Be sure to use a good amount of the paint to ensure that it has a puffy texture.








Some designs that you may want to create with your puffy paints include a rainbow and fluffy white clouds, a bouquet of flowers, a moon and stars, or a bunch of balloons.
The puffy paints are also ideal for holiday designs. For example, create a Christmas tree or menorah, hearts for Valentine's Day, or a jack o'lantern for Halloween.
Allow the paint to dry completely before hanging or displaying the painting. It usually takes 4 to 6 hours.

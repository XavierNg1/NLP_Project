 Hauling a backpack to and from class every day, whether you’re a kindergartner or a college student, can be painful and uncomfortable. Sort through your items and decide what you absolutely need to take to class, keeping in mind that the total weight of your backpack should not exceed 15% of your total body weight. Separate notebooks, textbooks, and pens and pencils into individual piles., School backpacks always seem to have bits of ephemera floating around their pockets and main compartments. Instead of letting these miscellaneous items get out of control, organize them into individual bags. Keep pencils, pens, and markers together in a pencil pouch. Toiletry items such as hand sanitizer, tissues, or chapstick can placed in another separate bag to be tossed into the backpack.
 Order your items in “heaviest” to “least heavy” and place these in your backpack working from the back out. Typically the order will start with textbooks, then notebooks or binders, then smaller personal books, and pencil pouches last.
 Keep anything that might need to be grabbed quickly in the outer pockets, such as pencils or a cell phone. Add liquids or items that might be wet, such as water bottles or a wet umbrella, to the outer pockets as well. Toss your sweatshirt or jacket in the top, and you’re set!, Because your backpack is going into use on a daily basis, old papers and other useless bits pile up quickly. Once every 1-2 weeks, pull out and recycle any unnecessary papers from your bag. Doing this will keep your backpack light and organized.

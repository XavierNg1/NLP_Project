 Loosely wrap a soft measuring tape around your dog's neck. Add 3 inches (7.6 cm) to this length to get your dog's collar size.
 Grosgrain ribbon is a special type of ribbed or corded ribbon. The length of the ribbon should match your dog's collar size.
 Remove any frayed ends with pinking shears.
 Fold 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the ribbon underneath itself at each end. Stitch the ends in place using a sewing machine.
 Cut one piece of rhinestone dangle and one strip of rhinestone trim. The length of both pieces should almost match the new length of the grosgrain ribbon, but you should have 1 inch (2.5 cm) less of the dangle and trim.
 Use a sewing machine to stitch the trim to the bottom of the ribbon.
 Use a needle and thread to hand sew the end of the dangle directly above the trim, in the center of the collar.
 Use a needle and thread to stitch the socket ends onto one end of the collar, over the hem. Stitch the ball ends on the reverse side of the other end.

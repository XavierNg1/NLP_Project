 Tragedy may not be on a global or national level. Tragedy may happen when someone on your Facebook or Twitter suddenly loses a family member. When this happens, you can offer support to the person to let them know you care.For example, you can simply like the post. You may decide to comment to the person with something like, “I’m sorry for your loss” or “You are in my thoughts.”
You may consider sending the person a private message with more personal words.
 When tragedy happens, you may join in the collective conversation and share your memories with others. This may be appropriate if someone well-known in the community or a famous person dies, or if a well-known landmark was destroyed in some tragic way.You can share photos of you and the person, or a photo of you at the building or landmark destroyed.
Write a post with your favorite memories of the person or the place. Sharing good memories in a time of tragedy can be a way to heal.
 If you are part of a community struck by tragedy, either geographically or culturally, you can use social media to grieve and process the tragedy. When something happens close to us, reaching out to other individuals who may understand our loss can be comforting.


You may make posts about how affected you are by the loss. You may talk about your sadness and grief, your fear, or your anger.

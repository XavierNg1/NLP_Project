, Take the two straps and tie them in a simple knot but not sliding one of the straps through all the way creating a loop. Pull tight., Don't pull it all the way creating a second loop. Remember the straps still should be tied together at this point so it should be impossible to pull the straps all the way through., Make sure the opening of the bag is facing you and just pull the left strap and then pull both!

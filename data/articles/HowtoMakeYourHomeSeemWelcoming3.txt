 When a person comes in, they're going to want to know several things, such as where to set there belongings down. You should make that as obvious as possible by having a place right by the door where they can put their things. It also helps to give your guest a small tour when they come in, so they know where the bathroom is, where they can get a drink of water, and so on., One way to make guests feel welcome is to simply offer a welcome to them. Let them know that they are free to wander about (if they are), and invite them to ask for anything they need, as well as help themselves.For instance, you could say, "Welcome! We're so glad you're here. Feel free to make yourself at home and get anything you need, but don't be afraid to ask, too."

, While your home doesn't need to pass the white-glove test, a reasonably clean home makes guests feel more welcome. If you haven't cleaned, your guests may feel like that you haven't prepared for them, making them feel unwelcome.However, a perfectly clean (sterile) home can seem uninviting, too, as guests may not feel they can relax and be themselves.
One way you can "clean" is to put away clutter. Have functional, pretty organizers around to make it easy on yourself.

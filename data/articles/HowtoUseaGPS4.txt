 Most GPS devices can find much more than addresses these days. Try searching "Indian Food," "Post Offices," "Gas," "Rock Climbing Gyms," or whatever else you are interested in and see what pops up. This can be incredibly useful when you are in a new city, or if you just feel like finding the closest burrito shop.


Apps and Internet enabled GPS (like those found on phones) will always have this feature.
Many portable GPS devices have a section labeled "Nearby Locations" or "Find Locations" that list businesses within a short radius of your current location.
 Geocaching is when people hide objects in the world with GPS coordinates. It is a global community that prides itself on sharing and exploration, and can be a great way to see the outdoors. To Geocache, buy a GPS and sign up for one of the many internet-based services and forums.
 Most modern GPS devices and apps can be turned on while you run or bike, and store the information on your speed, elevation, and distance for later. You will need a specific app like NikeFit, MapMyRun, or AppleHealth to get the most out of this feature.
 Because smartphones are constantly hooked up to a GPS, you can use them to find lost or stolen phones if you act quickly. Download a tracking app on for your phone and sync it with your computer to always keep tabs on your phone's location.


Use "Find my iPhone," by going to the Find my iPhone Website and inputting your Apple username.
Log onto Google's online "Device Manager" to find your lost/stolen android phone without a tracking app. You can even download "Android Lost" to your phone remotely to get your phone's coordinates.

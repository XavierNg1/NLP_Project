 The towel you use will probably get stained, so choose an old towel you do not mind damaging. Place the towel underneath the fabric you're cleaning on a flat surface, like a counter. Make sure the towel is thick enough to absorb excess moisture., If you have an extra unused toothbrush, use this. You can also purchase a cheap toothbrush at a drug store. Get the toothbrush completely saturated in Murphy's oil. This method works best with a very wet toothbrush., Rub the toothbrush into the stain, adding new Murphy's oil as necessary. Move the towel underneath as needed to absorb excess liquid. Rub the stain until suds appear and then keep rubbing until the stain is mostly faded., Take a rag or sponge and douse it in some water and mild dishwashing soap. Rub the rag or sponge over the stain until it comes out completely., Take a clean sponge and saturate it with clean water. Rub the sponge into the clothing to remove the Murphy's oil and dish soap.Keep rubbing the sponge on the fabric until the water from the sponge runs clear.
 Once the stain is removed and you've rinsed out the garment, you can launder the garment as you usually would. When it comes out of the wash, the stain should be completely gone.

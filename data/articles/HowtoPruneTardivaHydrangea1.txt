 It is always a good idea to sterilize your garden shears before using them in order to prevent the spread of any possible illnesses that could be trapped on the blades from previous pruning.


Using a little bit of dish soap should be enough to remove any untoward diseases that have left residue on your shears.;
, A quick removal of stems that are damaged, diseased, frail, or at odd angles is recommended.


This will help keep the hydrangea bush healthy and should be the first step before trimming the plant into shape.
Heavy pruning generally will not harm these plants, so the occasional slip of the shears probably won’t hurt the hydrangeas too much.
 The best way to get a good shape overall is to leave a mixture of old and new growth standing, so that there is plenty of support for the floppy new flowers.


Without a bit of old growth remaining for support, the new flowers and branches will be floppy and limp.
This could cause them to die over time.
 If you are growing your Tardiva hydrangeas in a tree formation, you should be careful not to remove any of the plant’s upper limbs or the main trunks that contribute to the plant’s particular shape.


By pruning the base, your plant will grow much larger at its top rather than its base, contributing to a tree-like look.
This is because the hydrangea will grow several feet taller before it produces blossoms, giving it time to gain height relative to its width.
However, if you want to reduce your plant to a shrub, then go ahead and prune these upper branches and the hydrangea will revert to its naturally shrubby state.
 Parts that are not diseased can be broken into small pieces and thrown in the compost pile.


If one does not have a compost pile or the parts are diseased, the debris can be placed in paper bags and left out for the local waste removal personnel to cart away.

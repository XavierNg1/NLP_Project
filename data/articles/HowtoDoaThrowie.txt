Remember to have an extra piece of paper on the bottom ONLY if you are using a permanent marker or something that will bleed through the paper.

A good advice to follow would be to take the letter, take it apart and shape it in your mind. Add dents bend the letter a bit, twist them up, do whatever your imagination takes you. By doing this not only will you have a unique style, you will have YOUR own style.
,, be creative with your letters. if your letters look like other taggers then you will be referred to as a "toy" which means an inexperienced graffiti tagger.


Once you have your letters done, it's time to add in 3-D effects. just like in this photo , the 3-D effects are the thick black lines. Also known as shadowing.
A shield is basically an extra outline on the outside of the letters.A shield is also optional. Most taggers use shields to add detail to the throwie and some just leave it plain.
After everything is done, you have your throwie.

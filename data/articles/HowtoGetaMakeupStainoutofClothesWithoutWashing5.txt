 Choose nylon tights that you would not care to get dirty. The majority of tights are made of nylon and microfiber, followed by cotton and microfiber. Check the tag of your tights; you will most likely own many made of nylon.


Nylon tights will not harm your clothing. You can wash the nylons, and they'll be good as new.
 Blow at the stain to remove any excess powder sitting on top of the fabric. You can either blow on the stain using your breath, or use a hairdryer. Make sure to use the hairdryer on the coolest setting. Using heat will only help the makeup set into the fabric, which you do not want.
Hold the clothing taut and horizontal in front of you. Blow the makeup completely away from you so none of the powdered makeup gets back on your clothing.
 Holding a section of the tights in one hand, use them to gently brush away at the stain. This brushing motion will pick up any remaining powdered makeup. Keep brushing until all the makeup is gone.

 Find the date of your dog's birthday. If your dog's birthday is on a weekday or inconvenient day for you, make the party date on a weekend close to your dog's birthday. *If your dog is without a pedigree, you still should check your calender for a convenient date. Make sure the party will not be on a holiday or a day when most people can't make it (i.e Monday!).;
, Or, if you remember the day you adopted, make it an adopt-a-versary!!

,, It could be a little pointless to invite people without dogs.
 You can order special dog birthday invitations or make your own creative ones. Make sure you make enough to send out to everyone you invited. It is also fun to put dog treats on the cards as a surprise for the invited.
 IF YOUR DOG IS AGGRESSIVE, PLEASE LEAVE HIM HOME, BUT YOU ARE WELCOME TO COME!". This is important if you are inviting a friend over who has a dog but you haven't met the dog yet.
 Make sure you have your phone number or email on the invitations for RSVP-ing.

 Vegetable, almond, and baby oil are known to be oils that can remove super glue. If these oils are not immediately available, try other cooking oils such as olive and coconut oil., Use a clean, dry cloth to apply the oil to the affected area. Massage the oil into the affected area. Continue applying oil until you feel the bond of the super glue start to break. Gently pull the skin apart and peel away any remaining glue.








Do not force the glue from your skin. This is dangerous and can cause damage.
 Thoroughly wash your hands with warm water and soap to remove the residual glue and oil. The oil is likely to leave your hands feeling very soft and moisturized.

 Breed standards are the perfect dog specimens for any breed. If you want to breed your dog, this is the goal for the dogs you breed. Breed standards ensure the best health, temperament, working ability, and conformity in the breed., You may love your dog, but that doesnâ€™t mean they should be bred. If you want to breed your dog, you should examine your dog and think about them objectively. Only the best specimens of dogs should be bred.Check each part of the breed standards against your dog. This may include the length of their muzzle, the color of their coat, the shape of their eyes, and the length of their gait.
It is possible to breed your dog with a mate who can balance the flaws, but this should only be done if your dog has minimal flaws.
 Another way to check breed standards is to attend dog shows. Dog shows will display the best dogs of a breed. You can watch other dogs to evaluate what characteristics and behaviors the best of the breed displays.You can compare your dog to the dogs at the dog show. Does your dog compare? Or is it not up to breed standards?

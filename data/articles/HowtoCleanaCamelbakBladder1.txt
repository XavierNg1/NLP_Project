 The water needs to be hot, but not boiling, as this can damage the bladder. Mix the ingredients until they are well combined.For example, if your Camelbak bladder holds 2 liters (8.45 cups) of water, then mix ½ cup (118.3 ml) of baking soda with 1 ½ cups (354.8 ml) of water.
You may also add ¼ cup (59.15 ml) of white vinegar to the solution. If you do, the vinegar will react with the baking soda, making the solution fizz. Wait until the solution stops fizzing before pouring it into the bladder.;
, Then shake it for 30 seconds. Let the solution set for five minutes.If you added vinegar, open the main valve (away from your face) to let any built-up pressure escape.
 This will allow the solution to flow into the tube and mouthpiece. Lay the bladder on its back and let the solution set for 30 minutes. Pour the solution out after 30 minutes.Make sure the hose is facing away from your face when squeezing the bite valve.
 Use a scrub brush or a sponge to clean the bladder. For the tube, use a pipe cleaner-like scrub brush. Scrub away baking soda and other residue from the bladder and tube.You can buy scrub brushes from your local hardware store, or you can purchase the Camelback Cleaning Kit which includes brushes.
 Mix 3/4 teaspoon (3.7 ml) of mild soap with ¾ cup (177 ml) of water per liter volume. Pour the soap solution into the bladder and shake it for 30 seconds. Pinch the bite valve to let the solution flow into the tube. Pour out the solution., Thoroughly rinse the bladder until all traces of soap and the cleaning solution are gone. Drain as much water from the bladder as you can. This will make it easier to dry., Place the bladder and its parts upside down on a rack in your bathroom or kitchen. Or you can place it outside to dry, but do not place it in the sun.Use a Q-tip or another object to prop the bladder open so it can dry completely.

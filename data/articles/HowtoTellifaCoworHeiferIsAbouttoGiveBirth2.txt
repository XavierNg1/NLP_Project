 The first signs of parturition in cows and heifers is that most will start to freshen (or bag up or start lactating) before birth. This may range from 24 hours before birth to even 2 to 3 weeks before birth.


The teats of the cow will start to fill up, looking full and distended, with the teat plugs often starting to come out. Most cows will show these signs 24 hours prior to calving.
 The vulva of the cow or heifer gets quite swollen and large. It also tends to look very loose, with more creases forming along the sides and underneath the vulva than normally.
 The pelvic bones begin to widen out (as a result of the hormone relaxin, as described above), and the tailhead sinks lower into the hooks of the pelvis.
 The first signs of labour occur when the cow usually stops to strain, or may kick at her belly because of the discomfort the contractions are causing her. She will also be laying down and getting up a lot, and be quite fidgety.
 A cow or heifer will usually find a secluded place away from the herd to give birth, whether it's in a grove of trees or in a corner of a corral or pasture.
 After noticing the signs in steps 1 to 3 above, you will also notice a clear mucus discharge from her vulva. This is the onset of the secretions starting in the cervix and vagina to help with reducing friction and aid in an easier birthing process.
 The sides of the cow begin to sink in, and her belly appears to be more larger in the back than it was in the front.
 The water bag is a yellowish-coloured sac that hangs down from the vulva, and is always the first to appear before the calf.
 If the feet are pointing down, then the calf is in normal position. Soon the nose will also start to show.
 The calf is born! Congratulations!

, This "gunk" may stay on the rear of the cow for 6 to 12 hours, until her uterine contractions completely expel it.


This "gunk" is the afterbirth, the remains of the placenta and fetal membranes.

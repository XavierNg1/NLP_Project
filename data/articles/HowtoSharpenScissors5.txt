 This method follows the same principle of using a mason jar to sharpen your scissors, while utilizing a smaller tool.
 Squeeze the scissors closed, and slide the pin out from between the blades as the scissors close. This is the same way you would close the scissors if you were cutting paper or fabric. Use light pressure to close the scissors, let the metal pin do the sharpening work for you.









Repeat this process until the blades have a smooth, clean edge.
 Using a damp paper towel, wipe down the blades of the scissors to clean off any metal bits that may have collected on the blades while cutting the pin.

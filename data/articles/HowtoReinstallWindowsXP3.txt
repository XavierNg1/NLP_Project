 Many computer manufacturers ship their computers with a partition on the hard drive that contains the Windows installation files. In order to access it, you will need to boot into the recovery partition.

The most common key to enter the partition is F11. This will appear underneath the manufacturer log right after starting the computer.






Recovery partition boot sequences vary by manufacturer. Follow the steps on screen to enter the Windows setup program. Once setup has started, follow the steps in the above section starting at Step 3.
 You will need to use a file called winnt32.exe. This file is a Windows installer that can be run from inside Windows XP. To find it, open the Start menu and click Search. Select "all Files and Folders" from the left frame. Enter "winnt32.exe" in the search box.


Running winnt32.exe will reboot your computer into Windows setup. From this point, follow Step 3 in the above section. You will still need to enter a valid product key. Your data will be deleted as it would through a regular install.

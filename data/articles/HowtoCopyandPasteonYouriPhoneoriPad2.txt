 Doing so opens two menus. The one at the bottom of the screen is the "Copy" menu.


The menu that opens immediately above the text bubble allows you to post a quick reaction to the message. The reaction icons are:

Heart (love).
Thumbs up.
Thumbs down.
"HaHa".
"!!".
"?".


To copy from the active text field (where you're currently typing a message), refer to Method 1.
 It's in the menu at the bottom of the screen. This will copy all of the text in the text bubble.
 Locate the place where you'd like to paste the text, whether in a different part of the current document, a new document, or a different app, and tap it with your finger.
 This button will appear above the place where you tapped. The text you copied will be inserted.

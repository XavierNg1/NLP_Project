 You can also make one in Create A Sim Mode. If you make the cat in Create A Sim Mode, give it the Hunter Trait and possibly the Adventurous trait.
 If you have purchased a version of the game where you can control your pet (such as The Sims Pets 3 for PlayStation 3), instead of getting your Sim to teach the cat to hunt, simply click anywhere outside, select the Hunting... interaction and then select the Stalk Something interaction (it will be the only interaction on the list). If you can't control your cat in your version of The Sims Pets 3, just use the Teach To Hunt interaction often (note that if you use it too much your cat will probably get the Brain Hurts moodlet and you will not be able to teach your cat anything for several hours).
 If they did, sell what your cat caught (they will probably catch a beetle). The rarer the thing caught, the more the thing will sell for! As you probably figured, this method is just like the collecting method but it is much more efficient!

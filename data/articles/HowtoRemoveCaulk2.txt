 Soak the abrasive pad in mineral water or mineral spirits before scrubbing with firm, even force along the surface from which the old caulk had been removed.


Rubbing the surface down with mineral spirits strips away any remaining caulk residue. Residue can prevent new caulk from sticking. Moreover, if there is mildew or mold caught in that residue, it poses a health hazard if it is not removed.
 Clean away soap scum by thoroughly scrubbing the surface with a cleaner and sponge.


Do not use ammonia or a cleaner that contains ammonia. You will be using bleach in the next step, and when combined, bleach and ammonia can create toxic fumes.
 Combine 1/3 cup (80 ml) bleach with 1 gallon (4 L) of water until well mixed. Apply this solution to the gap from which the caulk was removed.


Use paintbrush or foam brush too apply the bleach solution.
Let the solution sit on the caulk for about five minutes before disturbing it.
Scrub the bleach away with a toothbrush or firm plastic pad.
 Rinse the area with warm water and pat the surface and the gap with a clean, dry rag.


At this point, you can and should apply new caulk. Make sure that the surface is completely dry before doing so, however, since caulk may not adhere to wet surfaces.

 Make sure it is well patted in and doesn't look oily and disgusting.;
, Apply dabs of it in certain spots where you want your warts.
 This is best if you have a friend or family member to help. If not, apply spirit gum one raisin at a time.
 Make sure the powder is all over the raisins, otherwise it would look like a lump of raisins with unblended cream.
 Hold it there and again blowdry on low heat. Mist it briskly with warm water then unwrap. Remember: Don't vigorously soak your hair in the mist. This is only to keep your hair un-frizzy.
 But you probably won't, right? So put on a dark green shirt and the best would be ombr√®. Then pull over a black loose cardigan. Those kimonos that flow loosely around you are best. Then put on some black jeans or leggings.
 Now if you have long nails you can just paint them black. If you don't you can buy nail extensions and paint those. Halloween is only a day so buy the cheap ones!

, Now this is optional, all you need is many popsicle sticks, and some fluffy green cotton stuff(white cotton balls are fine too). First, stagger popsicle sticks and glue them so they are all joined in a way and are in the same length and width. Then stuff paper in the places you can't fit Popsicle sticks. Make a paste of glue using flour and water. Mix flour and water over low heat on a stove. If you have glue already then mix that with a drop of water. Stir evenly. Coat the mixture on the sticks with a paintbrush so they are all glued down and smoothly joined. That was crumb coat, now do another layer and brush glitter of any color onto it. If you're using cotton balls, briefly pull them apart so they aren't so squished and stiff. Layer these cotton stuff onto the top of the wand to make it look like it's in action of casting a spell.

 Sometimes people with eating disorders experience additional symptoms and warning signs which are not captured by the clinical diagnosis. Control issues are one of these warning signs. Eating disorders are not solely about food, they are sometimes about control.People with eating disorders may experience a sense of lack of control over their eating. Notice if your friend says things like, “I just can’t help myself. I don’t think I can control what I eat.”
On the flip-side, the person may show extreme care and control over his eating. Observe if there is a noticeable preoccupation with weight, calories, or food. Also look for food rituals such as needing to eat a certain way or a certain type of food regularly.
 People who suffer from eating disorders will often have feelings of shame, guilt, depression, and anxiety. Sometimes they may even experience dramatic mood swings.


Does your friend often feel guilty after he eats? He may verbalize his guilt by saying things like, “Ugh, I wish I hadn’t eaten that.”
Identify self-esteem issues such as feelings of worthlessness or inferiority.
 Another common issue in some eating disorders is a disruption in body image. Ask questions and be curious about your friend’s concept of his body.


This may mean that the person is very fearful of gaining weight.
Notice if your friend says he is overweight or fat, when he clearly is not. Denial of low weight can be a symptom of Anorexia.
 Eating disorders can often cause medical complications as well as visible health signs.

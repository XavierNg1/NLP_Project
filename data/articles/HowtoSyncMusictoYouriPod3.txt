 Depending on the version of iTunes you have, it will either appear in the "Devices" section on the left side of iTunes or in the upper right-hand corner of the iTunes window.
 Use the capacity bar at the bottom of the iPod management window to see if you have enough space.
 This will open the music folder on your iPod.
 Underneath that box, there will be options for managing what you sync. To sync only music, check "Entire music library." To sync only select playlists, artists, etc., choose "Selected playlists, artists, albums, and genres." There is also a third option for syncing music videos.
 Do not disconnect your iPod while the iPod is being synced. iTunes will alert you when the sync is complete.
 If you don't want to erase the content on your iPod and start over with a new sync, you can opt to manually manage music on your iPod.


You can also sync only specific content automatically. Do do so, select a content tab such as "Video" and choose automatic syncing.
If you choose to sync only certain content, you will have to set up manual syncing for the rest of your iTunes content.

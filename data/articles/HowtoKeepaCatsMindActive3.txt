 A recent study in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery has shown that using “food puzzles” to nurture cats’ natural hunting behaviors helps alleviate a wide host of mental, emotional, and behavioral issues in indoor cats. These contraptions--usually constructed of plastic or cardboard-- challenge cats to figure out how to get food and treats. Try using these to keep your cat’s mind active!Food puzzles can be purchased at pet stores or online.
Food puzzles can be easily homemade.
Food puzzles come in range of sizes, styles, and levels of difficulty.
 In order to get your cat interested in food puzzles, it is important for them to experience success early on. Start out using simple, see-through food puzzles, and keep them more than half full. It may also help to sprinkle some cat food around the puzzle to pique your cat’s interest, and encourage an association between the puzzle and food.Over time, you will need to increase the difficulty of the puzzles to keep your cat interested.
You can try puzzles with smaller holes or different shapes.
You can place them in more obscure areas of your house.
If your cat is a master, you can try difficult two-part puzzles.
 Although many food puzzle options exists in stores, these games can also be easily constructed at home. All you really need is a container that can contain dry food or treats.


Select a container, such as a shoebox, plastic water bottle, paper towel roll, or egg carton.
Use an X-Acto knife to cut holes into these objects. Either make holes large enough for your cat to insert a paw, or just large enough for food to fall through (particularly with toys that can roll).
Fill the container with food.
Seal any open edges with tape (optional).

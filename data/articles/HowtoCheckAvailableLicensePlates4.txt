 If you ordered your license plate online, it may take a few business days to receive it in the mail. If you ordered your license plate in person, it will also take a few days for you to receive your new plate in the mail.Typically, your new license plate should arrive within 14 days after your order was placed.
 Using a Phillips or flathead screwdriver (depending on which kind of screws were used to initially install the existing license plate), unscrew the screws and pull them out. Set the screws aside so you can reuse them with the new license plate.Once the screws have been removed, the old license plate should simply slide off.
 Line up the pre-drilled holes in the license plate with the holes that the screws will go into. Use your screwdriver to turn the screws clockwise so that they tighten into the drilled holes.Once the screws are completely tight, your new license plate will be ready to go.
Make sure you adhere the expiration sticker to the license plate. You should have received this sticker when you registered for your new license plate.

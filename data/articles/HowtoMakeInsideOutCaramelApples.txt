Look for larger than average apples that are firm to the grasp and have no bruising or damage.
Purchase enough ingredients so you can make more than what the recipe calls for--these sweet delights won’t last long.;
,









Sharp knives to not only cut apple in half but help cut the inside of the apple.
Melon ball scoop to refine and create your well inside the apple.
Saucepan, candy thermometer parchment paper and cookie sheet. You’ll create the caramel sauce in the pan and pour it into waiting apples sitting on a parchment paper laden cookie sheet. Use the candy thermometer to determine the exact temperature while making the caramel sauce.
 Make a clean cut down the middle. You will need to use a very sharp knife.
 Make a few hash marks into the apple flesh (not on the skin).
 Scoop out the middle of the apple, but be careful to leave some flesh near the edges (for a better hold of the caramel).
, While you want the lemon to protect your apple extra juice will interfere not only with the taste but how well the caramel adheres to the apple.
 Combine brown sugar, butter, heavy cream and corn syrup in a Saucepan over high heat.









Stir until brown sugar has dissolved.
Bring mixture to a boil, stirring constantly until a temperature of 230 °F (110 °C) is reached (use your candy thermometer). This process could take up to 7 to 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and add vanilla. Continue stirring until mixture stops bubbling and allow it to cool for up to 15 minutes.










Check apples to ensure they are still a golden color, have not turned brown but are also not carrying excessive lemon juice.
, Work quickly before the caramel sets.
, Serve chilled.

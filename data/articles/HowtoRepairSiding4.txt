 Your safest option is to replace a broken piece of siding rather than trying to repair it. Asbestos becomes a health hazard when small pieces of it become airborne which could happen if you attempt repairs. Intact asbestos siding with no cracks is perfectly safe. There are cement siding pieces available that will be a very close match for your existing siding.
 Put the pieces in doubled contractor bags and dispose of them according to local ordinances.

 If you're up on stage because you've won some kind of award, or otherwise have the attention of a room full of people, you'll want to make sure you thank the necessary parties involved in your success. But also try to remember that you've got a rapt audience who doesn't necessarily want to hear you read an alphabetical list of names they don't recognize. Keep it brief and be humble.
 In a thank-you speech, there might be many people who played integral roles in your success who are there, and some who aren't. If you're pressed for time, make sure you thank the people who are sitting there. Thanking them will feel more significant and emotional.
 If you want to tell a story somehow related to the success you're being recognized for, it can be a great idea. Don't come up with a long-winded story to tell for everybody you're thanking, though. Pick one judiciously and consider telling one that involves more than one person present, so it will be a meaningful and efficient use of your stage time.
 It can be tempting to want to liven things up with attempts at crude humor or by poking fun at other people present. If you're a talented comedian, it might be possible, but it's a much safer bet to use your stage time to be sincere and brief. Your humble thanks will be more entertaining than ironic jokes.


Michael Jordan's Hall of Fame induction speech was widely criticized for being tone deaf and spiteful, talking down to many former opponents and somewhat tarnishing his great legacy. Don't fall in the same trap.

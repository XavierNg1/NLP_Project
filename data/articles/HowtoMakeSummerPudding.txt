 Add half of raspberries to the mixed fruit, pour the fruit mixture into the colander and allow to drain well.;
, Once the fruit is well drained, reserve the juice and transfer the fruit back into its original bowl. Add half of the sugar, stir well and set aside for later.
 Put one slice of bread onto the chopping board and place a ramekin, upside down, on top. Push down hard, to cut out a disk shape, and reserve the left over bread. Repeat until all 6 slices have been cut.
 Unroll the cling film and cut out a large square. Place it into one of the ramekins, pushing it down into the cup and making sure that you have plenty of extra film to overlap the sides. Repeat the process with all the ramekins.
 Slice off the extra left over bits from cutting the disks, and discard them. You are left with large rectangle slices. Dip one side of a bread disk into the reserved fruit juice and place into the ramekin, juice side down.


Take a rectangle, dip one side into the juice, and place the juiced side against the mould of the ramekin. Repeat with another rectangle. Spoon in some of the mixed fruit and push it down.
Take another disk, dip one side into the juice and place on top, juice side up. Just before closing the cling film, give the pudding a final push down, twist to close it and set aside. Repeat exactly the same process with all the remaining ramekins.
 Place all the ramekins onto a tray and transfer to the fridge to chill, for roughly one hour.
 Once chilled untwist the cling film, turn the ramekins upside down and allow the puddings to gently ease out. Decorate the edges of the puddings with the remaining raspberries and place a sprig of mint on top. Finally, dust with some caster sugar and serve.

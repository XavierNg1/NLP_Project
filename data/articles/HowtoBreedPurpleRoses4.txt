 Trying to cross-breed rose bushes to obtain a new variety is not for the faint-hearted. This may be something best left to commercial nurseries that have huge resources at their disposal as it can take many thousands of attempts over many years to obtain a new variety.
 If you want to try creating a new variety of purple roses, you will need to cross-pollinate two ‘parent’ plants. This means taking the pollen from one rose plant and applying it to the stigma of another plant in the hope the two plants will breed together to create an offspring (‘hybrid’) with some of the preferred characteristics of the parents.
 Late spring is the time to cross-pollinate roses. It should be done on a day when rain is not expected. Select two plants you want to try crossing.
 Remove the petals from a bloom on the plant you have chosen to bear the seed of the new hybrid. Remove the anthers from the plant to prevent it from self-pollinating.


Using a paintbrush, remove pollen from one parent and apply to the stigma of the other.
It's a good idea to label the flower you have just pollinated with details of which plant it is crossed with and the date, for your future reference.
 Wait for hips to develop on your cross-pollinated rose bush. After four months harvest the seeds and plant them, using the method in Method 2 above. If you are lucky, these seeds will develop into purple roses.

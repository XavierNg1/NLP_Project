 If you have a conflict with someone, the first step in handling it is to figure out what the conflict is. The conflict may be large and complicated, or it may be a small issue. No matter how big, you should figure out what exactly the conflict is so you can have a clear idea when you handle it.For example, what is the main problem? If you think the conflict is that the other person “doesn’t appreciate me,” then that may be too broad. Try to narrow it down to something more concrete. You may determine that you do more than your share of the cleaning, cooking, and finances and that in the future you'd like to split these duties more evenly.;
, You want to deal with conflict when you both have time to discuss the problem. You should choose a time when neither of you are busy. Make sure you don’t have something to do later that would cut the conversation short.Discuss the conflict in private. Avoid public places, like coffee shops and restaurants. If you live with other people, try to go to a private room or go somewhere where you can be alone.
 You may not want to deal with the conflict because you don’t want to cause any more problems. However, ignoring the conflict may lead to simmering emotions, which can lead to worse feelings in the long run.The longer you ignore conflict, the longer the negative feelings have to fester and build. This is unhealthy and can cause further problems.

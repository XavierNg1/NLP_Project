 Gigantic bubbles have to be strong so that they don't pop. The bubbles solution needs a little extra cornstarch or additional egg white. Mix a large batch of bubbles solution with the following ingredients:


1 cup liquid soap
4 cups water
1/2 cup cornstarch

, In order to create giant bubbles, you'll need a big wand with netting over the opening. This lets the bubble grow large without popping. You can find giant bubble wands in a store, or you can make your own, by following these steps:


Bend a wire coat hanger to form a large circle.






Cover the hole with wire netting, like chicken wire. Using a pair of pliers, bend the netting into place.






You can also use mesh fabric or a piece of netting. Make sure the ends are securely fastened to the wire hole.
 The big wand won't fit into a bottle, so pour the solution into a large, shallow pan. You can use a cookie sheet with high sides or any other shallow dish.
 Lay the wand into the solution so that the hole and netting get completely submerged. Lift the wand slowly and let it trail through the air. You should see a giant, undulating bubble emerge from the wand. Help it separate by continuing to move the wand until the bubble pulls away.


Blowing giant bubbles may take practice. Large bubbles tend to pop more readily than smaller bubbles. Don't give up!
Experiment with putting small objects in the bubbles. Try putting litter, tiny flower petals or another light, small object in the solution and see if you can make it float inside the bubble.

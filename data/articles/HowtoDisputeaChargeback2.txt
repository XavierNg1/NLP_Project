 You can try to resolve the dispute with the customer directly. Keep your communication professional. The customer may be upset about the service he or she received, or you might suspect that the customer is trying to defraud you. Focus on resolving the dispute calmly and respectfully.If your efforts fail, you can still dispute the claim.


Propose a solution, such as a refund, a replacement shipment, etc.
If you reach an agreement, get it in writing. If you reached an agreement via email, save the email messages as a record of the agreement. If you spoke with the customer on the telephone, send the customer a confirmation email confirming the date and time that you spoke, and the resolution you reached.
 If you and the customer come to an agreement and the customer agrees to drop the dispute, he or she must contact the bank that issued the credit card. Otherwise, the bank will not know that the issue has been resolved, and they will proceed with the chargeback., If the customer does not follow through in dropping the dispute, you could still wind up losing the dispute.Respond to the dispute notice by sending a letter and evidence to your bank. In your letter, explain why the dispute arose and how you worked with the customer to resolve it. In your evidence, include:


Emails between you and the customer wherein you came to an agreement to resolve the dispute
Receipts, proof of delivery, documents showing that shipments have been accepted at that address before, etc.

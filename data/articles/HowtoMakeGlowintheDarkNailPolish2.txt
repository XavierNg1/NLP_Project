 Unlike nail polish made from glow sticks, this polish will never lose its glow. You will, however, have to recharge it by letting it sit in the sunlight or under a bright light for a few minutes. The glow will eventually fade, but it can always be recharged. Here is a list of what you will need:


Glow-in-the-dark pigment powder
Clear nail polish (partly full)
Scrap of paper
2 â€“ 3 small ball bearings

, You may be able to find it in a well-supplied arts and crafts store, otherwise, you will have to purchase it online. Try to get a pigment powder that is non-toxic, skin-safe, or meant for cosmetic use. Many artists' pigment powders, meant for mixing into paints, can be toxic., They will help the pigment mix better into the polish.
 It is very fine, so be careful not to inhale it. You will need abut 1 teaspoon of the powder.The more powder you use, the more opaque the polish will be; the less powder you use, the more sheer the polish will be. There are several ways in which you can pour it into the bottle:









Make a small funnel by rolling a scrap of paper into a cone. Sticky the pointy end down the neck of the nail polish bottle, and pour the powder into the bottle.
If the powder comes in a bag, and you already know how much the bag contains, you can snip one of the corners off the bag. Stick the cut corner into the mouth of the bottle and jiggle the bag until the powder is inside the bottle.
 Keep shaking it for a few minutes until the powder is mixed throughout the polish and there are no streaks. You may hear the ball bearings rattle inside; they are helping the polish and pigment mix together.
 You can paint them using just the glow-in-the-dark nail polish, or you can paint them with a regular polish first, and use the glowing one as a top coat.
 This will protect your nail polish against chips.

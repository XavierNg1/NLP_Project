 Talk to voters to find out what they care about in this election. Are they concerned with big questions about the quality of the incumbent's leadership, or are they just worried about getting their tax bill lower. Learn everything you can about these issues, and develop considered but strong stances. Don't just run for election because you want to win—you need to care about the issues that are at stake.;
, Elections aren't solitaire: you have to consider the other candidates and figure out how to outwit their campaign and dissuade people from voting for them. Find out everything there is to know about your main competitors. Try to distinguish yourself from them on key issues and play up any weaknesses or scandals they might be trying to hide.
 Not everyone is going to like or vote for you, but nor is every voter going to be a tough sell. Find the core groups and demographics that are excited to vote for you, and reach out to them early. These supporters are vital to organizing volunteers and raising campaign funds. You don't have to spend a lot of time convincing these people, but don't neglect them too much—a candidate that alienates his or her base is almost always done for.
 Undecided voters might infuriate the politically savvy, but they still make or break every election. Learn what they care about and what factors or policies could earn you their votes—then market to them aggressively. After building and organizing your base, winning over voters that are on the fence or that you can steal from your opponents is the main mission of your campaign.
 It's rare that the first campaign strategy you try will work perfectly. Conduct polls of voters to find out how you are doing and adjust your campaign accordingly. Be sure to break down your poll samples by demographic and how likely they are to actually vote.

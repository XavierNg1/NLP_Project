 To start, brush out your hair. Then, use a comb and brush to make a side part. Make the side part at whichever angle is most flattering with your face.If you're unsure which side part works best, try taking a selfie with the part on one side and then the other and then compare.
 Take a fine-toothed comb and run it from your part to the front of your ear. Clip back the hair that falls in front of this diagonal line., Use a brush or comb to gently back comb all of your loose hair. This will add some volume. After your hair gets a little frizzy from back combing, brush it out. This way, your hair will be a little bigger but not too ratty., Pull all your hair that's hanging down into a ponytail. Keep the ponytail fairly high on your neck for a '50s style., Remove the clips from the hair you sectioned off first. Part this hair in half., Take one side of the front part of your hair. Wrap it around whatever is holding your ponytail in place. If necessary, use bobby pins to secure your hair around the ponytail., Take the remaining hair that's hanging down. Wrap it around your ponytail as well. Secure with bobby pins if necessary., Take a heated hair curler. Use this to curl your pony tail one strand at a time. You can separate your hair into as many curls as you want. More strands will make for a curlier look. When you're done, you should have a neat, curly ponytail with a slight bob on the front of your head.It's a good idea to apply a heat protectant before curling your hair.

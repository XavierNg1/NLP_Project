 This can be found on some cardboard boxes, especially on the flaps. Or, it can be purchased from a craft store.
 Draw freehand or use a template from online.
 Use strong paper cutting scissors, to help you cut through the thicker layer of cardboard.
 If the cardboard isn't a color you'd like the tree to be, color in the whole tree first. Then add detail colored parts, such as a singing bird, a bird's nest, leaves, blossom, fruit, etc.


Consider gluing on cutouts such as apples, pears, oranges, etc. You can even add things such as buttons, ribbon, scrapbooking elements, etc.
 This is optional but can be useful for if you want to display the tree in a classroom or your own room. Simply cut an elongated triangle from cardboard. Bend the wide end of the triangle back a little. Attach the bent part to the back of the tree, at the base. Have the rest of the length of the triangle sitting on the table or shelf, holding up the tree.

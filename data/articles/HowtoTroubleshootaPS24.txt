 The disk might have specs of dust on it that is stopping the console from reading it correctly. It might also have fingerprints and general dirt on it. By cleaning the disk, you might be saving it from being thrown away into the dustbin. Try to keep the disk in its case at all time to avoid this happening. Oh, and don't touch the bottom of it!

, This can help determine what exactly is the problem. If the other game is working but the one that you want to play is not, you know that the disk is the problem. If both the games are not functioning as they should be, the console might be permanently damaged. This is more unlikely than the disk being the issue but it means that the console is now useless.
 These types of disks are very easy to find. They are designed to clean the small eye that reads your game disks. Simply put them into your Ps2 and let it run. They shouldn't run for more than half an hour but if that's how long the disk is, let it finish running. After you've used this cleaner disk, try playing your game. If it's still not working, something might be wrong with the actual console, not just the eye.

 Windows XP users will need to ensure they have service pack 3 installed before attempting to download updates. Note that service packs 1 and 2 must be installed prior to installing service pack 3.


Go to the Start menu, click on "Control Panel" and select the "Classic View" option on the upper-left side of your screen. Locate and click on the "Automatic Updates" icon in the control panel folder.
Click on the circle labeled "Automatic," or click on the underlined link near the bottom of the window to be redirected to the Microsoft XP update webpage. Follow the instructions from Microsoft to ensure you have the latest updates available.

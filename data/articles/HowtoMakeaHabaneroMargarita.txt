 Slice little strips about 1cm (1/2") thick, the length of the habanero.;
, Put the cap back on. Place in fridge for 24-48 hours.


This process is called 'infusing the liquor'. If you have time, it's best to wait about 4-5 days.
If you don't have time to infuse the Tequila, you can muddle the Habanero in the mixing tin before you add it to the iced drink. To muddle: Place a few pieces of the habanero in the mixing tin, using a muddler or a something blunt like bottom of spoon, smash the habanero with the tequila to release the oils and juices. A little muddling goes a long way.
 (If you're brave, try eating one––actually, by this point you'll discover that the habanero is pretty much drained of the oils that make it hot so they're not too bad to eat or use as a garnish.)

,, Add 1/3 less triple sec than tequila. Triple sec is your sweetener for the drink––less triple sec means a less sweet drink––it’s about a 1/3 ratio to 2/3 tequila at half full glass.
 Make sure they are very juicy and fresh. Next, squeeze a full lime into the margarita glass. Throw the used lime halves in with the margarita.


If adding the whole lime (rind and flesh) to the margarita, be sure to clean the lime prior to cutting. You never know who handled it before you bought it or what's lurking on the peel.
 Not to much; just enough to slightly change the color.


If you like your margaritas sweet, add agave nectar or simple syrup to taste.
 Put the top on and shake with both hands, keeping a tight seal. Do this until the mixing tin feels cold to the touch, usually about 5-10 seconds.


The lime should be bruising with this process, which will help give a tart taste to the drink.
 If you want to add salt to the glass, make sure you do this before adding the contents of the mixing tin. Salt should be 'coarse' grade, not table salt.

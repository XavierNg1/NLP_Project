 Static clings are made from plasticized vinyl that will stick to smooth surfaces without sticky adhesives. They won’t leave a residue when they are removed. This type of decal will stick to glass or plastic.
 Before applying the cling, you need to clean the area of the window where you want to place it. Use window cleaner with ammonia on windows before using a static cling.After cleaning it, make sure to dry the area. A static cling won’t stick to a wet or damp surface.
 The dry method can be used for small decals that are smaller than 12 inches (31 cm). Place the decal where you want it on the window. Using a rubber roller, push out the trapped air. Start in the center and work outwards.
 Large decals that are over 12 inches (31 cm) stick better if you use a solution to help them stick. Mix two teaspoons (10 mL) of liquid household detergent with one gallon (4 L) of cold water. Cover the side of the decal that you will stick to the window with the solution.








You can pour the solution on the decal or use a spray bottle.
 Press the decal against the window. When you have the decal where you want it, press the water out from under the decal. Use a squeegee or a rubber roller. Start in the center and press outwards. Push down the edges to make sure it sticks to the window.








Wipe away moisture with paper towels.

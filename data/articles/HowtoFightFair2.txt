 Have the discussion in private without unwanted or uninvolved participants. Avoid distractions like computers and phones, so you can each turn your attention towards the conversation at hand. Have the discussion at a mutually convenient time, so each participant can reflect on what they’d like to discuss prior to the meeting.
 Making a conscious decision among all involved participants to abide by a set of ground rules will ensure a productive conversation to resolve conflict or advocate for a certain perspective. Ground rules might include:


Maintain professionalism in manner and language.
Stay on topic.
Do not threaten other participants.
Do not attack other participants on a personal level.
 Determine the points that you can agree on before launching into fights about what you don’t agree on. This will enable a clearer route to resolution because you recognize that there is something positive to build upon.
 While workplaces often do not appreciate the emotional investment associated with certain projects or other aspects of one’s professional life, it is important to acknowledge the existence of that emotion. Demonstrate respect to your colleagues (or manager or subordinate) that you understand they have an emotional investment in their work. This will also serve to move the conversation back to solid ground.
 Allow your opponent to express their perspective fully. Wait a few seconds before responding so that you fully understand what they’re saying.
 Unproductive, combative conversations in which the same points are argued over and over should be set aside for a day or two before resuming discussions.
 If it seems like the conversation is degenerating into unproductive, unfair fighting, it may be necessary to bring in a third party to keep the dialogue on track.

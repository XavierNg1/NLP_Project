 An emoticon is an icon used to represent an emotion.
 Look up the character codes online. For example, holding the Alt button while typing the number 074 on a numeric keypad will result in a smiling face emoticon, while typing the number 076 while holding down the Alt button will result in a sad-faced emoticon.

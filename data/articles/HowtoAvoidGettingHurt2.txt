 Relax and prepare to break your fall.
 Slowly but swiftly, turn your body in a motion that will prevent you from falling on your neck or back. Tuck your chin into your chest and keep your arms close to your body. Bend your knees. Landing on your back is actually a fairly safe way to fall, as it's rare to break your back if you fall on it flat, but it hurts and will knock the wind out of you, making it hard to breathe for a few minutes.

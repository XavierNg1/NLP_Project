 The drafting table is the most important part of the drafter's tool kit. Look for a table with a height-adjustable tabletop, and one that allows you to adjust the angle of the work surface. Built-in storage boxes are an option on many tables. Some drafting tables have collapsible legs for transport, but these are not typically as sturdy as their permanent counterparts. As an inexpensive alternative to a full drafting table, you can purchase just a work surface that is designed to be used on top of another table.;
, The T-square is a very important drafting tool, allowing you to create straight horizontal and vertical lines, as well as providing a datum for the use of drafting triangles. Look for a T-square with a blade length that is nearly as long as your table; because the T-square head rests against the edge of the tabletop, a short T-square will not be able to extend far enough into the work surface to be useful. Also, select a T-square with transparent blade edges; this allows you to see your work clearly.
 For drafting, you will need a variety of different pencil weights. Pencils are graded on a scale from "9H" (the hardest) to "9B" (the blackest), with the grade "HB" occupying the middle of the spectrum. Hard pencils (those with an "H" designation) create fine, lightweight lines that are perfect for construction lines, while black pencils (those designated with a "B") create heavy lines ideal for finishing a drawing. An ideal beginner's set of drafting pencils would include: 4H, 2H, HB, 2B, and 4B leads. Purchase pens only if you plan on inking your drawings after constructing them.


In the United States, a scale is sometimes used that grades pencil weights using a numerical system (whereby a "#2" pencil is equal to an "HB" pencil). This scale is not likely to used by art or architectural supply stores, however.
 A drafting triangle sits against your T-square and allows you to create straight lines at different angles. Drafting triangles come in a variety of shapes and sizes. To begin with, it is a good idea to purchase 3 triangles: a 45-degree triangle, a 30-60-degree triangle, and an adjustable triangle. If you will be using the triangles as straightedges against which to make cuts, buy aluminum triangles ï¿½ plastic ones will get nicked by your blade.
 There are several other small items which are very helpful when drafting.


Drafting dots are small adhesive pads that keep your drawing in place as you work.
A cleaning pad (also known as a pounce sock) allows you to cover your drawing in tiny particles that act as ball bearings so that your T-square and triangles do not create smudges.
A drafting brush allows you to manage the amount of pounce on your drawing.
A rotary lead pointer is a specially-designed pencil sharpener that is ideal for drafting pencils.
An architect's or engineer's scale is also essential. This is a straightedge that has different scale markings along the side, allowing you to draw plans and elevations to a certain scale.

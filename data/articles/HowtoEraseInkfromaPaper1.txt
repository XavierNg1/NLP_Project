 Most nail polish remover is made of acetone, and this can be used to remove ink from paper. Apply a small amount of acetone to a cotton swab, and rub into the ink you're trying to erase.This works best on regular ballpoint pen ink.
Blue ink is more easily erased than black ink.;
, You can apply isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol to any paper you're trying to erase the ink from. If you only have a small amount of ink to erase, use a cotton swab. If you want to erase most of the ink from a page, soak the paper in a small washing tray for 5 minutes.Any brand of isopropyl alcohol works for this method. Avoid any rubbing alcohol that contains scents or dyes.
Make sure you cover any area of the paper you don't want to erase.
 Pour a small amount of lemon juice into an 8-oz jar. Dip a cotton swab into the lemon juice. Then, wipe the wet cotton gently across the inked paper you're trying to erase.The acid will dissolve the ink, but it also dissolves the paper. Be gentle, especially when erasing ink from fine paper.
Heavy-weight paper will stand up to pen erasure more readily than light-weight paper.
 Mix it up in a small glass bowl for best results. Use a clean, white cotton cloth to dab your baking soda paste onto the inked paper. Gently rub the paste into the ink you'd like to erase.You might find an old toothbrush useful to carry the paste from the bowl to the page, or to rub it onto the ink. This works best if your toothbrush bristles are still relatively intact, not too frayed.
Allow the paper to dry well. There's no need to rinse the baking soda off. The water will evaporate, and the baking soda will simply fall off the page.

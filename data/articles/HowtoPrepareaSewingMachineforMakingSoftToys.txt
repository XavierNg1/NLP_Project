 Unlike the normal clothes sewing process, sewing soft toys often requires the sewing of layers using fabric that can be quite thick, such as fur, felt, corduroy or thick cotton.;
, This will help it to cope with the additional strain.
 Do your stitching more slowly when sewing through thicker fabric or through felt. This will help to ensure that the strain on the machine is less and that you don't end up with bunched up fabric clogging the needles.

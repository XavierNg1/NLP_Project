 If your border collie lowers her head and front legs, as well as her tail, she is getting into her herding stance. This stance is part of her natural instinct for herding. If you see her drop into this stance, it's because she wants to herd whatever it is she's concentrating on, from cats to cars., Border collies need a great deal of stimulation, so be sure to give your dog plenty of exercise to keep her happy., A border collie usually has two types of growls, one serious and one play. You need to learn the difference so you don't upset your dog when she's being serious. Listen for play growls when she's playing tug-of-war, and learn to differentiate the sound from her more serious growl.Learning these two growls will also help if you choose to train your border collie on sheep, as you'll be able to tell when she is growling at the sheep in earnest.
 Your border collie was bred to help out shepherds by herding animals. That means that she wants a job to do. If you can give her a space to herd, that's great. If you don't have room for other animals, you may consider recreational herding, which is a form of dog sport.Other "jobs" you can give your border collie involve providing her with a digging hole (out of the way) or allowing her to "herd" cats under your direction. Use her bad behaviors, such as digging holes in the yard or chasing cats, and turn them into something controlled.

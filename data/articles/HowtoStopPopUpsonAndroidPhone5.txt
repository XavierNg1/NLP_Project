 Most apps on the Play Store are free versions, having limited features compared to its full version, as well as having ads popping up every now and then or occupying a portion of the screen. If there’s a full version available in the Play Store, buy and download that one instead.
 Some apps might not have full versions available in the Play Store for you to purchase and download. Instead, they will have a “Remove ads” option inside the app for you to select and buy.


To locate the option, you might either see a “Remove ad” link right on the ad or you can go to the app’s settings menu and find it there. Tapping the option will open the Google Wallet for you to begin processing your purchase. Cost of removing the ads vary from one app to another.
There are some apps that have full versions in the Play Store as well as the “Remove ads” option in the app. If this is the case for your app, it would be best to purchase the full version from the Play Store, so when you change phones, you can still download the same paid app but this time for free (it’s a one-time purchase). If you purchase Remove Ads from inside the app, Play Store may register it as an in-app purchase, and the information might not carry over to a new device; you might end up downloading the free version in the new device, but it will still contain ads despite purchasing the Remove Ads option from the old device.
 In some apps, pop-ups may appear due to improper installation of the app. Try re-installing the app from the Play Store. If the problem persists, it might not be possible to stop pop-ups from it. If the pop-ups really bother you, just uninstall the app or contact the app developer.

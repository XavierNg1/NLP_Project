 This will call all the contacts added to the conversation. Wait until everyone is on Skype to proceed with watching the movie.
 You can also try a website like Netflix or something like it to watch a movie, but it might be a lot for an average desktop computer to stream that much at once. Turn your sound up high and make sure everyone can hear it. You can also connect a microphone to your computer and put it by your speaker to improve the sound quality.


If you want a more ideal sound experience you can spend some extra money to purchase a better hardware solution.It will cost about $30 or $40 but will give you much better sound for your movie party.
To improve sound with additional hardware you will need an audio splitter that goes from a single 3.5mm male connector to two 3.5mm female connectors. You will also need two RCA to 3.5mm headphone connectors. Finally, you will need a mixing board, some headphones and a microphone.
Take the splitter with two female 3.5mm connectors and insert the single 3.5mm male connector into headphone output on the computer. Attach the headphones to one female connector and attach one of the 3.5mm to RCA connectors from the other line to input the mixing board. Plug your microphone into the mixing board as well. Connect the last RCA connector to the output of the mixing board and connect it to the auxiliary audio input on your computer.
Use the mixers on the board to control the sound.
 Start playing the movie and you can adjust the size in your window so that everyone can see it.
 Just like a real movie party, you can talk about the movie as it's playing, or pause the movie and just chat. This method is great if you plan on stopping the movie a lot to catch up.

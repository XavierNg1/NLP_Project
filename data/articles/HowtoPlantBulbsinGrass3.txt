 This method works for all bulbs. You can use a bulb planter to make a hole in the sod, drop the bulb into the hole and pop the sod out of the bulb planter to cover the bulb.


The bulbs should be planted two to three times as deep as the bulb’s width. Water the newly-planted bulbs until the soil is moist to a depth of 6 inches (15.2 cm).
 In particular, crocus and daffodil bulbs can be planted using the “free form” method. Simply use a dirt shovel or small hand shovel to open a wedge in the ground and drop the bulb into the wedge with the pointed end up.


They will grow their roots into the soil and be covered naturally with leaves and other debris over the fall and winter.
 Give the bulbs fertilizer when they begin to grow leaves. Usually, ½ to 1 pound of fertilizer is sufficient for 50 square feet of planted area but this varies, depending on the fertilizer formula.


A balanced 10-10-10 or 5-10-10 fertilizer works well for bulbs.
 Water them often enough to keep the soil uniformly moist until after they stop blooming. Spring bulbs do not need supplemental water in most areas.


On the other hand, summer and fall bulbs will need to be watered regularly.

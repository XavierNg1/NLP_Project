 How much ice you use will depend on the size of your cooler, bucket, or sink. Try to make sure you have enough ice to bury the bottles or cans underneath it. If you have a lot of beer you may need to use more than one cooler or bucket or chill the beer in shifts.
 Make sure that you add enough water that the mixture is soupy. As a liquid, water can cover a can or bottle at more points than ice can, which will allow it to cool faster.However, water will also warm at a faster speed, so make sure you add more ice as it melts. This will require you to dump some of the water out each time you add ice.
 Salt will help cool your beer faster because it allows water to drop to a temperature below freezing without becoming a solid. This means that you get the benefit of the cold temperature of the ice while still having the surface exposure of the water. You should try to have 1 cup of salt for every 3 lbs of ice.Ice will melt faster because of the salt, so be sure to replenish the ice frequently. , Since the water is “super cool” be careful of touching it too much with your hands. Instead, try gently dropping the beer into your cooler, sink, or bucket. You should also make sure that each can or bottle has enough space to be moved around.
 Moving the beer around will help ensure that all the liquid inside gets equal exposure to the surrounding ice, which will, in turn, help it cool faster. You should make sure you move the bottles or cans every couple of minutes.


Once you’ve added the beer it should cool in 2-5 minutes.

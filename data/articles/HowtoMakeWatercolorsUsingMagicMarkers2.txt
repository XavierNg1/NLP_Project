 Count the number of color groupings that you have for the ink inserts, and arrange an equal number of plastic cups or glass jars on your work surface. Depending on how much watercolor paint you want to make, fill each container ½ to ¾ of the way full.You can use plain tap water for the watercolors.
 To make it easier to soak the inserts, it helps to secure them in a single bundle. Use rubber bands or pieces of string to keep all of the matching color inserts together.If you prefer, you can use a pair of scissors to cut the inserts into several pieces to make it easier to fit them in your containers.
 When the inserts are all secured together, place them inside the containers with the water. Allow them to soak for 24 hours to a week to allow all of the ink to leach out of the inserts.Be sure to keep the containers that you’re soaking the inserts in out of the way of children and pets so they aren’t accidentally knocked over.
 When the inserts have soaked for at least a day and the water has been colored, lift the inserts out of the water. Squeeze them to push any remaining ink out of them and into the water before discarding them.Wrap plastic wrap or paper towel around the inserts when you’re squeezing them to avoid getting ink on your fingers.

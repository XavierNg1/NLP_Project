 If you live close enough to your neighbors that you can see their wireless connections, it’s possible that your wireless device is being bogged down by having to broadcast on the same channel as them. To test this, download, install, and run a program like inSSIDer to scan wireless networks and their associated channels in your vicinity.


Find your wireless connection in the list (usually at the top). Look for the channel it broadcasts on, then compare this to the other channels being used. Ideally, it will be the only network on this channel (as in the example below), but this often isn't the case. (In fact, in crowded areas, this may not be even be possible.) Scout for a channel between 1 and 11 with few or no networks and make note of channels that are overburdened with many, many networks (in the example below, channel 6).
If necessary, change your wireless channel. Connect to your modem/router’s IP address (find the manual, check on the device itself, or look it up online), look for the broadcast channel among the settings (the location will vary depending on your device), and select an alternative from the drop-down list.
 Either move it to the room where it will get the most use of position it centrally. Ideally, there should be a direct, unobstructed line between your computer and router.
 In particular, cordless phones can be a real nuisance for your wireless internet connection, so if the two devices share a phone jack, space them as far apart as physically possible (or at least leave a few feet between them).
 Going wireless is liberating, but the tradeoff is signal interference, especially when it’s traveling through walls, and reduced overall performance. Make an Ethernet cable your first choice when connecting and save wireless for when you really need to do that Aaron-Sorkin-style walk and talk through the building.
 An old modem/router may not be physically capable of accommodating the speed potential of your internet package.

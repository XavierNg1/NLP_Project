 If you prefer to register by mail, you can get a mail packet at your school’s guidance, career or college office. If your counselor doesn't have any, you are home schooled, or you otherwise do not have access to school resources, you can request a packet online by going to http://forms.act.org/student/stud_req.html.


You must register by mail if you don’t have a credit card or a fee waiver, or if you are younger than 13.International students must register online., The information requested by the register-by-mail packet is the same information requested by the online registration option. You will be asked about your high school classes and grades, about your career interests, and about your college plans. You will also be asked to choose a test center and date.


You will need to supply a recent photo of your head and shoulders. You can include a printed photo with your registration, or you can go online to upload one to your account if you have an ACT web account.
 Be sure to allow 7–10 days for delivery. The packet must be received by the deadline date to avoid late registration fees.


You will receive your test ticket in the mail. You can also go onto your ACT web account and print a ticket, the same way someone who registers online does.
 Even though you are registering by mail, you will want to create an online account at www.act.org to check your scores. You will also be able to upload your photo.

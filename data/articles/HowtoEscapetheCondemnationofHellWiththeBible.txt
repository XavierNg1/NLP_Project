,, "Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. And whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come" (Matthew 12:22-32)". It is when a person denies the holy spirit to the point that their heart is hardened, that he can no longer hear the holy spirit. When the holy spirit talks to you and you cannot hear him because you rejected him to the point your heart is hardened, the holy spirit will leave you forever. Don't deny the holy spirit. Also, those that fear that they did commit blasphemy against holy spirit have not done so.

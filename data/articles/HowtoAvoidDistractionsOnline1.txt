 Extensions are applications you can download and install on a web browser, like Chrome or Firefox, and many of them offer tools to help cut down on distractions.


Extensions such as RescueTime and Time Tracker (both available for Chrome and Firefox) will record and tell you how much time you spend on different websites, so you can identify your problem sites. Similar applications are available for other browsers, such as Safari.
Common time-sucker sites to watch out for include social media (Facebook, Twitter), news sites, blogs, and online games.;
, There are many different apps and extensions available, depending on your device and browser, that can help you stay on track.


Popular browser extensions include StayFocusd (Chrome), LeechBlock (Firefox), and KeepMeOut (all browsers).
Make sure not to block important sites. Carefully follow the instructions for your extension and ensure that you’re not blocking websites you might need access to, such as your email or bank account.
 Sometimes the most distracting part of being online is the pings and pop-ups displayed to show activity on your online accounts. Turning off notifications will disconnect you from those sites when you’re not using them.


On Facebook, click Settings in the top right corner and choose Account settings, then the Notifications to disable email notifications.
On Twitter, click the profile icon, select Settings, and click on Email Notifications., Cell phones connected to the Internet are tempting sources of distraction. Turning your phone off or on silent and putting it out of your line of sight eliminates the temptation to check social media or texts.

On iPhones, use the “Do Not Disturb” mode by swiping up on the screen, then pressing the moon button. This keeps the phone on, but silences the ringer and vibrations.

 There’s really no need to spend much money on office accessories, if any at all. Look around your house for items like framed photographs, houseplants, and knickknacks to add some personality to your workspace without spending money.Given a little time, you’ll probably accumulate more accessories than you need. You might receive a gift like a stress ball or Zen garden to place in your office on your next birthday or holiday. If you have kids, they might make you something in school you can put on your desk.
 Instead of spending hundreds on office art, you can paint your office’s walls a bright color, and create a focal wall using painter’s tape to make stripes or by putting up wall decals. Consider designating a large wall area as a blackboard brainstorming area, using inexpensive chalkboard paint to create it.Affordable wall decor options also include your diploma or certificates. You can also print out and frame inspirational quotes or sayings.
Check out secondhand stores for inexpensive framed art or prints that match your taste.
 To improve both efficiency and aesthetics, you’ll need lighting options other than the room’s overhead light. However, you don’t have to break your bank by purchasing top of the line lighting accessories.For your desk, consider reusing a small lamp from elsewhere in your home.
Look around consignment shops or home decor or department stores’ clearance sections for reduced-price floor and desk lamps.  
Try to provide two to three lighting accessories so you can customize the room’s light levels. Including more lighting options is better for your eyes and improves the room’s feel. Warmer, shaded sources of light like desk and floor lamps are preferable to fluorescent overhead lighting.

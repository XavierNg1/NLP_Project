 In most cases, the color paint code in Ford vehicles is located on the driver's side front door panel. If you open your door and look along the side of the door, towards the bottom you should see a manufacturer's label. This will contain the color code., The majority of Fords will have the manufacture's label on the front door panel. However, it may be on the front door lock pillar. Open the car door on the driver's side. Look at the small ridge inside the car, usually blocked when the door is closed. The manufacturer's label may be towards the bottom of this ridge., Once you've found the manufacturer's label, you can use this to locate the color code. The color code is found below the bar code and marked by two digits, which can be either numbers or letters. The two digits are listed above or next to the words "exterior paint colors." For example, if you saw the letters "PM" written above "exterior paint colors" this would mean the color code is PM.

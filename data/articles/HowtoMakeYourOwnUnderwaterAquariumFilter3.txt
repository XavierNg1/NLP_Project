 The neck of the bottle should fit right over the intake valve of the powerhead. Remember to choose the right powerhead for your tank; it should pump twice as much water as what's in your tank per hour.


The more powerful your powerhead is, the larger bottle you will need.
Bottle filters are great for large tanks.
 Cut about two-thirds of the bottom corner out, but leave part of the base intake, or your filter media will fall out. This is where the water will come in and out of.
 You can find filter floss in your pet store or in a fish tank store. Try to pack the floss into the bottle, so that it is dense. The filter floss will catch debris.
 About 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) should be enough.The charcoal will filter out bacteria and toxins.
 Remember to pack the filter media somewhat, so that it is snug. The will help filter out the biggest pieces of debris.
 This is not necessary for all tanks, but if you have shrimp, small fish, or delicate fish, this would be a very good idea. Simply wrap some mesh over the hole, and secure it with string. Women's hose are great for this., The intake valve will suck the dirty water into the bottle. The filter media inside will clear all of the dirt out.
 A 3 inch (7.62 centimeters) long piece will be enough. The clean water will come out of this tube.
 If the powerhead has suction cups, use them to attach it to the wall of your tank. Angle the airline tubing towards the surface of the water.

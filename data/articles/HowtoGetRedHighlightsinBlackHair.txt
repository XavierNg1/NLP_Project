 The best way to do this is to part your hair into sections, and isolate the parts of hair you would like to be a different colour. You can do this with tying up these sections of hair with hair bands or hair clip. Just make sure they keep away from the rest of your hair, just in case the bleach splashes onto the other parts of your hair and you have random lighter sections later on.;
, If your hair is dyed darker, start with the bottom half of your hair and work up into your roots, as this section will not need so much bleach. Not only that, if you apply the bleach to the lighter sections of your hair for too long than the time specified on the packet, you could really damage or dry out your hair. Make sure you use a dye brush, as this really allows you to get to the roots of your hair.
 If you are unsure what this might be, have a look at the back of a bleach packet. There should be a chart that corresponds with how much time you should leave the bleach on in comparison to your hair colour.
 Make sure you give your hairline a good wash, as well as the areas around where your hair begins - such as the back of your neck and ears. These areas can be very sensitive, and leaving peroxide on them for too long can cause visible burn marks.
 It is strongly recommended that you wear gloves for this, unless you want to walk around for the next few days looking like you've murdered someone!


Make sure you apply a generous amount of dye to each section of your hair and that you really work it into the separate strands, and roots, if need be. This will give you a stronger, more long-lasting colour.
 This gives time for the colour to properly soak into your hair.
 Towel or blow dry if necessary and voila - you now have what will be black and red hair!

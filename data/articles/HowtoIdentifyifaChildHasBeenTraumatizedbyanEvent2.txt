 Compare how the child acts now to how the child acted before the trauma. If you see extreme behavior, or a noticeable change from their normal behavior, then something is probably wrong.


A child may seem to develop a new personality (e.g. a confident girl turning into a shaky people-pleaser overnight), or may switch between several strong moods (e.g. a boy who flip flops between withdrawn and aggressive).
 A traumatized child may cry and whine over relatively small things that wouldn't have bothered them so much before.
 The child may revert to younger behavior, such as thumb-sucking and wetting the bed. This is especially common in cases of sexual abuse and compliance therapies for autism, but can be seen in other forms of trauma as well.
 Traumatized children, especially those harmed by an adult, may attempt to appease adults or avoid angering them. You may notice avoidance of attention, complete compliance, and/or overachieving to turn into a "perfect" child.
 Traumatized children may act out, become frustrated easily, and start throwing more temper tantrums. They may even become aggressive towards others.
 These symptoms may worsen when the child must do something related to the trauma (e.g. going to school after abuse at school), or when the child is stressed.

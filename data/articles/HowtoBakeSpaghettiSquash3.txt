 Pull out a 9- by 13-inch (23- by 33-cm) baking dish and set aside until ready to use.
 Use a serrated knife to cut the squash in half from top to bottom. Dig out the seeds and stringy pulp with a metal spoon or ice cream scoop.


Use a sawing motion to cut through the thick uncooked skin of the spaghetti squash.
 Use a fork or spoon to thoroughly mix the brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and pepper inside one hollowed-out half of the squash. Add 3 Tbsp (45 ml) of butter over the spice mix in even dollops.


The salt and pepper should be added according to taste, but a dash of each should suffice for most.
 Toss the Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper in the other hollowed-out half. Add the remaining 3 Tbsp (45 ml) butter over the cheese mix in even dollops.


Use a dash each of salt and pepper, or more as desired.
 Position the spaghetti squash halves side-by-side in your baking dish. Pour the vegetable broth over both halves, allowing it to drip off into the sides of the pan.


The halves must be in a single layer. They can touch, but they cannot overlap.
 Cover the baking pan with aluminum foil and bake in your preheated oven until tender.


Cover the pan loosely so that spaghetti squash is able to vent.
Test the tenderness of the squash by sticking a fork into the exposed portion of the flesh. It should immediately begin to flake into strands.
 Use two forks to scrape the flesh into "spaghetti" strands. Toss the strands gently inside the shell once separated.


You may need to let the spaghetti squash rest 5 to 10 minutes before handling.
 Drizzle the "sweet" half with honey and sprinkle the remaining Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning over the "savory" half. Serve warm.


Do not combine the halves. Serve the sweet "spaghetti" directly from one half and the savory "spaghetti" directly from the other half.

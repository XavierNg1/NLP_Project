 The jury is still out. More people win via quick picks (in Powerball)-- but more people use quick picks. Statistically, the odds are the same that any combination of numbers will be picked. So, it doesnâ€™t matter if you choose lucky numbers or let the machine choose for you.Though it may seem illogical, 1-2-3-4-5-6 is just as likely as a random selection of 6 numbers.
The only drawback of self picks is that humans are all generally programmed the same. That is, your favorite numbers are probably someone else's favorite numbers. So, if you win on 7-14-21-28-35-42, you may have to share.
Richard Lustig, 7-time lottery winner, highly advises against quick picks.He argues that picking your own numbers keeps you from getting combinations of recent winners (so long as you've done your research!), thus increasing your chances..

If you are playing your state's lottery, don't bother checking to see if old winning numbers are available online. Just because a number recently came up, that doesn't alter the odds of it coming up again. Today's randomly selected numbers aren't affected by any other day's randomly selected number.

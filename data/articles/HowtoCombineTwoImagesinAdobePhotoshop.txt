 Here's the Path to follow. File-->New. Give the values of the resolution exactly how much you require. I have chosen the values 800x600 Height and Width.;
, A new pop up window would be open then select the file you want to combine with the other one.
 You can reduce the size of the image and adjust anywhere you want to place with just use drag and drop from mouse cursor. Once you exactly place your image where you want to place then do a right click and select the option PLACE image would be place and the adjustment box would be remove or if you want to cancel the image at this time then click CANCEL image would be remove.
 Repeat step 2 again to place the second image and once you choose the second image then adjust that second image with mouse courser as you have done in step three for your first image.
 now both of images has been placed on one canvas.
 A new window would be pop and ask you the format you want to save and some images sizes you want to export. you can save the PSD format as well if you want to add some more work with this combined image in Illustrator or any other software. There would be many formats available.
 it would come out and save that location where you wanted to save. The pictures is yours now.

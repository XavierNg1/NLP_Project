 To ready the bok choy for cleaning, you must to break it down into individual pieces. Use a sharp knife to cut off the approximately 2- to 3-inches (5- to 7.5-cm) at the base of the vegetable.Because the bok choy’s base is tough and has dirt trapped inside, you should discard it.;
, Once you’ve removed the bottom of the base, you need to separate the stalks. Use clean hands to gently pull off each stalk at the base of bok choy and place them in a bowl.When you cook the bok choy or mix it into a dish, you may need to cut the leaves and stalks into separate pieces. Do that after you’ve cleaned it.
 After you’ve separated the bok choy stalks, add enough water to the bowl to cover it. Make sure to use cold water to avoid wilting the leaves.If you’re cleaning a large number of bok choy, you may want to place the stalks in a clean sink and cover them with water so they aren’t all overlapping too much.
 Once you’ve covered the bok choy with water, use your hands to gently swish the stalks around to loosen any dirt. Next, let the bok choy sit in the water for about 10 minutes so all of the dirt and sediment has time to settle at the bottom., After the bok choy stalks have sat in the water for several minutes, use your hands to lift them out. Transfer them to a strainer or colander and shake well to remove an excess moisture.Don’t pour the boy choy into the strainer. That will mix the dirt and sediment back in with them.
If you have a salad spinner, you can use it to get rid of the excess moisture from the bok choy.
Check the water after you’ve removed the bok choy. If it is extremely dirty or cloudy, dump it out and repeat the process of soaking the boy choy until the water is mostly clear when you remove it.
 Even after you’ve strained the bok choy, it may still be slightly damp. Use paper towel to gently pat them dry before cooking or mixing the bok choy into a dish.You can use a clean kitchen towel to pat the bok choy dry.

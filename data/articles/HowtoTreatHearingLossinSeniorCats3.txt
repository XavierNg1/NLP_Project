 Regardless of your cat’s age, you should look inside its ears weekly with a flashlight. Check for wax buildup, redness, discharges, and smell for foul odors that indicate infection. Look for tiny, pinhead-sized mites moving within the ear.If you see any of these signs or if your cat constantly scratches at its ears, bring it to the vet as soon as possible.
 Notice if your cat seems unusually aggressive or fearful when you enter a room. This could indicate that it’s losing its hearing, didn’t hear you enter, and was startled. Other behavioral changes include unusually excessive vocalization, failure to respond to being called, and ignoring a food can being opened or other sounds that would otherwise get its attention., If you suspect your cat is experiencing hearing loss, you can issue tests at home to be sure. While it's sleeping or not looking, tear paper or tin foil and see if it responds. You can also jingle your keys or a small change jar.These noises will test its ability to hear high frequency sounds.
 When it’s not looking or while it’s sleeping, get a cardboard box or other hollow object. Tap it and see if your cat responds to the noise.


Drumming sounds will test its ability to hear low frequency pitches.Bring your cat to the vet for a more accurate diagnosis, and let them know the results of your high and low frequency pitch tests.

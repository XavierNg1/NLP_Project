 Castration is a surgical procedure that must be performed by a veterinarian. It is illegal for anyone other than qualified veterinarian to perform this surgery. Cats undergoing castration must be fully anesthetized during the procedure because performing surgery without anesthesia is an act of animal cruelty.;
, Neutering, desexing, or castrating males (these are all different ways of expressing the term castration) is commonly done from 5 -6 months of age, before the cat reaches sexual maturity. There is however, much ongoing debate about the best age to neuter a male cat.Many cat welfare organizations now recommend neutering at a very young age, such as 8-16 weeks old.
The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) supports early age neutering, because of the problem of feral cat populations. In some states neutering before 12 weeks of age is required by law., There are many resources available to make spaying and neutering affordable.If you cannot afford the cost of neutering your cat, speak to your veterinary clinic or an animal welfare charity. Most clinics will be able to put you in touch with charities that offer vouchers for the cost of neutering, or else castrate the animal for you through their own veterinary clinics.


Due to the resources available to those who cannot afford this procedure, it is totally unnecessary to resort to a home procedure.

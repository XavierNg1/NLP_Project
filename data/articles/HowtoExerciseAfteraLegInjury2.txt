 Simple exercises with small movements can increase circulation and prevent blood clots, especially right after surgery. These exercises can be done on your back while lying in bed.


Rotate your ankle or move your foot up and down to increase circulation.
Contract your buttocks and/or thigh muscles for a few seconds and then release the contraction. This will promote blood flow to those areas.
Bend your knees to your chest slowly.
Raise your leg a few inches above the bed or floor. Keep it straight and move slowly to prevent further injury.

 Front loading machines are more gentle than top loading machines. If you use a top loading machine, put your sheets in a laundry/wash bag before you put them in the machine.Wash your sheets separately from other items.


Use a mild detergent to wash your sheets. Avoid any detergents with brighteners and enzymes.It is best to hand wash your sheets a few times before you wash them in the washing machine.
 Select the "delicate" or "hand wash" cycle on your washing machine. Choose whichever cycle has the shortest spin cycle. Excessive spinning will break down the silk fibers and damage your sheets.Wash your sheets in cool water as well.


If your machine does not have a delicate cycle, you should hand wash your sheets instead.Separate your sheets by color if you are washing multiple sets. Silk will release dye when being washed., If you dry your sheets in a dryer, use the heatless, air fluff setting on your dryer. High heat can dull the fabric, shrink your sheets, and weaken the fibers.You can dry your sheets using the lowest heat setting if you would like, but the heatless setting is the best.


Remove your sheets from the dryer when they are about 80% dry.You can also hang dry your sheets once you remove them from the washing machine. This is the most gentle drying option.

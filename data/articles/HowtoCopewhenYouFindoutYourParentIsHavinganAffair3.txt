 In an unfaithful marriage, unfortunately, some parents may try to turn a child against the other parent. This is especially important if the children in the marriage are younger and still living at home.


It might be helpful to suggest that your parents see a counselor. You can lend an ear to your parent, but you should not be their primary shoulder to lean on.
 It is not your job to fix things or to make sure that one parent tells the other parent. While an unfaithful marriage can certainly impact you, the decisions that your parents make are their decisions, not yours.


Don’t report one parent’s activities back to the other parent, and don’t keep secrets for your parents. While it might seem harmless at the time, your parent is using you in a subtle way, and it can be really stressful for you.
 This can be hard to avoid, since you may feel like protecting the parent who was cheated on. But every marriage has two people who contribute, and there may be a larger story going on that you’re not aware of. Try to remain somewhat neutral, as it is not your marriage.

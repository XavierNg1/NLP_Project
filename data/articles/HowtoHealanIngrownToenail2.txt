 Wearing tight shoes and/or socks is a common cause of ingrown toenails.If your shoes are too narrow, try to find some wide shoes in your size or opt for open-toed shoes when possible.


High-heeled shoes may also cause ingrown toenails, so wear flats or low-heeled shoes as much as possible.
Stick to plain white, cotton socks. Dyes from the fabric of colored socks may irritate an ingrown nail.
If you can go without socks and wear sandals instead, then that may help your ingrown nail to heal even faster.
 Cutting your toenails in a curved fashion may increase your chances of developing an ingrown toenail.To eliminate this risk factor, cut your toenails in a straight line and do not cut them too short.
 Repeated stubbing your toe or kicking a ball can lead to ingrown toenails as well.If you think that your ingrown toenails may be due to participation in sports or frequently stubbing your toes, then try getting some protective footwear.


Reinforced or steel toe shoes may help to protect your toes from injury.
 Keeping your feet clean and dry may not prevent an ingrown toenail, but checking your feet often and taking good care of them may help you to detect ingrown toenails before they get out of control. Wash your feet daily and put on a new pair of clean dry socks every day.


Check your feet if you notice any pain or redness in your toes. If you notice that one of your toenails seems to be growing inwards, then take steps to prevent it from progressing.
If you have diabetes, then you need to check your feet every day. If you cannot do it yourself, the you will need to ask someone to do it for you.

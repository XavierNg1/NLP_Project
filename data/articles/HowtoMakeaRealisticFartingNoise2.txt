 Keep your elbow at your side. Your fingers should be pointing at an angle, outwards and towards the opposite hand's direction.
 Take your dominant hand and place the palm on the palm of your non-dominant hand. You want the thumb of your non-dominant hand to line up with second finger joints of your dominant hand. The edge of your dominant hand's palm should stick out a little.
 Both your hands' fingers should wrap firmly around your hands.
 Right now your hands are perpendicular with each other. You need to rotate your dominant hand upwards slightly.
 Move your palms in and out so that the space between them opens and closes. You'll need to practice this and fine tune the movement and speed to get the best realistic fart noise.

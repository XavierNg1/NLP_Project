 Internet Explorer refers to bookmarks as "favorites," and they can be deleted from anywhere by right-clicking on them and selecting "Delete." You can delete them from the Favorites sidebar or from the Favorites menu bar.
 This sidebar will display all of your saved bookmarks. There are a few ways to open it:


Click the Star (☆) button and then click the "Favorites" tab.
Press Alt+C and click the "Favorites" tab.
 You can also view your bookmarks using the Favorites manager. This will allow you to easily expand and collapse your various bookmark folders:


Click the "Favorites" menu and select "Organize favorites." If you don't see the "Favorites" menu, press Alt.
Click folders once to expand or collapse them.
Deleting a folder will delete all of the bookmarks inside.
 Internet Explorer stores your favorites as files that you can find in Windows Explorer. This can make deleting large numbers of bookmarks much easier.


Open a Windows Explorer windows (⊞ Win+E) and navigate to C:\Users\username\Favorites. All of your Internet Explorer bookmarks will be displayed as files and folders.
You can drag bookmark files to the Recycle Bin or right-click on them and select "Delete."

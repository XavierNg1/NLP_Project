 Every 30 minutes, get up from your desk and stretch your legs for a few minutes. This short break allows the muscles in your neck, shoulders, hands, wrists, back and legs to relax from the undue stress that comes with sitting in one position for too long.
 Stretch your wrists before you begin any typing session. Use the prayer position stretch in which you gently push both palms together in front of your chest and then sway from side to side. Do hand rotations, up and down, first with palms and then with the back of the hands pressed together.

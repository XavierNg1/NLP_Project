, Leah usually always has either brown or dark brown hair i think you should dye your hair colour a tone or two darker then your skin colour because having it to light can make your hair look unhealthy. Get a fringe make sure its one that goes to the side it doesn't have to be a side-fringe just make sure it DOESN'T hang in/over your eye's, you've heard MANY on times guys saying the main thing that stands out on a girl her amazingly beautiful eyes!

,, try for a more plump look wear some kissable lip gloss so your lips will stand out.
 Apply black liquid eyeliner on the upper rim thingy of your eye's make sure to not overdo it keep it thin then apply thin amount of eyeliner on the bottom rim. use an eyeshadow two shades lighter then your skin colour and apply it on your eyelids then all UNDER the area of the eyebrow to the eyelid. use one dab of grey eyeshadow and brush it over the black eyeliner on the upper rim so the liquid doesn't look so straight and even. just make sure the grey eyeshadow is even. apply black mascara on the top and bottom of your eyelashes. (don't use more than two coats)

, Use a natural pink shimmer blush and apply it on the cheekbones.
 loose some weight and tone up.

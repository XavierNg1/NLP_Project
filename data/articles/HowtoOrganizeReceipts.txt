 Ideas for categories can be easily adapted from programs such as Quicken or MSMoney.;
, Label the tab of the folder with the name of the main category. On the front face of the folder, write the subcategories that will be contained in that folder. Organize folders alphabetically by category.
, Compile a set of files for each tax year.
 Place your receipts in the corresponding folders.
 If you initiate a new subcategory, write it on the front of the appropriate category folder.
 If a receipt is very small or nearly illegible, staple it to a larger sheet of paper, and write identifying information on the sheet: date, category, location and purpose of expenditure, tax status, reimbursement options, check number, etc.

 Asexual propagation means duplicating the exact plant that grew the year before.


When choosing buds to use for this method remember to choose those that performed the best in your area, so that only those characteristics will be carried forward to the next year.
To begin, wait until the plant has finished its flowering cycle and the leaves of the plant begin to die back and turn yellow. This must be done in the summer to allow enough time for new growth before planting in the fall.;
, Cut the leaves of the daffodil plant back to the ground, leaving a few inches behind. Remove any mulch, rocks, or landscaping materials that you do not want worked into the soil from the area.
 Dig around the area and lift the daffodils with a turning fork.


Remove the bulbs from the bed and lay them aside. On the bulbs should be small offsets that are growing from bulblets or small bulbs on the stem, shoots, and scales.
These bulblets will produce new plants and can be immediately be returned to the soil, they will grow slowly and produce new flowers one to two years after being planted -- so plant them with large parent bulbs for continuous growth.
You will then have to encourage growth. This can be done with three different methods.

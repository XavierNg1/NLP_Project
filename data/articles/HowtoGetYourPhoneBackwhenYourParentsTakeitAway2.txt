 If you do not pay your phone bill, you must understand that the phone is not yours. Make an effort to respect the rules that have been put in place. If you are unclear about these rules, discuss them with your parents.
 Your parents are likely to give you a set of expectations that must be met in order to get your phone returned. Work diligently to meet these expectations.


For example, if your phone usage costed your parents a lot of extra money, they might request that you pay that portion of the bill. Find odd jobs and chores that you can do to earn some extra money to pay off that debt to your parents.
If your parents took your phone away because of poor grades, study every night to ensure that your grades improve. Show your parents your next test grade to prove that you are taking your grades seriously.
 You need to prove to your parents that you take their concerns seriously and will not repeat your mistake. You can prove this to them by repeatedly meeting their requests, instead of simply meeting them when you get in trouble.


This will also prevent your phone from being taken away in the future.

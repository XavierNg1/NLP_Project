 Or you could just remove 1 battery; you just need to make sure the Furby has no power going through it. Screw the bottom back on.;
, Get a pair of scissors and make a small snip in it on both sides of the zipper.
 Now remove it from the Furby. Or if you'd like, you can cut all the way around Furby's bottom, but you will need to remove the zipper later.
 You may have to pull hard the first time if you cut all the way around because the fur is in the zipper.


Once you are past the lip that keeps the fur on, just keep pulling up until you reachÂ the faceplate.
 Once at the faceplate, you will either see that there are 2 screws holding on the faceplate or that there is glue holding it on. If there are screws, unscrew them from the side. If it is glued on, take scissors and cut the inside of the fur from the faceplate.
 Pull the fur up until you get to the very end of the endoskeleton ears.
 Cut that string from both ears with your scissors.



Your fur should be inside out once you have removed it. Flip the fur back the right way.
Now you have your Furby without their fur. Now, you will need to remove the outer shell to access the motor and wiring inside.

 Liking a photo will indicate that you favor that particular photo, and will give other Facebook users the option to connect with you based on your interest.
 If you press "Unlike," the photo will no longer display in your personal profile as an interest.


An alternative way to "like" a photo is to click on the photo to see a full-sized view, then press the "L" button on your keyboard. This action will also "unlike" a photo, if you had previously "liked" it.

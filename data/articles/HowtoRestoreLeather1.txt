 In a bucket or small basin, mix a cleaning solution of dishwashing soap and warm water (one part soap to 8 parts water).Alternatively, purchase saddle soap from a shoe store, department store, or online. Saddle soap contains ingredients like beeswax that add suppleness to leather while cleaning it, but wax or oil may inhibit a filler or compound from properly adhering to the leather. Use a small amount of the soap (i.e. a small dab on a wet cloth) to prevent buildup on the leather., Dip a soft, lint-free cloth into the solution, or dip it into warm water before adding a dab of saddle soap. Wring the cloth out lightly, then wipe down the entire damaged surface of the leather with firm, circular motions. Rinse and repeat., Rinse the cloth and dip it into cool, clean water. Wring out the cloth lightly and run it over the leather surface again. Make sure to remove all soap from the leather. , Once the leather is thoroughly rinsed, let it air dry. Avoid using a heater, blow dryer, or other heat source to speed up drying time. Heat can change the chemical structure of leather, leaving it stiff and misshapen.

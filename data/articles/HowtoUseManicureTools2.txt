 If the nails are much longer than you want them to be, then you will first need to use a straight edged nail clipper to bring down the length.A straight-edged nail clipper will result in some square edges, but it will also allow you to be more accurate.


Clip only a small amount of the nail at a time. Otherwise, you may end up trimming too much.
 Next, you will need to file down any rough edges left on the nail. Use a nail file to smooth out ridges and to start to shape the nail.There are some important things to keep in mind when you file nails. Make sure that you:Start with a fine nail file. Nail files have grits like sandpaper, so choosing a nail file with a high number grit will mean that it is finer. A lower number grit nail file will have a coarser edge. It is best to start with a high grit or fine nail file to avoid tearing or damaging your nails.
File your nails in one motion. Do not use a sawing motion to file your nails. Instead, place the file against one edge of the nail, move it in a swift forward motion, and then remove it from the nail and start over.
Hold the edge of the nail file flat against the edge of your nail. If you angle the file, then this can thin out the nailâ€™s tip and weaken it.
 After you are done filing, use a nail buffer to smooth out the tops of the nails. This will improve the texture of the nails and make it easier to apply and even coat of nail polish.


Use a back and forth motion to buff your nails.
Some nail buffers also include a shine edge that you can use to give nails a natural shine after you finish buffing them.
Buffing your nails is a good nail care practice as long as you do not do it too often. Buff your nails no more than once per week.

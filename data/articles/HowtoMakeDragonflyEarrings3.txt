 For the beads, larger sized beads are best, especially to create the head; if you use seed beads for the body, you'll need quite a few more than using larger beads., More beads means more weight, so take this into account when working out how many beads to use for the body length.
 This will be the "tail" end of the dragonfly and will prevent the beads from sliding off.
 You can use more or less beads depending on the size and type of beads you're using.
 To do this:


Bend a small loop to the right first, then cross over the middle and bend a small loop to the left of the same size. This will form the two lower, smaller wings.
Continuing from the lower left wing, cross over and create a larger loop on the right hand side to make the upper right wing. Then bring the wire back and make a final large loop of the same size on the left side to create the large upper left wing.
Bring the end of the wire to the middle of the dragonfly wings and loop right around to create a wire knot.
 Slide one large bead on to create the head of the dragonfly.
 Don't close this circle; the earring hook needs to slip into it.
, The earrings are now ready to wear.

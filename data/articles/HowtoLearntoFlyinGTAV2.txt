 Landing is one of the trickiest parts of flying an aircraft, whether it's games, simulators, or real life. It’s also probably the most exciting part of flying. A pilot’s skill is almost always judged by his/her ability to land the aircraft smoothly.,, Be careful not to stall, but make sure you're going slowly enough that you won't crash into the runway. Pitch down slightly to descend. Note that this is unrealistic, as in real life you should never go in negative pitch., Then slowly level yourself with the horizon and allow the plane to gently brush the runway asphalt. Decelerate to gain control, and then taxi till the end of runway to the checkpoint., If you want to earn Gold, try to land the plane further down the runway so you don’t have to cover too much distance to reach the checkpoint. Once you are through the checkpoint, use the ailerons to exit the runway to the left to pass through the second checkpoint.

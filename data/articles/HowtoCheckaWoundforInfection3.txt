 You may notice these lines moving along the skin away from the injury. Red streaking of the skin around the wound can mean that an infection has spread into the system that drains fluids from tissues, which is called the lymph system.


This kind of infection (lymphangitis) can be serious and you should get prompt medical attention if you see streaking redness from a wound site, especially if you are also experiencing a fever., The nearest lymph nodes for the arms are around your armpits; for the legs, it would be around your groin area. Elsewhere on the body, the closest ones to check would be the nodes on either side of your neck, just under your chin and jawbone on the left and right side.Bacteria is trapped in these glands during an immune response.Sometimes you can suffer infection to the lymph system without the streaking lines being visible on your skin.
 Use 2 or 3 fingers to apply gentle pressure and palpate the area for any enlarged lymph nodes, which may also be tender. A relatively easy way to find any abnormality is to use both hands to feel both sides simultaneously. Both sides should feel generally the same and symmetrical when healthy., If you can feel either swelling or tenderness, this might be a sign of a spreading infection, even if streaking lines are not present. Your lymph nodes are normally only about a half-inch across and you shouldn’t be able to feel them. They can swell up to two or three times this size at which point you will be able to feel them clearly.Swollen lymph nodes that are softer and move easily usually signify infection or inflammation.
Hard lymph nodes that don’t move, cause pain, or last more than 1 to 2 weeks should be examined by a doctor.

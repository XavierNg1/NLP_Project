 The size is up to how large you wish the bow to be, but for a suggestion, try a rectangle measuring 7.5cm x 5cm (3 inches by 2 inches).
 Glue the end pieces in place, at the join. Allow to dry fully.
 Using your fingers, pinch the rectangle in the middle, to cinch it in. Add glue into the folds to hold the cinched middle in place. Then turn the bow over and add glue in the middle of the front side. Allow to completely dry.
 This can be in the exact same color, or a contrasting color, whichever you prefer.
 The join of the strip must meet at the back, so that it won't be seen. Glue the strip into place and allow to dry.
 Allow to dry.
 It's easy but pretty, so enjoy your homemade felt bow. Once you've got the hang of this, why not make a whole lot more?

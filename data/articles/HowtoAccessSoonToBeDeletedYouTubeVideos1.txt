 Go to the YouTube website (YouTube.com) and click on the search bar. You will not need to scroll to find the search bar, as it is on the top of the page.;
, In the search bar, enter the keywords that best describe the content you wish to view before it is deleted.
 The "Filters" button is directly below and to the left of the search bar. You won't need to scroll down to see it.
 Having clicked the "Filters" button, a kind of window should now have appeared. The "Upload Date" filter option is in the far-right column, under "Sort by Relevance."

, The videos that are now appearing in your search results are the ones that have most recently been added to YouTube. These videos may or may not soon be deleted. If a video violates its Terms of Use, YouTube will probably have it deleted within the first 24 hours of its posting (due, again, to its vigilant monitoring and algorithms).

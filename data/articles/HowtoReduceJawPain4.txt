 If you sleep on your side and you're experiencing jaw pain, you may want to try sleeping on your back at night to remove pressure from your jaw. You may also want to invest in a mouth guard to keep from grinding your teeth at night, as this may contribute to jaw pain without your realizing that it is happening., Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help treat inflammation and other symptoms of jaw pain.
 Gels or mouth swabs containing Benzocaine or similar active ingredients can be found at most drug stores and provide topical pain relief to teeth and jaws., Move your jaw open and closed, then work the jaw from side to side. Gradually increase the frequency of these exercises., First try using a hot compress, but if heat does not alleviate pain or inflammation, try a cold compress.


Run a towel or wash cloth under warm-to-hot tap water. Wring out excess water.
Once the towel is at a comfortable temperature that will not burn the skin, apply it to the affected area of your jaw. Hold the hot compress on for about five to ten minutes, and repeat several times each day.
If a hot compress does not work, use a cold compress or an ice pack. Ice packs should be used for about 20 minutes on, then 20 minutes off.Make sure you wrap the cold compress in a t-shirt or other thin fabric so the cold doesn't damage your skin.
You may also want to try alternating hot and cold compresses to maximize the benefits of each. Use a hot compress for five minutes, then a cold compress for five minutes.

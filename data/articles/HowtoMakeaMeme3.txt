 The best memes are almost square and at least 300px large for readability ease.
 You may also change your text style and the privacy settings of the meme -- whether you want it just to be available to users you show it to, or publicly available.



Social media websites that allow you to share images or videos such as Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, and iFunny are very popular and should let your meme be seen by lots of people.

 You can do this by tapping on Twitter’s icon on your home screen or apps drawer.


If you don’t have the Twitter app yet, you can get it from Google Play (for Android) or iTunes App Store (for iOS). Just search for the app in the app store, tap on the Twitter icon in the search results, and then tap “Install” or “Download” to install the app to your device.
 Click on the box that says email and type in your email address. Then click on the box below it and type in your password.


Once you are finished, click “Log in” to access your account.
 Click on the 3 vertical dots on the top-right side of your screen then click the picture of you and your Twitter handle.


Your profile page will load. Directly below your picture is an “Edit profile” button; click this to begin editing your profile.
 The first and second options in the “Edit profile” page are for your profile picture and header. These can both be edited the same way:


Click on the option you want to change (whether profile picture or header), and click “Choose existing photo.” Your picture library will load.
Select the picture you want to use, and it will automatically upload to your Twitter profile.
 The third option is for your name. Tap the box under “Name” and enter in a new name if you wish.
 Below your name is the Location box. Tap inside this box and type in your location; it can be as specific or vague as you choose.
 The next option is for your website; you can enter any site you want, whether it is your business site or blog. Tap inside the box and type in the URL to your page.
 The final box is for your bio; tap inside the box and type a very brief summary of yourself.


You are limited to only 160 characters.
 When you are finished, go over your changes to make sure everything is what you want it to be, then click the blue “Save changes” button at the bottom of the screen to keep your changes.

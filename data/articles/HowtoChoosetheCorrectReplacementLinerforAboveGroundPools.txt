 The difference between them is the way the liner is held in place inside the swimming pool.


Beaded style liners have a very small groove, or lip, at the top edge of the liner. This small lip is snapped into a track all the way around the inside of the swimming pool at the very top of the pool wall, to hold the pool liner in place. If your swimming pool requires a beaded pool liner, you will be able to see this track by looking under the top rail on the inside of the above ground swimming pool. There are different beads, so be sure to select the proper one.
Overlap style liners are folded over the wall of the swimming pool, and held in place underneath the top rail of the above ground swimming pool. If your swimming pool requires an overlap style liner, you can see a small amount of the pool liner under the top rail on the outside of the swimming pool.;
, The thickness generally indicates how durable the pool liner is, and how long it might last inside a swimming pool. The thicker the pool liner material is, the more durable (and more expensive) it will be.
 While most new pools come with a standard blue liner, replacement liners are available in a wide assortment of colors and patterns.

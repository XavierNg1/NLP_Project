 It can be attached one of the following ways:


Use a self adhering hook with a strong adhesive attached to the bottle.
Attach two eyelet screws to the edges of the hot water bottle and attach string from hook to hook for hanging on a wall hook.
 A dried flower bunch or a single long-stemmed flower make ideal flower displays.


Try matching the flower colors with the water bottle for the most effective display.
If adding water, be sure there are not leaks up to the level you plan on adding water.

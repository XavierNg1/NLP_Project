 The night before, get a good rest. This is said so many times that it becomes a cliché, but it really works. Take a sleeping pill if you're nervous. You should be able to wake up relatively late because Juilliard auditions are not scheduled too early in the morning.
 You don't have to have a three-course meal, but try to stomach some toast and fruit. If you honestly can't eat anything––and that's perfectly natural––then sip something nutritious, like a smoothie.
 If you're a dancer, then you'll obviously be wearing a leotard. If you're a musician, then try to pick out a nice dress if you're a girl. If you're a boy, then wear a shirt and tie. Some people like to wear a suit (you don't have to wear a tux), but if you do then be sure to unbutton it before you start playing, because you don't want your suit to restrict your movement for playing.


Ask your teacher for advice about your selected outfit. He or she may suggest changes to ensure it is going to work well for you.
 It's normal to be nervous! The last minutes before you go into the audition are usually the worst. If you feel like puking, then go to the bathroom and take deep breaths. Tell yourself that you're fine, it'll be all over soon, and the audition honestly doesn't matter.


You might like to eat plenty of peppermints: the mints release an anti-anxiety hormone., It will help you feel secure.
 They'll most likely give you a hug and make you feel better.
 You have worked hard to reach this point, you know you're ready, and all you can do now is the best you can, knowing that you've got the talent and skills well honed. If you succeed, that's great; if not, take it as an experience that will inform future tries.

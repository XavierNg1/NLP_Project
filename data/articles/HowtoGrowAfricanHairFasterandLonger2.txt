 Vitamin supplements can give your hair the nutrients they need to grow faster and stronger.
 Eat food with plenty of protein, such as avocado, pumpkin seeds, or gelatin.
 Leaving your hair down can make your hair vulnerable to breakage. Put your hair in a bun, braids, or other style the keeps your ends tucked away. Fasten your hairdo with bobby pins, since elastic bands can rip out your hair.
 Trim the ends of your hair every two weeks, or whenever they start to split. If your hair is healthy, you may only need to remove 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm) every three or four months. It may seem odd to trim your hair to help it grow, but it really does help. Split ends rapidly lead to breakage, making it very hard to grow your hair out.
 Blow drying, flat irons, over-tight braiding or weaves, over processing, dye and perms ruin your hair. This can cause damage and breakage, so use them as little as possible.

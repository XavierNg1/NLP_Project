Calling cards normally cost between $10 and $50. In general, the more expensive the card, the more calling credit you receive.


There are many options when choosing a calling card, so make sure you compare and read the fine print to decide which one is best for your situation.
You will still be paying a per-minute rate when you use a calling card. This rate, however, will probably be much less expensive than calling without using a calling card. The per-minute rate for calling cards will vary, but usually start around one or two cents per minute.
Be aware of hidden charges. Many calling card companies charge a connection fee or a weekly fee.
 Your calling card will come with an access number. Enter this number into your phone before dialing the Hong Kong telephone number.


It is extremely important to enter the access code, otherwise, you will be charged the normal price-per-minute for international calls instead of the less expensive rate your calling card provides you., Most calling cards require you to choose a PIN. Once you enter your calling card access number, you should be prompted to enter your PIN., After entering your PIN, enter the 8-digit Hong Kong telephone number you are trying to reach., Press the send button on your phone to place your call.

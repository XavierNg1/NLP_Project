 You can choose by flower colour and size. Colours range from white and pink to orange. The sizes range from small clusters of large blooms (P. jasminoides) or large clusters of small blooms (P. pandorana).;
, The pandorea can be grown in full sun to part shade but is frost tender so the plant won't survive freezing temperatures. If you get frosts, best to plant it indoors but allow plenty of room.
 The vine will need something to support it, so add trellis, wire, or climbing posts for it.
 The soil should be free-draining. When preparing, add well broken-down compost to the soil.
 After planting, place plenty of mulch around the plant to keep in the moisture.
 Until the plant is established, it requires regular watering.

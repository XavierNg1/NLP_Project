 To understand why ectopic ureters cause incontinence it is necessary to know a little anatomy:


Kidneys filter blood and get rid of waste products by producing urine. Urine leaves each kidney via a fine tube called a ureter. Each ureter should be implanted into bladder wall such that it empties into the bladder.
An ectopic ureter misses the bladder and instead is implanted downstream in the urethra (the tube through which urine is voided from the bladder.) By-passing the bladder means the valves controlling urine flow are also by-passed, which means as the ureter drips urine into the urethra, when the dog changes position it is likely she will leak urine., Ectopic ureters are diagnosed by giving the patient an intravenous injection of a radio-opaque contrast agent that is excreted by the kidney. A series of radiographs are taken to follow the course of the contrast agent and watch where each ureter deposits urine.
 Treatment is by surgically re-implanting the ectopic ureter into the bladder wall. This is very delicate surgery, again done via laparotomy.


The errant ureter is identified and cut away from the inappropriate site. A small incision is made in the bladder wall and the ureter repositioned over that hole, and carefully sutured in place.
The abdomen is then closed.

 Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water and place a glass, heat-safe bowl on top. Make sure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water.
 Stir the two together with a whisk to help them melt evenly. Coconut oil and cocoa butter are both very moisturizing. Keep in mind, however, that coconut oil can clog pores, so it may not be recommended for those who suffer from acne, blackheads, or oily skin., You can use just one type of oil or a combination of two different types. Consider using any of the following oils:Apricot seed
Avocado
Jojoba
Sweet almond

, Choose 2 to 3 different types of essential oil, then add them to the bowl. You will need 10 to 15 drops total, so you can experiment with different combinations. For example, you could have 4 drops of carrot seed essential oil, 4 drops of Clary sage, and 4 drops of Myrrh. Consider any of the following oils listed below:Carrot seed
Clary sage
Frankincense
Lavender
Myrrh
Rosemary

, Cover the bowl with a sheet of plastic wrap and put it into the fridge. Leave it there for 1 hour so that it can harden and set. This will make it easier to whip later on., Take the bowl out of the fridge, and whisk the mixture together.You can do it by hand with a whisk, but an electric mixer (either stand or handheld) will be much faster and easier. You can even use a food processor fitted with whisks.
 This will set the mixture to its final consistency and make it more cream like., Do not use a plastic jar. The plastic may leach chemicals into the cream over time; the essential oils may also degrade the plastic as well. Use the cream within 6 to 12 months.


Coconut oil has a low melting point. If your cream starts to get too soft, store it in the fridge.

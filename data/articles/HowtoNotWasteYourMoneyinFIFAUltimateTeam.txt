, If you want to know how to do this article you should know how to go into ultimate team! It simply says ultimate team.
 Sell all the players/other stuff you don't need.
 Do not use coins now on stuff you don't need. It should be at least 200 coins.
 Keep notes of areas that need improving.
 About 6-10 should be enough.
 If not, play more matches. The more the merrier!

, Use gold, 500 coins max and the position that is the area that you want. Or go to consumables and the same filters that you used in the players filters. Never go to the kits and balls. Only go there when you really want that item. Same goes to staff, they are not the biggest help, are they? Get them in packs.
 Look at all the things you missed out on! Don't just go all crazy and start bidding. Look at your options. Would you get that 76 rated player for 250 coins, or that 79 rated player for 400 coins? Maybe get both! But use one for back-up. Or get the one that is the better deal.

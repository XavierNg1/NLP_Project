 Use fine-tipped, clean tweezers to do the job. If the tweezers you use are too blunt or unwieldy, the process of plucking can take much longer and cause unnecessary pain. You need to be able to firmly grasp individual hairs and pull them out smoothly.;
, When the skin there is soft and supple, the hairs slide out much more easily. Plucking skin that is dry and stiff will make the experience more painful.









Plan to pluck your brows right after you take a shower. The warm water and steam will have left your skin moist and supple.
If you need to pluck at other times of the day, wash your face with warm water and blot it dry. You could also take a washcloth and put it in the hottest water you can handle, then place it on your eyebrows for 2 minutes. It will open the pores, making it easier to pluck.
Put some lotion on your eyebrows to make them softer and easier to pluck.
 For most people, the hair grows outward from the nose toward the hairline. In some cases, people's brows have hairs growing in more than one direction. Take careful note, because you'll want to pull the hairs in the direction of their growth when you pluck; this helps them come out cleanly.
 The open end should be up. Give it a few squeezes so you're comfortable with the motion you will need to use to pluck your brows.
 (Follow the directions below to figure out which hair you should be plucking). Get as close to the root of the hair as possible and pull, always pulling in the direction of hair growth and keeping the tweezers angled as close to your skin as possible.


Continue this until you have finished plucking one brow, then repeat on the other brow.
If you need to stop and take some breaks, that's ok. Resume plucking when you're ready.
Sometimes plucking eyebrows causes the eyes to tear up and the nose to itch. That's perfectly normal; just keep going until you're finished.

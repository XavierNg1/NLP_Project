 Some tattooists recommend building hand strength by simulating the weight of the tattoo machine applicator. This machine uses an applicator heavier than a pen or pencil to drive ink into the sub-layers of the skin, leaving behind permanent skin art.


You may want to start your weighted practice by attaching about 80 grams (3 ounces) to a drawing utensil.
 Beyond understanding how its working parts operate, how to replace failed parts, and how to assess the working condition of a tattoo machine, you'll also have to become comfortable with holding the applicator for long periods of time.


You might also rig a pencil to your tattoo machine and practice drawing. This way you'll develop comfort and familiarity with machine and clip cord.
While a cheap machine is great for personal practice, you may not want to use your practice machine on clients.

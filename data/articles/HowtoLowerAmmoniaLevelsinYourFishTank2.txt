 Ammonia can be toxic to tropical fish. For this reason, it is important to regularly monitor the water quality of your tank. You should also only add new fish gradually to your tank.Fish are responsible for some of the ammonia output that inevitably ends up in your tank. When you are setting up a new tank, introduce fish slowly.
Add tropical fish to your tank in small groups. Monitor the water to make sure that the ammonia levels are remaining steady.
Ammonia is lethal, so try to keep your levels as close to zero as possible. 0 is the ideal level of ammonia in a fish tank.
 In addition to checking your water, you can look for other symptoms that your ammonia levels are too high. The primary symptom is the death of a new fish. If you add a new fish to a previously healthy tank, that fish might be reacting to unexpected ammonia.Fish who are suffering from ammonia poisoning have trouble getting oxygen they need from the water. Ammonia causes fish gills to stick together and fish can't breathe.
On many tropical fish, you can visually see their gills moving. If you can't see the gills moving anymore, your fish might be in distress.
Non-lethal levels of ammonia can still be a problem. Fish exposed to ammonia will experience stress and might behave differently than usual. They may swim faster than usual or appear erratic in their movements.
 Remember to always take care to keep your fish safe and healthy. If you discover that ammonia levels are too high, take steps to lower them immediately. You should also take precautions to try to prevent levels from rising.Protect your fish by carefully monitoring your population. If a fish dies, it's a sign there might be a problem with your water.
Make sure to relocate your fish if your filter breaks. Consider having a back up tank so that your fish will have a safe place to go.

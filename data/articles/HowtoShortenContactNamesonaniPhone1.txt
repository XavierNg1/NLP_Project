 Do this by tapping the grey gear icon on one of your phone's Home screens (it may be in a folder named "Utilities").;
,, It should be in the middle of the page.


Note that the "short name" setting doesn't apply to the Contacts app itself--all of your contacts' names will be displayed in as full a format as possible there.
 If you don't see any short name options here, you'll need to slide the Short Name switch right to the "On" position first. You can change the way a name appears in a text conversation or while talking on the phone to one of four formats:


First Name & Last Initial
First Initial & Last Name
First Name Only
Last Name Only

, For example, if you want to see only a contact's first time while texting them, you'd tap First Name Only.

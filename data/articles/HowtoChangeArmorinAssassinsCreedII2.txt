Armor is broken down into different pieces and types, allowing players to purchase new sets piece by piece.
Armor adds a certain number of health squares to your life bar and comes with a set number of hit points that indicate how much damage you can take before needing repairs. These numbers correspond, so if an armor piece's hit points are depleted, the health squares it provided will be locked and unused. Each piece can be repaired separately or a set can be repaired altogether at a blacksmith.

The Helmschmied armor set includes Helmschmied Greaves for 4,940 florins, Helmschmied Vambraces for 5,100 florins, Helmschmied Spaulders for 6,200 florins, and Helmschmied Chest Guard for 10,800 florins.
The Metal armor set includes Metal Greaves for 7,200 florins, Metal Vambraces for 6,300 florins, Metal Pauldrons for 12,000 florins, and Metal Chest Guard for 17,200 florins.
The Missaglias armor set includes Missaglias Greaves for 14,600 florins, Missaglias Vambraces for 12,000 florins, Missaglias Pauldrons for 21,300 florins, and Missaglias Chest Guard for 27,900 florins.
 Once you buy a piece of armor, the menu will ask if you wish to equip it. This will automatically apply the piece to your character. Select "Yes" to confirm the action.

 Allergies can give you puffy eyes, but cold can help reduce that puffiness. For instance, try keeping a gel-filled eye mask in your fridge. Put it on your eyes for about 10 minutes on the mornings when they're puffy. If you don't have a mask, use what you have, even slices of cool cucumber or ice wrapped in a washcloth., If your eyes are red and itchy, consider applying some eye drops to help reduce the problem. You can use eye drops just meant for redness, or you can use ones that have antihistamine in them, meant to help combat your allergies. You'll find both in any pharmacy., Using a dark eyeliner can make your eyes seem brighter. Navy is a particularly good choice. Another option is to cancel out the redness by using an eyeliner that matches your skin tone., Another way to brighten your eyes (and diminish redness) is to use a bright eye shadow on just your inner eye. It can make that part pop, diminishing the appearance of redness in your eye., When buying mascara and eyeliner, pick waterproof versions of these makeups. Otherwise, if you have itchy, watery eyes, the makeup may run. Using waterproof versions will keep it in place, helping you look your best., Because allergens can attach themselves to almost anything, try using mascara wands that you can throw away. That way, you're not reintroducing allergens to your eyes each time you put on mascara.

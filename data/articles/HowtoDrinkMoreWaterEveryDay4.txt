 Drinking a glass of water — or at least a few sips — before, during, and after eating any meal is a great way to up your daily water intake.
 Replace your typical drink during meals with water, or at least have water to drink on the side. Not only can this save you money when you eat out, but it can also cut the calories you consume by drinking and make you less likely to consume additional calories from food., Drinking water during and after each meal can help you feel full longer after eating and aid in the digestion of your food.

 Try using the tip of the nail or screw to make a small indentation, easy enough to see and center the tip of the nail or screw.


Having a small hole or indentation to start with will guide the tip keeping it where your hole and nail should be.
If it is difficult to see the indentation and you don't mind marks or stains on the wall, you can use a pencil or a marker to mark where the nail or screw should go.;
, The comb should pinch and hold the nail well enough to hold the nail steady and straight while you drive it in with a hammer or with a drill if it is a screw., Unless you have a good grip on the nail or screw when you commence driving it in the tip can slide or fall right off.


Having a small indentation or hole to guide and center the tip can save you many nails screws and even avoid some injuries.
If there is not enough pressure holding the nail or the angle of your nail and hammer or if the drill are not leveled or straight, the nail could end up bending or flying off.
 If the nail and comb combo match up properly, the comb should hold the nail in place as you hammer away.

 If one of your legs seems stronger than the other, you can build leg strength in one area by doing single leg squats. To start, get in the squat position. Then, lift up the leg you're not going to be strengthening.For example, say you want to build muscle in your right leg. Hold up your left leg. Hold slightly in front of you or slightly behind you, depending on what helps you maintain balance. Then, do a squat with only your right leg and return to the starting position.
Remember to lower your body as low to the ground as possible when doing a squat. Stop if you feel uncomfortable.
 Adding a jump to your squat adds some cardio and forces you to work your muscles harder. To jump when you squat, get in the squat position. Then, lower yourself downward like you're doing a regular squat. When you're about halfway down, propel yourself upward and jump so both of your feet are in the air. After you land, return to the starting position and repeat.For added variation, you can swing your arms in the air when you jump.
 To add weight, you will need a dumbbell. Start with only a light amount of weight, such as five pounds, to avoid straining yourself. You can add more weight with time. Place the bar across your back, holding your shoulders firm for support. Then, do your three by five repetitions as normal. Adding a little weight can increase muscle definition.Be conscious of keeping your back and shoulders tight the entire time if you choose to add weight.
 If you increase the time you're holding a weight, this will build more muscle. When lifting with a weight, pause at the bottom of your squat. Hold the position for two to six seconds before returning to the starting position. Do this for your regular three by five repetitions.Only pause for as long as is comfortable for you.

 Fresh okra has a gooey substance inside that many find unappealing. The method of removing this substance is called "de-sliming." Wash the okra and place it in a bowl with a quart of water and a cup of vinegar. Allow the mixture to soak for an hour. When an hour has passed, drain the okra, rinse it in fresh water, and pat dry with paper towels. Chop the de-slimed okra into bite-sized pieces and reserve in a container.

 Slice any sausage, andouille or tasso you're using into bite-sized slices, and store them in a container. Cut the whole game or poultry you have chosen to use into bite-sized pieces. Rinse the pieces, pat them dry with a paper towel, and reserve in a separate container. Refrigerate the meat until you're ready to compile the gumbo.
 Discard the shells and reserve the seafood in a sealed container. Refrigerate it until you're ready to compile the gumbo.

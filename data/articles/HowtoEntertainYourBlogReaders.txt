 The readers of your blog would like to see at least some sort of new post every now and then. Posting at least once a day can keep them satisfied, although three or four times a week could be enough if you don't have the time.;
, Never talk about the exact same thing for an extended period of time; not everyone wants to read about your new pair of shoes throughout the whole week. This shouldn't be a problem if your blog is about a certain topic but you could try to keep things interesting by changing things up whenever you can.
 Try to talk about different topics. One blog post could be about how much you love wikiHow, while the next could be about a new movie that you're eager to see. Random blogs can be quite amusing for readers because they never know what to expect - and they love that!

, Add pictures that are relevant to the theme of the blog. If you mentioned that it snowed today, why not a post a picture of you out in the snow with friends? Another example, for a fashion blog, would be posting a picture of you wearing the outfit that you wore that day. It may be even be worth talking about where you bought your clothes from and even where you went and what you did.
 Videos are a lot more entertaining than pictures or just text. Putting videos related to your topic on your blog will not only entertain people but they can also help people understand things more if you're trying to explain something.
 You can add gossip about celebs from time to time or what's going in the world of sports and athletics.
 Expressing your own opinion is fine but avoid coming across as arrogant or ignorant. Another thing to avoid are racial/religious slurs. It may be safe to avoid political or religious topics altogether unless your blog has anything to do with politics or religion - even if you aren't being offensive, some people just don't want to hear it. Making any of these mistakes just once has the potential to put people off from reading your blog completely.

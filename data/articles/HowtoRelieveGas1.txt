 If you're experiencing extreme gas pain, trying to hold the gas inside your body for the sake of social decorum is only going to make the pain worse. Remember that the average person passes gas ten times per day, and there's nothing abnormal about needing to do so, even if the timing seems inconvenient.


It might help to find a restroom and stay there until the bout of gas pain has subsided. If possible, stay at home and allow yourself to completely recover before going about your day.
When you're in a comfortable place, relax your muscles and change your positioning so the gas can exit your body more easily.;
, Gas leads to uncomfortable tightness in the abdominal region, and this pain can be eased by treating it with heat.


Fill a hot water bottle, lie down on your bed or on the couch, and place the bottle over your stomach. The heat will help relieve the tightness.
A hot bath also helps ease the pain of gas and constipation.
 Both mint and ginger have properties that settle the stomach and aid the digestion process. Boil a few leaves of mint or some chopped ginger, strain the hot tea into a mug, and sip it slowly.
 Garlic stimulates the gastric system and helps relieve gas quickly.Chop some cloves of fresh garlic and saut√© them in a little olive oil. Add chicken or vegetable broth, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Eat the soup hot.
 Drugstores offer a lot of options for indigestion medication. Since you're already experiencing gas pains, choose one that is meant to be taken after eating, not before.

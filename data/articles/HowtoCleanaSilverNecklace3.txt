 Start with an aluminum pie plate or a bowl with aluminum foil covering the inside. Add a tablespoon (15 milliliters) of salt to the plate. Next, add a tablespoon of either water softener powder OR baking soda.While some people use this method on necklaces with precious or semi-precious stones, it could cause damage, so it's better not to risk it if it is valuable. Similarly, it's best not to try this method on antique or fragile silver.
This process will remove all the tarnish, including decorative oxidized areas (black areas put in place to create a design).
You can also add 1/2 a cup (118 milliliters) of white vinegar at this point. Keep in mind, vinegar will cause the baking soda to react, so watch for overflow., Next, pour in hot water. A cup (237 milliliters) or so will be enough. It should be close to boiling, but it doesn't need to be boiling. Stir the water, making sure the salt and baking soda are fully dissolved into it., Once the solution is ready, put the necklace in the solution. It should be touching the aluminum, so that the tarnish will move from the silver to the aluminum. Let it soak for a couple of minutes. You can do a bit more if the necklace is especially tarnished., Use tongs or a fork to take the necklace out. With a microfiber, polish any areas on the necklace that need a bit more work. Be gentle with more fragile areas. Dry the piece off, and put it away.

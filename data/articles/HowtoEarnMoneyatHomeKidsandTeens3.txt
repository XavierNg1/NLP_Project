 If you're in an area that naturally produces something people might want, take advantage of it. Not everybody has the resources you do, if you look close enough.


If Mistletoe grows in the hills around your home, start bagging it up! You can start the holiday spirit going from house to house. If the beach is near you, think of what you could do with sand, shells, or other beach-y goods.
 You'll have to get up very early, but it's good money and good exercise. You probably know someone who has done this before -- if you don't, you haven't asked!


You may be able to get a route that's all around your neighborhood. Ask your parents about this and seek out your local newspaper for options.
 If you're stellar in a school subject, you may be able to tutor students who are younger than you -- at any school in the area, if you have a ride. Go online and talk to your teachers -- they may even be able to point you to a few kids who need help.


Keep your grades up! If you don't, you may not be able to tutor anymore. Who knew studying could get you money?

, If you are artistically inclined, put it to good use. You'll have to either work the kid angle or be very, very good, but it is a reasonable way to make money. Pick your craft and go around your neighborhood flashing your dimples and pearly whites. Who could resist what you're selling with that face and that smile?


Think about the holidays. What can you make that people might like for Easter, July 4th, Thanksgiving, Christmas, or New Year's? Could people buy your crafts as gifts for others?

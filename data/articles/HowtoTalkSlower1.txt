 One of the biggest problems for people who speak too quickly is that they often blur words together in a way that can be difficult to understand. Spend some time practicing how you enunciate words, especially when you string them together in a sentence.Don’t skip over any words, not even the small ones. Enunciate each syllable of every word.;
, Tongue twisters are designed to help you work out the muscles in your mouth, and improve your own pronunciation. Try various tongue twisters to help you warm up your voice before a speech, or just to help you slow down your vocal cadence in general.Try saying, “The lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue” over and over. Exaggerate each syllable.
Repeat the words “rubber baby buggy bumpers.” Say each word clearly. Repeat the phrase again and again.
 While practicing your enunciation, try stretching your vowel sounds to add length to each word. This will help you speak more slowly and more clearly.Exaggerate it at first and add a short pause between each word. Over time, this will help you learn to not link your words together so intensely while still enunciating each word clearly.

 Henna powder is derived from the henna flower. The powder is made into a paste that is applied to skin or hair to turn it a coppery reddish color. Henna powder typically comes in 100-gram boxes, which is the perfect amount to dye medium-length hair.


Paprika and clove powder can also be used to dye your hair various shades of red. If you don't have access to henna powder, try one of these spices instead.
 According to the instructions that came with your henna powder, mix the powder with spoonfuls of water until you have a creamy paste. If you want to lighten your hair as well as turning it red, use lemon juice in place of water. Cover the paste and let it sit overnight. Stir in one more spoonful of water the next day, and the henna paste is ready to go.
 Wet your hair (no need to shampoo it), towel dry it, and comb through it to remove any tangles. Put on a pair of latex or plastic gloves to protect yourself from the dye. Use your fingers to work the henna paste through your hair, making sure to cover every strand.


If a stray bit of henna paste gets on your skin, wipe it off right away. Henna paste will dye your skin just as easily as it dyes your hair.
For henna highlights, separate strands of hair you'd like to highlight from the rest of your head using strips of aluminum foil. Paint the henna paste onto the strands of hair using an old pastry brush.
 Put on a shower cap or use a few pieces of plastic wrap to cover your hair while the dye sets in. Let it sit in your hair for at least 4 hours. The longer you let it sit, the redder your hair will be.
 Use cold water to wash out the dye. Keep running the water through your hair until it runs clear instead of red. Wait until the next day before shampooing your hair. Your hair will be rich red at first, and over the course of a few days it will lighten.

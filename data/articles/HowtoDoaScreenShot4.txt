This will cause the Grab toolbar to appear.
 You should notice several menu options along the toolbar. Click on Capture, usually positioned next to the Edit menu.


A drop-down menu will appear.
 You can capture a screenshot as a Selection, Window, Screen, or Timed Screen.


Taking a Selection will allow you to select a specific area of your screen to take a picture of.
Taking a Window will take a picture of a specific, open window.
Taking a Screen will take a picture of the entire screen.
Taking a Timed Screen will allow you to delay the screenshot by 10 seconds.
 If you choose the Selection option, you will need to draw a box around the area you want to take a screenshot of.


A crosshair should appear in place of your cursor. Click and drag this crosshair around the area you want to save.
 Your screenshot should automatically appear on the screen. All you need to do is save it.


The file will be saved as a Tiff image.
 Change the file name to something memorable.


If desired, you can also change the location of your file from the Save dialog box.
 This saves the file and completes the process.

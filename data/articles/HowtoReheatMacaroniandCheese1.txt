 Make sure your bowl is glass or microwave-safe plastic before proceeding.


Don't reheat more than you are going to use, as the more times you reheat it, the less appetizing your macaroni and cheese will become.;
, Pasta continues to absorb moisture after it is cooked, which means that the longer your macaroni and cheese sits, the dryer it will become.The secret to maintaining or reviving the original texture is to add a bit of milk when you reheat it. The amount needed will depend on your macaroni and cheese. Start by stirring in 1 tablespoon of milk per cup of macaroni and cheese. The milk will not fully incorporate until the macaroni is heated, so don't worry if it looks a bit wet at first.


You may also substitute half and half or cream for a richer texture and flavor.
 Leave one corner slightly open to release steam.If you do not feel comfortable using plastic wrap in the microwave, you can also put an inverted plate over the dish, but be sure to use an oven mitt when removing it, as the plate can become hot. It will also release hot steam that can burn you.
 This will reduce the likelihood that the cheese will break down and separate, resulting in oily macaroni and cheese. Set the timer for 1 minute for a single serving, or 90 seconds for a larger portion. When the timer goes off, stir the macaroni and cheese. Then continue to heat it in 30-60 second intervals until it reaches the desired temperature.


If your microwave does not have a turning carousel, heat your macaroni and cheese in 45 second intervals, and turn the bowl in between.
 Even the most carefully reheated macaroni and cheese can lose a bit of flavor. To perk yours up, try sprinkling on some parmesan cheese, salt and pepper, a bit of butter, or some garlic salt. For a bit more adventure, you might try adding ketchup, a dash of cayenne pepper, or even hot sauce. Bon app√©tit!

 Copper is a specific type of material and needs to be treated with a specific polish. Things like silver or metal polish can easily damage copper. When selecting a commercial polish, make sure it's a polish specifically made for copper.You can buy copper polish online or at a hardware store.
 Use a soft cloth to wipe any dust off your copper. Dust can get plastered onto copper if it's not wiped off before the polishing process. This is especially important for copper that's been stored in a dusty area, like an attic, for a prolonged period.
 Apply your polish to a polish cloth. The amount you need varies. Use a generous amount of polish for very tarnished pieces and only a light amount for copper that only requires a light polishing.
 Use your polishing cloth to buff your polish into your copper. Apply a decent amount of pressure to remove any tarnish. Keep polishing until your copper shines.
 Use clean water to rinse off any remaining polish after you're done. Then, gently pat your copper dry. Make sure to get the copper completely dry as water can cause copper to rust.

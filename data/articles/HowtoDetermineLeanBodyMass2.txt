 You may have seen a bioelectrical impedance scale at your gym or personal trainer’s office. These scales have electrodes you stand on, and they send gentle electricity through your body to measure your body fat percentage (fat and muscle conduct electricity differently).They are safe and you don’t feel a thing. Simply stand barefoot on the scale and follow the instructions.


Some scales will tell you your LBM directly, though most will probably just determine your body fat percentage.
You can purchase one of these scales to use at home to keep track of your body fat percentage over time.
This is an easy-to-use method, but is not always very accurate.
 Hydrostatic, or underwater, weighing compares your weight on land to your weight while completely submerged in water. A skilled technician can then calculate your body fat percentage. This is a very accurate method, but it can cost between $40-60 on average. Find a research lab or performance center who does underwater weighing near you.A “bod pod” (or air displacement plethysmography machine) is similar to hydrostatic weighing, except it uses air instead of water. It is pretty accurate when testing people who are close to a healthy BMI, though may be less accurate for very lean people.Research your area to find one near you.
 A dual-energy x-ray absorpiometry (DEXA) scanner is used like an x-ray – it’s a harmless and very accurate, though probably expensive, procedure. It is usually used to measure bone density and monitor osteoporosis. This is a very accurate option, but you have to see a medical professional that provides DEXA scans. It may also be expensive.Talk to your family doctor for more information.

 Because placeholders are not only purposeful, but are also a decorative element, it is important that they compliment the wedding's color scheme and theme. For example, if the wedding reception is an outside garden party, floral-printed frames might be more appropriate favors than stately candlestick holders.;
, There are a number of places where you may look to find placeholders for your reception, such as online wedding supply stores, craft stores, retailers and/or wholesalers. Anything can be used as a wedding reception placeholder, as long as you can put a name on it. Consider the following ideas:


Frames make great wedding reception gifts, as you can insert guests' name cards in them to serve as placeholders, and guests can take them home to use as picture frames.
Statuettes can be personalized to function as placeholders. You may opt to hang name tags on the figures, or choose figures that can hold place cards with guests' names on them.
Utilitarian items like jewelry boxes, photo albums and planters can double as placeholders and reception favors. Simply print, stencil or engrave your guests' names on the items and put them at each place setting.
Edibles can be used as placeholders. For example, you may opt to use candy bars with the wedding details and the guests' names printed on the wrappers, wrap candies in decorative sacks tied with name tags or use icing to write names on cookies.
 The larger your budget, the more expensive your favors should be. A good rule of thumb is to spend at least $2.50 per guest, but you may be able to spend more, considering your favors will be doing double-duty as placeholders.

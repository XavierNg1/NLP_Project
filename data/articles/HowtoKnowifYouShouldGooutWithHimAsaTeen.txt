 If the pros over-do the cons, it means you can deal with the bad things because the good things matter the most. While making the list, don't be too harsh on the cons! Try to keep away from annoying habits, like "nibbles on his nails too much".;
, If he compliments you, or tries to make you smile when you're sad, he's a keeper. But if he insults you and yells at you, throw that sucker away.
 You can never have chemistry with someone who you can't even express yourself with!

, Signs of yelling, continuous teasing, and criticizing you means he's not patient at all. No, it means that he doesn't like you or respect you in any way.
 Or does he hide you like you don't exist? If you said yes to the first one, he's capable of being a good boyfriend. When he shows you off to his friends, it's a symbol of pride to him that he's with the most amazing girl in the world. If not, he's just trying to not seem so "sprung"!

, Don't get me wrong: he does like you, but he doesn't like you enough to be open & honest with you, which is a key in relationships.
 If this guy changes his feelings with you because you aren't wearing any makeup, he's not the one for you. A good boyfriend will like you for who you are, whether you look a model or have sack over your head.
 If he does, it means that he likes the thought of a hot hook-up more than a stable relationship. Don't rush to do things you don't want to do, you're only a teenager!

, It's a pretty big key to relationships. Relationships require good work and people change constantly to make each other happy. If he's not willing to do that for you, it means he doesn't care very much, and you need someone that cares.

 The boxes should be of a good height for your dog to leap over.


The more enclosed the area, the better. That way your dog cannot circumvent the jump but must go over it to reach you.
 If you do choose the toy, have treats as a reward.
 This will familiarize him with going over the box.
 Make it fun, so that he wants to come with you.
 He must be on the opposite side. Use the toy or treat to entice the dog to come to you, using the jump.



If your dog jumps, reward him with a treat and praise.
If your dog walks around the jump, do not reward him but make him repeat the action until he jumps.



When your dog is more familiar with jumping, you can remain alongside the dog and toss the toy over the jump and ask him to jump to get the toy.
Over time, you can increase the difficulty of the height or shape of the jumps, to give him a bit of variety.

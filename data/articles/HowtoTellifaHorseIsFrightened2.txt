 When your horse snorts, he holds his head high with his mouth shut, and exhales forcefully through his nose. This causes a loud fluttering sound in the nostrils which lasts for about a second.Snorting indicates your horse has identified a potential danger, and is investigating it.
If your horse shies away from something after snorting, this indicates fear.
 Blowing is similar to snorting, but without the loud flapping sound in the nostrils. It makes a softer sound.Horses do this when they are curious about something, or when meeting another horse.
If the horses get along, they will calmly continue to snort in greeting. If they feel threatened, one or both animals will squeal or nip at the other.
If your horse blows and then becomes tense or shies away from an object, he is showing signs of fear.
 When your horse nickers, his vocal chords emit a vibrating sound through his closed mouth. This does not indicate fear – it is a greeting directed at a person or another horse., When your horse squeals, he creates a noise that can either be short and soft, or long and loud. A loud squeal can be heard from quite far away.


A squeal indicates resistance to something – your horse may not be afraid, exactly, but he is not happy about what he's being asked to do.
 A neigh is a very long sound that is the combination of a squeal and a nicker. A horse neighs when he is separated from other horses.


A whinny or neigh does not indicate fear. Your horse is trying to determine where his companions are.
When another horse hears a neigh, he will usually whinny in return. This lets the first horse know he isn't alone.

 Always keep on walking with your head facing in front of you. Having your face turned to someone is easy to notice and will often get you busted.;
, As tempting as it is, avoid making hand gestures to indicate things, even shrugging can give you away. Try to keep your hands at your side, if you have to make hand gestures make them quick and keep them below your chest.
 Never let your voice go above a hoarse whisper. Don't talk too softly that you have to duck your heads to hear each other, but never talk normally.
 Look out for places teachers may stand at without you seeing them. Places like this include:


Stairwells






Doorways






Tight turns

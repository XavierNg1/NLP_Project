 If you really want to do something, but your family doesn't agree with you or think you're really serious about it, you need to explain to them the exact line of reasoning, very specific reasons why you want to do that thing. If you can, show them why the alternative would be worse.
 Show your family that you mean business by working really hard and putting your heart into what you do. This is much more likely to earn their respect and get them to take you seriously. They also need to SEE you working hard, so give them opportunities to see you doing what you do best.
 If you tell a family member that you will do something, you need to follow through on that. If they see you as someone that just makes empty promises, they will be very unlikely to take you seriously.
 If you are lying all the time, then don't expect people to believe you. They aren't going to bother with you because they can't trust you to tell them the right information. Your family especially will be able to tell if you are lying, so be truthful with them to avoid being written off.

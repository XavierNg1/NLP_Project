 If you are having a really tough time with bad skin and blackheads, pay a visit to your doctor or dermatologist for some advice. She will be able to examine your particular skin type closely and provide the best type of treatment for you, be it something from the store, pharmacy, or even a natural remedy.
 There are some products that dermatologists can prescribe if you have if you have acne that is not getting better with over-the-counter products. This is not for people who just have a few awkward blackheads on their nose every now and then.


Your doctor may prescribe benzoyl peroxide. It is comedolytic (unclogs pores), anti-inflammatory, and also has been shown to reduce the bacteria thought to play a role in acne.
 It is possible that your dermatologist may prescribe you a course of antibiotics to take orally alongside a topical treatment if you also have inflammatory acne lesions alongside your blackheads.This will only be in the most serious cases.

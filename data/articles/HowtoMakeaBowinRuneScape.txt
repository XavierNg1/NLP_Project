 If you're starting on bows, regular logs are needed. Once you advance levels, you may cut down and use higher level trees.
 Click on the knife and then on one log. It will give you a screen with different kinds of items you can create with the kind of log you clicked on. You'll only be able to click on selections that you're able to with the level you're at.
 After, you'll get an "unstrung bow" in your inventory in place of the log.
 Use a spinning wheel and create bowstring. Or, for a little more GP, you can buy bowstring straight from other players.
 Then click on the other item. Combining the two will create a complete bow.

 Washing your hands is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of infections. Ascaris infection is frequently spread through ingesting larvae and eggs which may get on your hands. Washing your hands is critical to prevention, especially after going to the washroom and before eating. Wash your hands with soap and water, while scrubbing for at least 20 seconds in order to remove unwanted parasites and bacteria. Sing happy birthday twice while scrubbing to make sure you wash them long enough.
Rinse hands and dry using a clean towel.;
, Ascariasis is most often transferred after soil becomes contaminated with fecal matter. As a result, it is important to ensure that all fecal matter is disposed of in an isolated area and will not come into contact with any crops or water that may be consumed. Once eggs are in the environment they persist for a long time. It is very important to ensure that they do not enter the environment in which you are living.
 In some countries, due to poor sanitation, fecal matter is able to mix with local water and soil sources. Often children will then play in the mud allowing eggs to transfer to the childrenâ€™s hands. Teach your children the importance of washing their hands regularly and not putting their hands in their mouths without washing. The majority of those suffering from an Ascaris infection are children under the age of 10.
 Fecal matter can get trapped under fingernails and may be difficult to remove while washing your hands. By keeping your fingernails short you may be able to prevent eggs from getting trapped and later ingested.

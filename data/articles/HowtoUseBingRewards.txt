 This explains what Bing rewards can do for you, and what you can get out of the experience.



Perform searches on Bing itself, to obtain credits. Most often, you can obtain 1 Bing Rewards credit for every 2 searches you do.
Check out the "Earn and Explore" category from the special Bing Toolbar that was provided with Internet Explorer and even on the Bing website itself. There are even special searches that can help you obtain a few more points just by clicking the button for all these other optional searches, waiting for it to complete the search and hitting the back button on your browser, if you didn't really want to see that search page anyway (free credits earned quickly). You can earn credits by clicking any link in the "Earn and Explore" category marked with a credit value, by making searches while signed in on Bing, or by reaching Silver Status. Most of your points will come from searches, which let you earn up to 15 credits per day (30 once you reach gold) for every 2 searches you make.
 (There is a limit of 50,000 lifetime credits obtained from invitations sent and accepted by your friends).
 With the plethora of opportunities you can now redeem them for, there's no reason why you shouldn't use Bing Rewards. Once you have enough credits, you can redeem them for rewards in the redeem tab. Here you can see each of the prizes offered to Bing rewards users and their credit values. Once you have enough credits for a prize, you can click the "redeem" button underneath it and, after submitting the required info, Microsoft will send you your prize.
 You might very well win something.
 After that, all that's left to do is reap the benefits of your reward!

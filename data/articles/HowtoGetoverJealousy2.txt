 If you feel isolated, force yourself to go out with friends and family. Keep your time and mind occupied. Join clubs, make new hobbies, or set new goals for yourself. If you have nothing to do, it’s easy to obsess over jealousy.
 For example, watching your partner’s interactions on social media can trigger jealousy, even if it’s just another person liking his or her posts. If this describes your behavior, stop checking your partner’s social media page.


If you encounter a trigger anyway, avoid over-thinking it. Just move on to something else right away.
 You don’t need to give your partner the cold shoulder. Just make sure you’re not chasing him or her down too much for comfort. There may be less suspicion between you if you both work out a compromise for how closely and often you interact.
 Work on your self-image physically, mentally, and emotionally. This will cheer you up and give you a chance to take your mind off things. The better you treat yourself, the more confident you’ll be in your relationship.
 Have a sincere conversation with your partner. Explain that you know these feelings are not necessarily rational, but that you still feel them. Ask your partner to consider your feelings in situations that make you jealous. Don't ask for major changes, just for some sympathy in everyday life.


Your partner might get mad at this. Reassure him or her that this is the best thing for your relationship: honesty and communication.
 Agree on boundaries for appropriate behavior. The jealousy may take time to fade, but this will help. As long as you both stay within these boundaries, you can have confidence in the relationship.

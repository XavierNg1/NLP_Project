 To use this method, you should see a monomial in the numerator and in the denominator of your rational expression. A monomial is a polynomial with one term.For example, the expression 4x16x2{\displaystyle {\frac {4x}{16x^{2}}}} has one term in the numerator, and one term in the denominator. Thus, each is a monomial.

The expression 4x+416x2−2{\displaystyle {\frac {4x+4}{16x^{2}-2}}} has two binomials and thus cannot be solved using this method.

, To do this, write out the factors you would multiply together to get the monomial, including the variable. For more information on how to factor, read Factor a Number. Rewrite the expression using the factors in the numerator and the denominator. For example, 4x{\displaystyle 4x} would factor as 2×2×x{\displaystyle 2\times 2\times x} and 16x2{\displaystyle 16x^{2}} would factor as 2×2×2×2×x×x{\displaystyle 2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times x\times x}. So, factored out, your expression will look like this: 2×2×x2×2×2×2×x×x{\displaystyle {\frac {2\times 2\times x}{2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times x\times x}}}


, To do this, cross out factors in the numerator and denominator that match. These cancel out because you are dividing a factor by itself, which equals 1.For example, you can cross out two 2s and one x in the numerator and the denominator:2×2×x2×2×2×2×x×x{\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {2}}\times {\cancel {2}}\times {\cancel {x}}}{{\cancel {2}}\times {\cancel {2}}\times 2\times 2\times {\cancel {x}}\times x}}}


, Remember that terms cancel to 1. So if you have canceled all the terms in the numerator or denominator, you will still be left with 1.  

For example:2×2×x2×2×2×2×x×x{\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {2}}\times {\cancel {2}}\times {\cancel {x}}}{{\cancel {2}}\times {\cancel {2}}\times 2\times 2\times {\cancel {x}}\times x}}}12×2×x{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2\times 2\times x}}}


, This will give you your final, simplified rational expression.

For example:12×2×x{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2\times 2\times x}}}14x{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4x}}}

 It's the app that lets you send text messages to other phone numbers from your device. Depending on your device model, it could be called Messages, Messenger, Text Messages, or Android Messages.

If you're using a tablet, you can open any app that lets you take a note, send a message, or write text in any form. If you can't find a suitable app on your device, you can open your email and use the text field in an email's body, or get Google Drive and create a new document.;
, In your text message app, tap the new message button to start a new, empty text message. This button will look like a "+" or a pencil icon on most devices.

Alternatively, you can start a new message in a different messaging or chatting app such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or Google Hangouts.
 This is the text field on your screen where you type in your message. A pop-up menu will appear.

On some devices, you might have to add a recipient and hit the Next button before you can tap on the message field.
 If you have anything on your clipboard, you will see a Paste option on the pop-up menu. Tapping on it will paste your clipboard into the message field., Now that you know what's on your clipboard, you can discard the message you've started. This way, you can see what you currently have on your clipboard without sending this message to anybody.

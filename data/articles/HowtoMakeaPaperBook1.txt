 Spend some time folding, as the quality of your folds will determine the quality of your book.








Be sure your folds are even and you crease each one well. Consider sliding your fingernail or something hard such as the edge of a pencil over the crease.
Start by folding the paper so that it is long and skinny (long edge folded to long edge).
Then fold the paper in half short edge to short edge.
Fold the paper in half again, short edge to short edge.;
, You will see eight separate panels. These will become the pages of your book.
 You should fold the paper in half the opposite way from your first fold.
 Place the paper so that the folded edge is facing you. Then cut along the vertical fold seam in the middle of the paper until it intersects the horizontal fold seam.









Be sure you stop cutting at the horizontal seam. You are just cutting a slit in the paper, you are not cutting it all the way across.
 It should now have the original eight fold panels, but there should be a slit down the center of the paper, between the middle four panels.
 Repeat your very first fold. The cut part of the paper should fall along the middle of the folded edge.
 Turn your paper so that the cut edge is up in the air. Then push the two ends toward each other. Separate the two middle seams from each other.








You will need to reverse the direction of the fold on one of the seams.
Push the two ends towards each other until you have 4 “wings” moving outward from the center, like a cross or an X., Choose two adjacent “wings” of the paper and push them towards each other, enclosing the other pages of the book inside them.
 If you would like for the book to hold its shape, you may want to bind your book using staples or string (see “Binding Your Book” below).

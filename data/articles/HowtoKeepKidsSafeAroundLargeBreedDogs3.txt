 Teach your children that they should never pet someone’s dog without permission. When approaching someone else’s dog – even if it is one they are familiar with – there is a risk that the pet may react territorially and aggressively. Instruct your kids to always ask for permission and approach the dog cautiously before petting it.When approaching the dog, your child should curl their hand into a closed fist with the back of their hand facing upward. They should then slowly extend their hand towards the dog and allow it to sniff the back of their hand. This will help the dog process their smell and better familiarize itself with your child., Do not let your children wrestle or roughhouse with the dog. This can get it excited and lead to a bite. Teach them to play with the dog gently and in a non-aggressive way.Encourage your children to play games like fetch that exercise the dog and promote positive socialization.
 Teach your kids that they should never tease, hurt, or startle the dog. These actions could lead to the dog reacting aggressively towards them and hurting them. You should also instruct them to avoid approaching the dog if it is eating or has a toy. This may trigger its territorial instincts and result in a bite.Even a well-trained dog will react aggressively to being hurt or scared.
 A dog’s body language is a great indicator of its mood. A dog that is growling or has raised hairs on its back is feeling defensive and may strike. In addition, if a dog is moving away from you, it is likely feeling anxious or agitated. Unfortunately, children will often chase after an anxious dog, resulting in a bite.Let your children know that, if the dog moves away from them, they should give it some space.

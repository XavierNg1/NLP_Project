 When it comes time to picking activities, you need to largely consider what your partner likes to do. While it’s okay to plan some activities that you want to do, your goal should be planning activities that your partner and you will enjoy together. To accomplish this:Reflect on what your partner likes and doesn’t like.
If they know about the trip, ask them what they’d like to do.
If the trip will be a surprise, consider asking their friends or family what they might want to do.
 Ask the ranger or locals about beautiful and scenic places to hike. Then, set out with plenty of fluids and snacks for a romantic hike. Feel free to take it easy and enjoy the sights.


Hike down the beach around sunset.
Hike to a mountain vista late in the afternoon so you can enjoy the sunset over the mountains.
 Wherever you go, its likely you’ll be in proximity to a body of water where you can canoe or kayak. Depending on the setting, this could potentially be a very romantic activity.


Consider canoeing together. This way, you’ll be in the same boat, have to cooperate, and can stop whenever you want to chat, hold hands, or have a picnic on the water.
 Build yourself a nice small fire. Set up your camp chairs or sit together on a blanket. Choose an appropriate beverage, and enjoy the warm glow of your camp fire.


Play songs on your iPhone or another portable device or even sing together.
Use the opportunity to roast marshmallows or make some s'mores.
 Lay back in your sleeping bags outside of the tent and enjoy the stars. Talk about your lives, your love, and your plans. Let the conversation wander and don’t be afraid to express how you feel about your partner.
 There’s nothing more romantic than sleeping in with your partner, waking up, and snuggling for a while. You can also use this opportunity to watch wildlife or the sun rise. The most important thing, though, is to relax and take your time. Enjoy every moment of this slow morning.

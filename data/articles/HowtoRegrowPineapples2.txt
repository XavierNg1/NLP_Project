In 1-5 days, the pineapple stem should grow roots., Do not touch the roots, as you could damage them or make them fall off., If some/most of the leaves on the stem turn brown, cut them off (this doesn't hurt the plant as long as you don't cut the green part of the leaves. It also helps prevent mold), Prepare to plant the pineapple. Don't rush the pineapple; give it at least a few weeks before planting.

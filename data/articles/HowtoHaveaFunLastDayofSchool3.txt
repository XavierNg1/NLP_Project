 You and your friends could prepare a dance or a song to do for the class. Prepare something quick and try to schedule the performance during lunch. Teachers usually won't mind if you all sing a goodbye song. Don't be afraid!


Research a popular song and learn any of the accompanying dance moves. Invent new ones if there isn't a dance for the song yet. Perform the dance for anyone who is interested!
If you and your friends love a particular movie or T.V. show, memorize a scene from it and then perform for other friends who also like the movie or T.V. show.
 It's important to stay focused if you have tests or additional assignments to complete on the last day of class. Despite all the fun you might be having, complete everything to the best of your ability.


If you are easily distracted by your cell phone, turn it off or put somewhere far away from where it might distract you.
Think about the summer break and how much free time you will have soon. This will make even the most boring of classes seem exciting all of the sudden.
Remember not to complain; the more you do, the longer the school day will take.

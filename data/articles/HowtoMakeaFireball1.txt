 To start making your fireball from a cotton ball, first pour around ¼ cup (60 ml) of rubbing alcohol into a small bowl. Keep in mind that higher concentrations of rubbing alcohol make a larger and hotter flame, while lower concentrations make a flame that is not as hot but is easier to hold.70% rubbing alcohol is a high concentration. If you can’t find a lower concentration, dilute it to make a mixture that is one part water, 2 parts 70% rubbing alcohol.;
, Place one cotton ball in the bowl of rubbing alcohol, turning it over to soak the entire ball in the liquid. Wear disposable gloves or kitchen gloves if you have them so that the rubbing alcohol does not get directly on your hands., After soaking the cotton ball in the rubbing alcohol, take the cotton ball out of the bowl and squeeze it to release excess alcohol. This ensures that the cotton ball won’t drip rubbing alcohol, which is dangerous when you set it the cotton ball on fire., If you are handling the cotton ball with your bare hands, set the cotton ball down on a plate or counter. Wash you hands with soap and water and dry them to remove traces of rubbing alcohol. If your clothing got splashed by the rubbing alcohol, change any garments that have the alcohol on them as an extra safety precaution.If you did use gloves to soak the cotton ball in the rubbing alcohol, take off the gloves, making sure not to transfer the rubbing alcohol to your hands.
Your cotton ball is now ready to be set aflame!

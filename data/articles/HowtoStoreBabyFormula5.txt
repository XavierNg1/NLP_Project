 The contents may have come in contact with the steel if the tin layer inside the container has been cracked. Rusting or spoilage is always a possibility when damage to the container is evident.
 Toss all expired formula out to prevent anyone from accidentally feeding it to your baby. If it is an unopened canister, try returning it to the store you purchased it from and ask to replace it with an up-to-date canister.
 The process can lead to the separation of the fat and protein content.
 Avoid leaving prepared formula to sit at room temperature for more than one hour. Room temperature is a perfect breeding ground for bacteria.
 Avoid microwaving a bottle of formula to warm it up, because to do so may leave hot spots that can cause serious burns to your babyâ€™s mouth or throat.


Refrain from placing a bottle of formula in a pan that is heating on the stove. Always remove the pan from the stove before placing the bottle in the pan.
 Avoid using a dish towel to dry any of the items that are used for feeding, as bacteria may be harboring in the towel. Use clean paper towels or air dry instead.
 Remember to store formula bottles in an insulated bag or a cooler full of ice to prevent bacteria growth when out and about.
 Potential contamination does occasionally occur and awareness is vital to prevent offering it your baby. If you did feed your baby any recalled formula, be sure to arrange for her to be seen by her health care provider promptly.

You may give a humorous remark about what it does or does not mean.
Use a starting point related to a scripture or an event that was/is the impetus for the main idea.;
, and alternatives, or what the different events might be.


Since you gave the concept to be developed in the introduction, then you and the class or congregation know what you are talking about, and you know upon what you will make a conclusion.
Develop your main points with examples like a story or two, Biblical parables, part of a song, church events or such that you can weave into the topic.
You may realize that there would be objections in your topic like:

"What do you mean?"
"How did that happen?"
"What if ______________ (name something) happened?"


And so, ask those as "rhetorical" questions (not to seek an answer from the audience, unless it's a small group), and answer them like:
"What if _________ (something) happened? Well, then ____________ (this) is what you or someone can do because ___________ (whatever), but then..." (fill in the blanks beforehand) -- and so you would answer the objections or questions for them. If you do allow answers, wait for it... as in a class room; don't disagree with the answer unless it is important to say why "Actually, I feel like this is the answer: _______" (giving your view). Generally, suspend judgment so you neither praise nor ignore comments, and you can nod and say one or a few words in response "I see.", while nodding agreeably, "Okay.", "I see your point." or "Thank you." or such a non-judgmental remark -- and then steer it onto the path it was supposed to be on (without characterizing the comment as right or wrong).
 Perhaps this would be a call to accept Jesus as Savior. This is putting the finish on what you introduced and developed--such as to remember to try the ideas, pray, invite others, or study, etc.


This is like an assignment to do the things that you taught or preached about.

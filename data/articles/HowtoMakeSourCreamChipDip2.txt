 First, peel and mince a fresh onion (or two, if needed) for a total of 1 cup’s worth (160 g). Then coat a large skillet with canola, grapeseed, or another neutral cooking oil. Set the skillet on a burner and turn the burner up to medium-high. Give it a couple of minutes to heat up.If you’re going to be making this a lot, consider using ⅔ cup (158 ml) of oil. Once your onion has cooked and flavored the oil, you can reuse the oil later on for extra flavor.
 Add your minced onion to the skillet. Then add ¼ teaspoon of salt and ½ teaspoon of sugar and stir them all together. Continue to stir periodically. Saute them for about ten minutes, or until the onion begins to brown., While your onion cooks, measure 16 ounces (454 g) of sour cream into a mixing bowl. Once your onion has browned, transfer it to the mixing bowl (or a fine strainer to drain first, in case you used a lot of oil). Mix the onion into the cream with a serving spoon, and you’re good to go.

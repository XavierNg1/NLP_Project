 Speed up your tempo only after you are comfortable playing rudiments at a slower pace.;
, Because keeping solid time is so integral to playing drums, a metronome is a necessary component to at least a portion of any practice session.
 Listening to music you are unfamiliar with can also help ease you into a new style.
 Most professional drummers who get hired for studio work have a "toolbox" of drumming styles that they can draw from, which might include jazz, rock, funk, bossa nova, rockabilly, salsa, samba, or blues beats.
 Instead of jumping ahead to learn new drumbeats every week, work through the styles you already know and practice them to perfection. Practice every song or beat until you can play it comfortably and confidently.
 The lack of bounce you feel when you strike a pillow with a drumstick forces your wrists to work harder, which will benefit you when you play on an actual drum.

 Many states or countries are able to deliver a passport within 6 weeks, but it could take up to 3 months. Check to see if the countries you are visiting require a visa for citizens of your country, because some visas take even longer to apply for and receive.
 These are often known as "commission stops," because the company or tour director receives a portion of the money from the goods sold.
 This is a personal preference, so quiz your tour contact before making a decision. They should be able to tell you if your day is completely planned out, or if you have afternoons or whole days free.
 In Europe, this is usually between September and June of the next year. Take into account that the weather during these months can be less desirable, which can be a barrier to people with limited mobility.
 Most tour companies book your travel, but you can ask them to list you as being disabled or needing aid. If you do not see that listed on your ticket, visit the counter on the day of travel to have it added to your boarding pass.
 Europe runs on the Euro, so check the most updated transfer equivalent. You can exchange a small amount at the bank, and then use an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) to take out the rest once you get there.


Using an ATM has the advantage of giving you the current day's exchange rate. A small percentage is usually charged by the bank every time you take money out. However, you should not try to take all your money out at once, in case of theft or pick-pocketing. Try to strike a good balance for taking out money every few days or every week.
 Pack lightly, and plan to wear many of your clothes more than once. This will allow you to take a smaller, more manageable suitcase, and you will leave room for souvenirs.
 If the company you are traveling with does not provide a good plan, then find one yourself. It should include an emergency evacuation, medical care and anything that can help with chronic health conditions.

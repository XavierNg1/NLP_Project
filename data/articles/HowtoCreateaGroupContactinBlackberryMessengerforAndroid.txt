 This will take you to the Group list section.
 On the Create Group page, all you need to put is the Group name and you can already create a group. You can add more information about the group by adding description.


Allow Members to Invite Others – By default, this option is set to “ON”. This means that the members you've invited can also invite other people. Set this option to “OFF” if you want to be the only person who can invite members to the group.
 Here you can start a chat with the group, add pictures, lists, and events, and invite more members.
 Here, you can now see the group you've just created.

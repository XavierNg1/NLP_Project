The sooner you actively recall what happened, the more accurate your memory will be., Try to remember everything as it happened. Where did you go? What did it look like? What sensations did you feel? Write all of these details down in a dream journal. Record every detail that you can remember., It may help your memory and understanding if you sketch a picture of the scene to help you place details more vividly. Use colors to express the scenery. Include where you were in the scene. Where were you when the OBE started? Where did it take you? This creative exercise can help you process what happened.
 What you were doing just before the OBE occurred may be able to help you identify what type of OBE it is. Try to identify what happened beforehand to understand why it might have happened.

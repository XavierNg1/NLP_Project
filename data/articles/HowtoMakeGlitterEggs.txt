 Will you fill a bowl with just the glitter eggs or will you use them to enhance a centerpiece? Also, consider how many centerpieces you will create (which will dictate the number of eggs you’ll need).;
, Also, if you want to use real eggs plan to hard boil them before you cover them with glitter.


Consider what type of material you will use if you plan to glitter fake eggs. The type of material you use may end up dictating the type of adhesive spray or glue you will use to cover the egg with glitter.
 If you plan to use fake eggs, you can most likely purchase eggs at the craft store. Otherwise purchase real eggs at your local grocer.


Purchase adhesive spray. For most applications, Mod Podge or spray adhesive will allow the glitter to hold nicely to the egg. You may want to experiment if you aren’t sure. Purchase a paintbrush to apply the Mod Podge.
Buy glitter. Make sure you purchase enough to cover (and possibly) re-cover every egg.
 You’ll need newsprint to cover and protect a clean surface, a paper plate to hold residual glitter and an area to allow your eggs to sit and dry .
 Cover workspace with newsprint and open and assemble your supplies. If needed, transfer glitter to a small bowl.
 If you’ve hard boiled the egg, make sure it is free of water and has cooled and dried completely.
 Make sure you completely cover that one side, using a paint brush if you are using Mod Podge.
 Make sure you “over” cover the egg so that the glitter fills every area.
 Make sure you allow ample time for the egg to dry completely.

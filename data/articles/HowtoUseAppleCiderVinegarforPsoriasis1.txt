Dampen a washcloth with warm water to use as a compress.
Make a solution of apple cider vinegar and warm water. Mix 1 part vinegar with 3 parts water.
Use the warm washcloth as a compress. Apply the ACV solution directly to the affected areas and hold the compress on the skin for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Apply several times a day as needed for itching. ACV makes the pH levels in the skin more acidic, thus reducing irritation.;
, Many people with psoriasis find that their toenails and fingernails become affected. To treat these areas, soak them in a bowl of ACV for 5 minutes daily.
 For itchy patches or legions, saturate a cotton ball with pure ACV and apply to affected areas. Leave the treatment overnight and shower off in the morning.

 Before you begin contouring, you will need a smooth canvas to work from. An exfoliating scrub will remove dead skin cells, leaving you with smooth, clean, blemish-free legs., Smooth some of your favorite lotion onto your legs. Moisturized legs will be much easier to work with than dry dusty ones. The smooth, satiny finish will also catch natural highlights better, creating a lengthening effect of its own., Follow the directions on the bottle of your self-tanner of choice. Spread only a thin layer over your legs, focusing on areas near muscles and joints. Use an applicator mitt to perform this step in order to get an even finish and reduce staining your hands.


For a less permanent contour, you can use bronzer or a slightly darker foundation instead of self-tanner. When using this type of makeup, be sure to blend it into your skin well with your fingers using small circular motions., Select a second moisturizer containing a lightening shimmer. Apply it to where light would naturally hit your legs: along the shins, down the center of your thighs, and around your calf muscles.

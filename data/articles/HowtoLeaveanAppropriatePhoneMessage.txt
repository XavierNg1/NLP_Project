 It may take a few minutes, but don't skip it. You won't believe the difference it makes.;
, Be friendly, polite, and succinct, and make sure you get right to the point.
 If you don't like the way it sounds, you can always change it.
 Make sure there isn't any background noise (turn off music, any loud appliances, etc.).
 You can still follow the outline of your message if it helps.
 Make sure you don't whisper, ramble, pause unnecessarily, or add words like uh, you know, um, like... you get it. Don't scream, but speak loudly and clearly, and enunciate. Remember the overall impression that you leave with your message. Your tone can be very important, the reaction of who you called may vary depending on your tone of voice. Such as: If you sound sad, the person may not call you back or will call back being sympathetic or even prying to find what was wrong. This can be annoying, especially if nothing was wrong. Try to sound as normal as possible.
 At the end of your message, consider adding something along the lines of "Hope to see you soon," or "Have a great day."

 The handles, if you added them, will be on the bench. You want the other long edge (12-1/2") facing upwards. Lay 4-5 of the slats on top and adjust the ends so that they are the right distance away. The ends of the slats should be flush with the outside edges of the end pieces.
 This will make up the bottom of your crate. Start with the slat closest to the end so that you're making the corner of the box first.
 The glue is there to help you get the slat in position and keep it in place as you hammer. You'll need nails to make the crate sturdy. Thin, 1" brad nails work well. Two in each end of each slat should do it.









If you don't want to use nails, a thin screw or heavy-duty wood glue may also work., Add a little glue, adhere the slat, then nail it in. Start with the other end to make the other corner, then work inward. You should have five slats total on the bottom of the crate.
 Use your last eight slats to finish the crate up. Turn it on its side and attach four slats to each side, spacing them however you'd like. When you're done, let the wood-glue dry overnight.
 If you want a professional looking crate, get some stain out or paint the sides. You could use a wood burning kit to etch a design in as well. No matter how you choose to decorate your crate, make sure you wait a day for the glue to dry and the crate to settle before proceeding.

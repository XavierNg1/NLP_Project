 These can sometimes be found in towns, but are more commonly found in cities. If you're still having trouble finding one, talk to a guard, choose "Profession Trainer" and then "Enchanting".;
,, You should now see a button to bring up the enchantments you can make, and another to disenchant things.
,, Know that once you disenchant the item is destroyed forever., You have now taken the first footsteps of becoming a master enchanter., In order to actually create enchantments though, you will need to purchase a Copper Rod from a vendor next to the trainer, (the vendor will have <Enchanting Supplies> under their name).








You will also need a Lesser Magic Essence and Strange Dust from disenchanting items.
Open up the enchanting list from your professions tab and then choose the Runed Copper Rod and create it.






You are now able to create enchantments!

 Earwax candles are little more than hollow paper tubes lined with wax. Supposedly, when one end is lit and the other is placed in your ear, the candle will draw out earwax via a vacuum effect. If this all sounds a bit far-fetched to you, rest assured that science agrees with you.Plainly stated, there is no reliable evidence that these candles work in the least, and ample evidence that they can cause burns, fires, and punctured eardrums.
 If you want to try to loosen and drain out excess earwax yourself by introducing a liquid, pick a safe option like salt water, baby oil, or (especially) mineral oil. Commercial earwax cleaning solutions are also available for purchase.Other DIY methods you can find online may carry unnecessary risks. Pouring hydrogen peroxide in your ear, for instance, can cause serious irritation, or even greater damage if you have a perforated eardrum.
Ask your doctor about using a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution. This can be a great option for loosening and draining excess earwax if your doctor advises that it's safe for you to try., Whether you are using mineral oil or another option, warm the liquid to body temperature before introducing it into your ear. Liquids that are too cool can disrupt the workings of your inner ear, potentially leading to loss of balance, dizziness, and nausea. Liquids that are too hot can cause irritation or even burns., Add just a few drops of body-temperature mineral oil (or other safe liquid) into your ear canal, using either a medicine dropper or a moistened cotton ball.Lie on your side, with the gunked-up ear facing up.
Instead of trying to force or flush out excess earwax on or near your eardrum, you might be able to soften it up and encourage it to flow out. The process should be painless and can even be relaxing.
 Remain in position for ten to twenty minutes, or even a bit longer if desired. Then, roll over onto a clean towel and allow the liquid and the loosened wax to drain out.

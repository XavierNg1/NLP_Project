 The Olsen's no longer wear pastels and pinks. They are often seen in neutral tones such as tans and beige which make them look more mature and sophisticated.
 The Olsen twins love layering dresses and sweaters and blazers and scarves. Mary-Kate loves to go more bohemian with baggy layers like wrap dresses, flowing skirts and shawls. Ashley may keep it more fitted with button up shirts and blazers.
 They wear scarves with casual and dressy outfits. The scarves are usually light and flowing. They will add a splash of color with a bright scarf with more subdued outfits.
 They love to wear skinny jeans in darker denims, especially Ashley who sometimes goes for a more fitted look.
 They like broaches, pendent necklaces and earrings that are reminiscent of times past. Mary-Kate especially likes wearing multiple bracelets.
 Her clothes are reminiscent of hippie times often combining designer wear with second-hand thrift store goods.

 Good choices include pelargonium (scented geranium), lavender, pansies, mint, thyme, lemon balm, mint, rosemary, bay leaves, violets, etc. When picking them, ensure that you keep a little stem on each one to help keep its place in the tussie mussie.;
, Arrange the various herbs in a circular way around the flower. Try to maintain each herb at an even level with each other herb. Let the stems stick out downwards to form one stem or holding point.


If wished, arrange the leaves and flowers on a foil doily to help create the circular shape and keep everything in place. If doing this, make a small hole in the middle of the doily to allow the stems to poke through.
 At this point, decide whether you'd like to add another layer of herbs to build up the tussie mussie. If so, add the layer and tie again with another rubber band.
 This completes the tussie mussie, although it's a good idea to trim the stems to ensure that the base is even.

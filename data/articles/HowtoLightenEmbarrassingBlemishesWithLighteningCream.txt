 The first step in getting the best results out of a lightening formula is to choose a well-trusted product. A good product should not contain harmful lightening ingredients like hydroquinone and mercury. It should also treat existing discolorations while preventing melanin production.;
, Apply a bit of the cream under the ear, on the arm or on any other cover-able patch of skin and observe for 48 hours. If no inflammation or irritation occurs, it means the product is probably safe for you.
 Consistency is crucial when using lightening creams. Some blemishes can take longer to even out, so it's important to follow the instructions indicated on the product label or leaflet. You may start seeing results as early as 2 weeks or as long as 6 weeks or more, depending on the degree of discoloration on your skin and the power of your product.
 Avoid applying lightening cream on non-dark areas. The point is to even out the blemishes, not to make the rest of your skin lighter than it already is.
 Lightening parts the skin may cause over drying, especially for people with extra-sensitive or excessively dry skin. This is why moisturizing is recommended once youâ€™re done using the lightening bleaching cream. You may apply an all-natural skin moisturizer or use Vitamin E oil to seal in moisture.
 When spot lightening, avoid the outdoors after applying cream to parts of the body that are usually exposed, especially the face. Many skin blemishes are the result of excessive sun exposure. Use sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor of at least 15 when venturing out, especially after you've just applied lightening formula on your skin.

 These are sometimes called "sweet almonds.";
,, The soaking process makes the almonds soft enough to juice. Trying to juice raw, unsoaked almonds can break a juicer.
 Make sure you rinse until the water runs clear.
 If you are making a bigger batch, use a 1 to 3 ratio of almonds to water.
 If you have blade attachments, insert one that is meant for small pieces of food. Make sure you have the juice and waste receptacles attached securely in order to reduce mess.
, Pour it carefully into the top of the juicer.
 Stop when the juice receptacle is full. The milk should be frothy.


If you do not have a juicer that extracts pulp, then strain the resulting almond milk through a cheesecloth. Place cheesecloth securely over a bowl or large jar and slowly pour the juice through the jar. Pulp will collect on the top of the cheesecloth.
 This is an optional step, as plain almond milk is slightly sweet. You may prefer it sweetened, if you are used to store-bought versions.


Sweeten the milk with honey, agave nectar, cane sugar or maple syrup to taste. Stir the sweetener in, starting with 1 tsp. (4.9 ml) and continuing until you get the right taste.
Add 1 tsp. (4.9 ml) of vanilla extract to create vanilla almond milk.
Add 1 tbsp. (6 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder to create chocolate almond milk.
 Place them in the refrigerator as soon as possible. Fresh almond milk can be stored for 2 to 3 days.

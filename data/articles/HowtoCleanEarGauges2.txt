 Anytime you receive a new piercing--or move to a larger size gauge--it is important to refrain from touching the area for at least 24 hours. After this, you will need to clean the area several times a day. Before touching your piercings it is important to wash your hands with hot water and soap.
 Your fresh ear piercing may accumulate some dried skin or other crust. With clean hands, moisten a cotton swab with water and use it to carefully removed any dried matter from the front and back of each piercing., Once the dry matter has been removed, lather a drop of unscented antibacterial soap and water, and work this around each piercing (front and back). Rinse each piercing with cool water and dry them with a clean paper towel.Do this at least once, but not more than twice per day.
 In addition to cleansing with antibacterial soap, you may want to perform a salt water soak. In order to do this, moisten a clean cotton ball with saline solution, and press it up to your ear piercing.You can do this for 10 minutes at a time, 2-3 times per day.
Perform a salt water soak if your piercing feels swollen, irritated, or otherwise painful.
Use this practice sparingly with bone, stone, or wooden jewelry.
 A piercing is essentially an open wound, and as such, is prone to infection. You can prevent infections in your ear piercings by avoiding risky activities. For at least 3 weeks after getting a new piercing (or sizing up your gauges), avoid:


Removing or changing jewelry
Saunas, swimming pools, lakes, and other bodies of water
Wearing hats or dirty clothes
Touching the piercing unnecessarily
Touching the piercing with dirty hands

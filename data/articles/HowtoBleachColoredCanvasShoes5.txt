 You don't have to bleach your shoes all the way; you can paint or draw designs onto them as well. Here's a list of what you will need:Canvas sneakers
Bowl
Bleach
Small, cheap, stiff-bristled paintbrush
Bleach pen (optional)

, Once you start drawing on your shoes, it will be impossible to erase the bleach. Get out a piece of paper and a pen or pencil, and sketch out your design.
 This will allow you to see where you are drawing and keep you from making mistakes.
 Make sure that the bristles are stiff and made of plastic. If the bristles are too soft, they won't hold the bleach. If they are made of natural fibers, such as boar bristle, sable, or camel hair, the bleach will eat through them.You can also use a bleach pen, although some people find those difficult to control. Consider testing the bleach pen out on some scrap fabric first.
 The bleach won't work at first, but after a while, you should see the colors start to fade. It will take about an hour or so.


Keep in mind that some designs won't fade completely to white. If you want really white designs, you may want to try drawing them with a white, opaque fabric pen instead.
 This will stop the bleach from acting, and prevent it from deteriorating the fabric.

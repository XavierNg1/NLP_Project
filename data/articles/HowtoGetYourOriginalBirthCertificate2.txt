 If your parents were traveling abroad or serving in the military when you were born, they should have received a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (FS-240) from the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in that country. Requests for copies of these reports are handled by the U.S. Department of State.This is a relatively lengthy process, so be prepared to wait four to six weeks for your replacement.If your parents were serving in the military and did not go through this process, you might need to contact the hospital where you were born, the operator of the base where they were stationed, or the public affairs office for the branch of the military in which they were serving.
 Before you submit your request, make sure you have all of the facts that you will need, including the following:Your full name at birth

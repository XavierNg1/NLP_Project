 Sewing a button on in place of a missing button is another easy way to replace a missing jeans button. To sew on a button, you will need:

Replacement button
Needle
Thread (use a heavy duty or denim thread)
Scissors
Small denim patch (optional)

, Insert the thread through the needle’s eye. Pull the thread through the eye so that about 18 inches of thread is hanging from the eye. Then, snip the thread to make the pieces even.You can buy pre-threaded needles if you don’t want to bother with threading a needle.
 If your jeans are still intact where the old button was located, then you may not need to use a denim patch. However, if there is a gap, then adding a patch can help to stabilize the new thread.

The patch does not need to be very big. Just large enough to cover the area behind where the button will go.
You may iron on the patch if it has adhesive on the back, but this is not necessary. The thread will hold the patch in place.
 Insert the thread through the back of the jeans where you have positioned the denim patch. Sew through the patch and the jeans a few times to secure the thread. Then, insert the needle through the button on the front side of the jeans. Next, push the needle back through the denim and patch.

Continue to insert the needle through the button and back through the jeans several times until the button is secure. Then, snip the excess thread and tie it in a knot to help keep it secure.

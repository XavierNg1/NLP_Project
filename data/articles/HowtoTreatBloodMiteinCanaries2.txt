 Toss out all padding and bedding in the cage. Remove as many separate parts of the housing as you can. You will be cleaning these separately. Since mites like to crawl around in the small nooks of the cage, you will more successfully eliminate the infestation by dismantling the cage and cleaning each part separately., Dilute 1/4 cup of bleach in a gallon of warm water. Wear gloves as you scrub down each part of your bird’s housing or cage. Rinse afterwards with fresh water.Alternatively, if you have access to a power washer, you can spray down each part.


Don’t neglect the small cracks and grooves. These are where mites like to live. Scrub down into these parts.
 Use an insecticide that is safe for birds. You can use the same spray you used on your bird. Spray down each part individually, and make sure that it reaches the dark cracks and holes.
 You can leave the cage outside to dry for a day or two. After it is dry, check it over carefully for any more signs of mites. Do not place the birds into this cage until they have been fully treated for the mites living in their feathers, or you will risk starting another infestation.
 This may be a small or a large job, depending on the size of your canaries' home, but it is very important to prevent future infestations. Use gap filling agents or sand down these areas. Paint with bird-safe paint once you have finished.
 Once you are certain that the infestation has been completely eliminated, you can return the birds back to their original cage. Wait until you are certain that all of the mites on the bird have been treated; this may take up to a week. Once you have returned the canaries to their original cage, clean the secondary cage in the same manner to fully ensure that all of the mites have been killed.

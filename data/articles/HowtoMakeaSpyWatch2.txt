 Grab the band near the watch face with a pair of pliers, and twist until it separates from the watch. Repeat for the other side.


Some watch bands can be removed by pushing down on the attached bar using a spring bar tool, or by removing small pins with a jeweler's screwdriver or tweezers.Cheap watches usually don't have this option.
Choose a watch with a band that has plenty of extra room.
 Find two bottle caps of the same size, roughly as large as your watch face. Tape them together on one side using a single piece of duct tape. This is the container you will hide under your watch.


Shallow bottle caps will be less noticeable, but larger ones allow you to store more objects.
Black duct tape will be less noticeable.
 Use more duct tape to attach the side of the bottle caps underneath the watch face. Make sure not to tape the bottle caps together â€“ you should still be able to open them.
 You may have to use several pieces of duct tape to make sure the bottle cap stays in place.
 Cover the duct tape with ordinary black tape for best results. If you don't have black tape, color the duct tape with black nail polish. Permanent marker might work, but is easily rubbed off.

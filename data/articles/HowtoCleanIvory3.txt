 If dirt and other impurities are still ingrained in your ivory, you will need to clean your object with an ethyl alcohol solution. To create the solution, combine equal parts water and ethyl alcohol in a small bowl and stir to mix.


Keep in mind that this is the most aggressive cleaning method, and should only be used on ivory that does not have any fissures or cracks.
 After you make the ethyl alcohol solution, dip a Q-tip or a cotton ball into the liquid. Squeeze out any excess, then use a paper towel to blot the Q-tip or cotton ball., Ethyl alcohol is a potent cleaner, so you want to be sure to test clean an area of the object before using it on the entire object. Pick out an inconspicuous section of the ivory, then gently rub the ivory with the cotton ball or Q-tip. Dry the area with a small cloth. If there is no discoloration, you will know that the ethyl alcohol solution is safe to use., If the spot test went well, clean the ivory object section by section by rubbing the barely-dampened Q-tip or cotton ball on the surface of the ivory. Make sure to dry every section if necessary before moving on to the next one. Work in small patches until you have cleaned the entire object.
 Once you are done cleaning the object, wipe it down with a clean, white cloth. This will soak up any excess moisture that could damage the surface of the ivory.

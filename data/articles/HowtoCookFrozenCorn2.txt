 You will need at least 1 inch of water in the bottom of the steamer so that you do not risk burning or damaging your pan. However, you want to make sure that the water is low enough so that no liquid, only steam, will be cooking the corn. Place the steamer over high heat until boiling, then reduce to a simmer.
 Place the frozen corn in a steaming basket or sieve before placing the sieve into the steamer. Add any seasoning you would like, this could be fresh herbs, spices, or simply salt and pepper.


You may need to run the frozen corn, while still in the bag, under warm water to reduce clumping.
 Place the sieve or steaming basket into the steamer, place the lid on top of it, and steam the corn until it is tender, which should approximately 3-5 minutes. Check the corn after the initial cooking time to make sure that it is properly cooked.Check to see if your steamer has enough water left, no less than 1 inch, before steaming your corn.
 Once tender, remove the steamer or sieve and gently shake over the sink. You can pour out the contents of the steamers into a bowl or onto a plate and continue seasoning.

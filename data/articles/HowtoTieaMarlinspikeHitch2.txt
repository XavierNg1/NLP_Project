 Traditionally, marlinespike hitches are used to get a good grip on a rope. Instead of wrapping the rope around your hand and pulling, you create a handle with a wrench, dowel, etc. Since the knot is so quick and easy to make, you'll save a lot of time and energy for serious pulling, towing, or yanking.


The knot is even used to tie other knots tighter. Instead of yanking on the end of a knot with your hands, tie in a marline spike, tighten the knot, and then remove it.
 This is especially helpful at sea, where there is an abundance of rope but a serious risk of tools going overboard. Keep them secure and at an easily grabbed height with a marlinespike., If you have two identical ropes hanging down, you can make marlinespike hitches at identical heights to create a rope ladder. The actual knots are the exact same, but you should test each set with a vigorous pull to ensure they are all weight bearing. Note, however, that You must start from the bottom up. The final hitch you tie needs to be your top rung for the greatest strength and durability.


Test the ladder every time you use it. Over time, all knots may loose some of their strength and start to become loose.
Secure the rungs, especially the top ones, with clamps that prevent the rungs from falling off for longevity and added safety.
Ensure that your rungs are as horizontal as possible, with evenly spaced rungs.

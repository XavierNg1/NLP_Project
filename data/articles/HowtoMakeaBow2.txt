 Using scissors, cut the ribbon to your desired length.


When starting out, leave your ribbon a little longer. It will be easier to practice with.
 Hold the ends of the ribbon, one end in each hand. Keep the ribbon from twisting, and fold the ribbon back to front.You should end up holding the ribbon with two loops towards the top and one larger loop at the bottom's center.
 Cross the top right loop over the top left loop.


If you're making a bow to wrap a box, cross the top left loop over the right and do a half-knot. This will keep it in place on the box., Fold the right loop behind and underneath the left loop. Pull it up through the hole.Don't let the ribbon get twisted or bunched as you knot the loops.
 Hold the ends or tails of the bow and pull to tighten. This should make a smooth knot.Make sure both your loops are the same size. If not, pull to adjust them. You can also trim the bow's tails by cutting a little chevron out of the ends.

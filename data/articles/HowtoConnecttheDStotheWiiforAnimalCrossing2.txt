 In order to visit a friend’s town on the DS, you will need to walk to your town gate and talk to Copper, the dog. Talk to him by pressing “A” and then choose the option “I wanna go out!”, Copper will ask if you want to do this via a Nintendo Wi-Fi connection or by DS suitcase; choose DS suitcase., Do this by pressing the Power button located in the bottom right and tap on the “Download Play” panel from the DS menu (which boots up automatically upon turning the device on).

If you haven’t already, download the DS suitcase.
 Close the DS without turning it off so that it remains in Sleep mode., In order to visit your friend’s town, you will need to take your DS to their Wii. Turn on your friend’s Wii with Animal Crossing: City Folk in the game tray., When Rover appears to start the game, select “DS Suitcase” as opposed to proceeding as usual by choosing “Yeah!”, Open your DS back up and choose “Connect to the Wii” in order to transfer your data.

Essentially, the DS has functioned as the middleman carrying your City Folk data from your Wii to your friend’s Wii. Once this process is complete, you are free to turn the DS off. Now, you’re free to roam around your friend’s town!
Be aware: you must return home the same way that you came (in this instance, the DS Suitcase). If you don’t, you will lose all of the bells and items you had in your inventory before leaving.

 Place a large mixing bowl in your workspace. Add the ground beef, rice, and spices to the bowl. Use your hands to combine the ingredients, making sure the spices and rice are thoroughly incorporated into the ground beef., Once the ingredients are thoroughly combined, use your hands to shape twelve meatballs. Each meatball should be roughly the size of a golf ball., Place a large skillet on the stove. Turn the burner to medium-high heat. Add the meatballs to the skillet. Cook the meatballs until they are evenly browned, turning them occasionally as they cook. This will take about 3-4 minutes., After the meatballs are browned, use a slotted spoon the remove them from the skillet. Place the meatballs on a large plate that is covered with paper towels. Allow the paper towels to absorb any excess oil for a few minutes. Drain any remaining grease from the skillet., While the meatballs are draining, add the tomato sauce, one cup (240 mL) water, and Worcestershire sauce to the skillet. Use a wooden spoon to stir the ingredients together until completely combined., Once you have combined the sauce ingredients, begin returning the meatballs to the skillet. Use the slotted spoon to gently place each meatball in the skillet. Once you have returned all the meatballs to the skillet, reduce the heat to medium-low., Place a lid on the skillet. Simmer the meatballs over medium-low heat for about 45 minutes. If the sauce becomes too dry while cooking the meatballs, add a little more water. When the meatballs are done, the rice will be tender and the meat will no longer be pink inside., Once the meatballs are cooked, turn off the stove. Allow the meatballs to cool for several minutes and then serve them over a bed of steamed white rice, with a side of cauliflower, or by themselves. Enjoy!

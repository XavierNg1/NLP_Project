 The basic drumstick spin is essential for any drummer to know. Position the middle of the drumstick low, in between your pointer and middle finger.The stick should be resting in the webbing of your two fingers.


You can use your right or left hand to practice this trick, and it will look even better when you can do it simultaneously with both hands.;
, With the stick in between your two fingers, alternate the positioning of your fingers.Your fingers should look like the legs of a swimmer, moving alternatively up and down. This up and down movement of your fingers will make the drumstick move back and forth in a pendulum-like motion.


Practice this finger movement to get accustomed to the back and forth motion of the drumstick.
The middle of the stick should remain in between your pointer and middle finger.
 As you alternate your fingers and the drumstick is moving back and forth like a pendulum, slightly roll your wrist to get some fluidity to the movement of the stick. As the stick spins, begin making a circular, figure eight motion with your fingers.


As you continue to spin the stick, it will naturally slide down to the end of the stick due to gravity. Because of this, you will have to eventually readjust the positioning of the stick.

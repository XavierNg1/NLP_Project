 This may seem silly to you, but the binder can easily get bogged down if you put more than just homework in it. Including notes, handouts, and other paper in your binder can make it easy to lose your actual homework., Your binder will only be useful to you if you actually have it at school. When you have finished all of your homework each night, place your binder in your backpack before you go to bed. This will ensure that you always have your homework with you to turn in each day.


At the end of the school day, make sure you put the binder in your backpack before you leave for the day.
 As soon as you are handed the homework, immediately put it in the binder. This way you will always know right where your homework is and how much you have to do. You also wonâ€™t lose it in your notes or other handouts.Remember to keep all unfinished assignments in the front of the binder.

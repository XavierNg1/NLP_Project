 Use multiple keywords to help reduce the number of unintended results found. Multiple keywords may hinder chances of finding the item if seller used different keywords in the listing title.
 If you are uncertain which category to choose leave this set to its default (All Categories). Click on 'Search' once a category has been chosen. If no results are found for your keywords eBay will likely suggest keywords to use. If you decide to use eBay's new keywords, click on the new keywords to redirect to a new results page. If eBay’s suggestions don’t match what you’re looking for make change the keywords and search again.
 Click any title of an item to be redirected to the item’s page. If the item wasn’t found determine if: the search needs refining, or if the keywords were too specific. If it is necessary to refine the search (i.e. too many results were found) you can use the side bar to refine the search criteria: Categories; Price: Min-Max; Seller

 An abused horse may have suffered physical abuse or neglect. Both leave scars in their own way. First off, get the horse examined by an equine vet. You will need to know the extent of any physical damage that has been done to the horse, and should have a frank discussion about the long term and ongoing cost of medication, should that be required.;
, It is likely that basic health care, such as worming, vaccination, teeth and hoof care, are lacking. The veterinarian needs to examine the horseâ€™s teeth to see if they need filing down.


The vet should also check the hooves to determine what remedial action is required to get them back into good condition.
 In addition to other physical examinations, the veterinarian may take a fecal sample away for analysis to investigate what types of worms the horse may have. He or she will also decide on appropriate worming treatments. Worming treatment will be discussed in Method 2.


In the case of a starved horse the vet can also advise on how to gradually improve the horse's body condition in the way that is least likely to induce health problems. Weight gain will be discussed in Method 3.

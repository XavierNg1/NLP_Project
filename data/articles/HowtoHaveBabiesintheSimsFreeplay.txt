 Unlike in real life, in order to have babies in the Sims Freeplay, you have to get married first. This can be done by proposing to your partner and living together. Once you're engaged, you have to keep being romantic until your relationship bar is full, then you will have the option to get married.


Developing your romantic relationship to reach “Marriage” status requires constant completion of tasks that improves your relationship with your partner.
In proposing, make sure you buy an expensive ring to avoid being rejected.
Don’t move in with someone you are not engaged with yet.;
, When you are finally husband and wife, husband and husband or wife and wife, this is the time for you to buy a crib for your home. However, you have to buy the Children's Store first! Then, simply tab the crib to produce a baby.


You will find the cribs under the Infant section of the menu.
The more expensive the crib, the faster the baby will arrive.
 To place the crib, either buy from the store or click on your inventory if you have bought directly from the children's store. Then, go to a free tile in your house and press the "Check Mark" to place.


If you are placing it next to the wall, place it so that the "roof" of the crib is facing the wall.
 When the baby finally arrives, tap the crib to customize its name, gender, and other details.
 You can add a new baby by buying another crib in Build Mode. You also need to level up to add a new Sim.


In case you have already reached the maximum Sims in your level, simply remove one from the “Create-a-Sim” menu- or, you can lower your Sim Count by moving one temporarily to another town.
Make sure that you have married Sims and have at least one adult in the house before adding a baby Sim.

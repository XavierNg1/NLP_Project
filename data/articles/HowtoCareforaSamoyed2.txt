 Depending on whether your Samoyed is a puppy or an adult, he will need to eat varying amounts several times each day. Samoyed puppies aged 2-3 months generally need to eat about one-half cup of kibble mixed with water three times a day.
Young Samoyeds are not great eaters and often have to be enticed to eat with meat juices or bacon grease added to their food.Once they reach 3 months, they typically eat dry kibble only twice each day.
Adult Samoyeds, older than 1 year, are best fed twice a day. Typical adult Samoyeds usually eat between 2 and 3 cups of premium dog food each day., Your Samoyed will live a longer and happier life if he maintains a healthy weight. If you notice your dog is putting on weight, decrease the amount youâ€™re feeding him and take him on extra walks.


If you do give your Samoyed table scraps, only give chicken or beef that has been removed from the bone., This breed has a lot of energy and can become destructive if they are bored.To counter this, your Samoyed needs daily exercise, like long walks or active yard play.They are also happy to accompany you on hikes or bike rides., This breed has strong herding instincts, from their past experience herding reindeer, so they must be in a securely fenced yard if not leashed.Your fence should be strong and at least 4 feet high, since Samoyeds can jump over fences.
Never chain your Samoyed in your yard. They can become tangled in the chain and choke to death.

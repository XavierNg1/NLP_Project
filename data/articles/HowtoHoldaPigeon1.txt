 When you are picking up a pigeon, you will be using your dominant hand to do so. You will need to hold your hand flat, keep your palm up, and have a slight gap between your index and middle fingers. This will allow you to safely and securely pick up your pigeon., Once you have your hand positioned correctly, you will need to slide it underneath the pigeon. Move your hand towards the pigeon slowly as you go to pick it up. Moving too quickly may scare it and cause it to fly away from your hand.You will move your hand towards your pigeon's side.
The pigeon should be facing the outer edge of your hand.
The pigeon's tail feather should be facing your thumb.
 Begin by moving your hand underneath your pigeon. As you do, keep a small gap between your pointer and middle fingers to allow space for your pigeon's legs. This will both support and secure the pigeon in your hand.The pigeon's legs should gently rest between your fingers.
Don't hold the legs or the pigeon too tightly.
Ideally, your pigeon will be in its cage when you try to pick it up.
 After the pigeon is in your hand and its legs are between your fingers, you can grasp the bird with your thumb. Bring your thumb down, covering the wings. Keeping its wings secure will help keep your pigeon safe and prevent it from flying away.Don't hold the wings down tightly.
The wings should rest flatly on the pigeon's back.
 After you've gotten a good hold on your pigeon, you can move it towards your body. Bringing it closer to your body will help it feel secure and will allow you to support and hold it safely.You can cup the bird with your other hand to provide even more security.
Move the pigeon slowly to avoid scaring it.

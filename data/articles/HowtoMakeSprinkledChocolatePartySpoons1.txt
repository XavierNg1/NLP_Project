 Chocolate spoons can be an added treat for adult/fancy dinner parties too so determine what kind of spoons will be appropriate for the event.;
, Even though you are going to be serving chocolate you will be enhancing these spoons with other ingredients. For example, if you are serving the chocolate spoons following a Mexican fiesta you may want to add some spice or even a slight kick to the chocolate such as a small dash of cayenne pepper. For a kids' party you could reproduce a "worm in dirt" on a smaller scale with a small gummy worm and Oreo crumbles.
 You'll need high quality chocolate (milk, dark, whiteâ€“whatever you desire), confection enhancements, cookie sheets, parchment paper and a few spatulas (to hold the spoons in place while you create them).


Take into consideration how each spoon will look with its adornments. You may not be able to fit a lot on each spoon so while shopping for confections, think mini (mini M&M's, mini jelly beans, etc.).






Find a large glass bowl at home that you will use for melting the chocolate. If you don't plan to microwave the chocolate, find a double boiler (or stackable pots to create a double boiler).

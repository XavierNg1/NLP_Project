 When the box is checked or the switch is enabled, you'll be able to access additional filters including the Time filter.
 Accept any location or other permission requests that appear. This will give Snapchat access to your device's location and enable the additional filters.

 For most users, the Time filter is enabled by default. You can add it to any photo or video Snap that you take in Snapchat.
 Tap the large, circular shutter button on the Camera screen to take a photo Snap, or press and hold it to record a video Snap.
 You'll reach the Time filter going either direction, so just start swiping until you get to the Time filter.

If the date is displayed instead, tap the date until the time appears.
After adding the time, you can add a second filter if you'd like. Hold the screen with one finger and then use another finger to continue swiping. This will cycle through the remaining filters that you can add.
You can add stickers, drawing, and text to your Snap before you send it to your friends. Tap the buttons at the top of the Snap to access different effects and editing tools.

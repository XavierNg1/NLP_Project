Set plants outdoors on the table for an hour or 2 at the beginning of the hardening off process.
Put the plants outdoors during mid-day, when the sun is at its warmest.



Set the board upright in front of the seedlings when you set plants outdoors. The board should block the wind, so make sure you position it correctly.



You don't need to protect the seedlings from a light drizzle or mist.

Keep an eye on the nighttime temperatures in your area as you transplant seedlings outdoors.
Some plants, such as onions, can handle freezing temperatures after you harden off seedlings. Other plants, such as tomatoes, will suffer if the temperature goes below 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.33 degrees Celsius).
Members of the cabbage family can handle cold temperatures but are more likely to bolt, or produce flowers and seeds, if the temperature remains cool for longer than a week. Don't let cabbages sit out in temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.44 Celsius).
Place the seedlings near a wall of your house in the evenings at first, so they will benefit from the warmth of the house. The walls will protect the seedlings from wind.



Set plants outdoors away from the walls of the house and begin to leave them out longer at night until they are spending the entire night outdoors.



Add fertilizer to the garden spot or to the container with the plants when you transfer the seedlings so that they do not go into shock. Use a diluted fertilizer when you set plants outdoors to avoid burning the plants.

 Dogs really need the exercise and they love being able to get all of their energy out this way.
 That way it's easier for them to sleep and get their rest.
, That way they get to cuddle up to you while you watch TV or play games while sitting on the couch.
 Sometimes they don't understand, and it just scares them a lot, which you don't want to do. You don't want to scare your dog as punishment, you want to gently make your dog realize what they did. This may sound silly for a dog, but you would be surprised at how much a dog can learn.
 Treat them like a human, and they can act very much like a human.
 You can cause injuries that will and make him or her sad and if you don't love your dog him or her will run away.

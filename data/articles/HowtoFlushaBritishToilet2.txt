 Sit on the toilet, use it, and then dispose of your paper. Again, if there is a trash can close at hand, this may be the best place to dispose of your paper (at least until you and this particular toilet are old friends and you have a sense of how much it can accommodate).
 Older British toilets often do not come with a lever. Instead, they have a chain, which is typically attached to the wall. , Don't pull too hard or you may snap the chain or lever at the top. If the water does not flow, or flows very slowly, you may need to try a quicker movement. Donâ€™t pull hard; just increase your speed a bit. , The toilet will continue flushing. There is no need to hold the chain down, and this may cause the toilet to malfunction. Should the toilet keep on running for more than a few minutes, flush again, and this time release the tension of the chain gently. (On a properly functioning toilet, you should be able to just let go, but older toilets may be in disrepair.)

 A researcher will search through the online materials provided by the USPTO to uncover similar inventions that have already been patented.To find a professional patent researcher, you can search online by typing “patent research company” into a web browser.


If all you want is to find a patent by number, you should attempt to retrieve it from the USPTO website. That type of search is too simple to pay a patent researcher for.
 If you hire a patent researcher to find any patents that are similar to your invention, then you should be wary of any researcher who guarantees or claims that he will find any and all patents that are similar. There are simply too many patents to go through to find everything on file that might be similar.


Instead, patent searches are done with around an 80% level of confidence. To get a higher level of confidence, many more patents would have to be reviewed, which would increase costs. To reach 100% certainty would cost millions of dollars.Also pending applications are not published until 18 months after filing, so it is impossible to find every possible patent that is similar., Typically, a professional patent search will cost $800-1000.Be wary of researchers who offer searches for substantially lower prices ($400 or less). These searches are often done by people in foreign countries with limited English skills.

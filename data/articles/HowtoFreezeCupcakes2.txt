 Before freezing the cupcakes, they must cool, to avoid the build-up of condensation and moisture in the cupcake container. The best way to cool cupcakes fully is to leave them on a wire rack for about an hour, until they are cool enough to touch and handle.


Wire racks are highly more recommended so that the air can circulate more easily around the cupcakes.This prevents the cupcakes from getting soggy on the bottom while they are cooling.
 In order to freeze frosted cupcakes, they must be frosted correctly. Consider using a frosting pipe to pipe the frosting neatly on top of the cupcakes. Add a good amount of frosting for each cupcake, as once you freeze the cupcakes, you cannot frost them again. There are a variety of frosting flavors to choose from: buttercream frosting, chocolate frosting, strawberry frosting, and cream cheese frosting.
 The container should be large enough to carry all the cupcakes you have and tall enough to prevent the cupcakes from squishing into each other.Place the cupcakes to freeze in an open container so that the frosting can freeze thoroughly, usually taking about 3-4 hours. Ensure the frosting is solid before removing it from the freezer.
 Using the same container as before, snap the lid on tightly so the cupcakes can freeze until they are ready to be eaten. Make sure the container is large enough so that the frosting does not touch the cupcakes while freezing them.
 Instead of a container, you can also freeze the cupcakes in foil. Freeze the frosted cupcakes without covering them for about 3-4 hours so the frosting can become solid. Cover each cupcake with aluminum foil carefully, taking care not to touch the frosting. Lay each covered cupcake on a cookie sheet or place them in a large Ziploc bag.

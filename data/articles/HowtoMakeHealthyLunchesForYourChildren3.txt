 Examples of foods that contain whole grains are pasta, rice, cereal, and bread. Children between 4 and 6 years of age should eat at least 6 servings of whole grains, and children between 6 and 11 should eat between 5 and 7 servings.
 For example, processed foods and sugary grains such as those found in white bread are less healthy than the grains present in whole-wheat bread.
 For example, if your children enjoy eating whole-wheat pasta, cook a box of pasta, then separate the pasta into individual serving sizes they can eat for lunch.

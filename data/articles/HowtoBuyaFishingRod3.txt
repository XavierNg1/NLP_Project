 Many fishing-centered stores and outdoor sporting goods establishments offer bonuses or commission when employees help customers with purchases. Ask the employeeâ€™s name and mention his or her helpfulness to the cashier. Even if no commission is awarded, it is a nice gesture.
 Retail outlets take cash, debit, or credit card. A few still take personal checks, but one of the first three options is favorable.
 The receipt will contain all details of the purchase, including the refund and exchange policy. Retain it in case you need to bring the fishing rod back for any number of reasons.

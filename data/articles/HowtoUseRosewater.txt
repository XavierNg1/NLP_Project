 You can make your own rosewater, or you can purchase it from specialty grocery stores. When using rosewater, always err on the side of "less is best" as it is a very intense flavour and too much of it can overwhelm. It is always easier to add more than to try to reduce the intensity of an over-seasoned dish. Note, however, that chilled or frozen foods require extra rosewater because the colder temperatures reduce the flavour intensity of the rosewater.;
, Rosewater and oranges create a superb partnership. Each one complements the other well. Some ideas include:



Rosewater baklava.

Rosewater meringues.
Sprinkle segments of orange with a few drops of rosewater. Add a dusting of fine sugar and serve chilled.
Crepes with orange slices and rosewater.
 Sorbets are an ideal medium for the addition of rosewater; consider combining in sorbets with citrus tones, refreshing apple or berry fruits.
 Fresh strawberries are already delicious but the addition of rosewater adds extra sparkle. Sprinkle over the freshly prepared strawberries and add a dusting of icing sugar.
 In a variety of dessert recipes, it might be possible to substitute a standard sugar syrup with rosewater. An especially good example of this is baklava.
 Add a few drops to your favourite butter biscuit recipe; the rosewater will delight at first bite.
 A plain rice pudding (purchased or homemade) can be transformed into an exotic dessert with the simple addition of toasted ground almonds, chopped glace fruit and a few drops of rosewater.
 After you have tried some of these ideas, you will undoubtedly have a sense of other recipes in which you can introduce rosewater to provide a subtle but delicious additional taste layer. And when you do, feel free to add them to the steps here!

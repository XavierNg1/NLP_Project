 You can generally change the beneficiary on your insurance policy whenever you want, but you should check with your life insurer to confirm if there are any limitations.For example, you might have made the original beneficiary irrevocable when you opened the policy.
If you can change, then call your life insurance company or agent and get the correct form. Make a copy for your records before submitting it.
 Each retirement plan has a different process for adding a beneficiary. You should contact your benefits advisor to ask how to add a beneficiary. Usually, you will need to complete a form.However, the retirement plan might place limits on the changes you can make after you retire and start drawing benefits.
 You can update the beneficiary on your IRA by completing the beneficiary form. You should update the form after major life events, such as marriage, divorce, or the death of a spouse.If you want to name someone other than your spouse as the beneficiary, then you should talk to an attorney or a financial advisor.
For example, if you name your estate as the beneficiary, then your heirs cannot stretch out payments as they would if they were named on the beneficiary form.
If you want young children to be your beneficiaries, then you should think about naming a trust as a beneficiary. With a trust, you can determine how much your children receive and when. In this way, you can prevent young children from mismanaging the money.

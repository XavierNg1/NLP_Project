 Changing the way you breathe in and out, combined with restricting your airflow, can induce a cough. Take in a deep, sharp breath to dry out your mouth and throat. Tighten your throat and try to exhale. Tighten your stomach and push air out while keeping your throat restricted. This can help induce a cough.;
, A huff cough is a gentle, low pressure cough that is useful for individuals who do not have the lung capacity to perform a normal cough. These include patients with cystic fibrosis or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), among others.To do a huff cough:


Slow down your breathing by exhaling for a count of 4.
Breathe in about 75% of a normal inhalation.
Shape your mouth into an O and try to keep your voice box open.
Contract your abdominal muscles to force air up through your mouth. You should make a soft “huff” sound.
Inhale a quick, shallow breath and make another “huff” sound.
 When you start making a coughing sound on purpose to simulate a cough, a real cough might follow. To do a fake cough, start by clearing your throat. Force air out of your throat by tightening your abdominal muscles and pushing air up and out of your mouth.
 Winter air is often cold and dry, and can contribute to increased coughing. Cold, dry air can eliminate water vapor from your throat and mouth, which can cause a spasm in your airway. This might make you cough, especially if you are prone to asthma.Take big, deep breaths in the cold air. Make sure the air reaches down into your lungs.

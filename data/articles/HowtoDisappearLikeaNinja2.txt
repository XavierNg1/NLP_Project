 Ninjas use the art of Genjutsu to distract others and create illusions. If you are accidentally heard while you are sneaking around, make noises like a cat or dog to cover your position. Others will think it was just an animal that made the noise and are likely to ignore you.
 Pick up a rock or stick and throw it away from you. The sound of the object hitting the ground will distract others from your position and create a distraction allowing you disappear again.
 If you are planning to hide somewhere for an extended period of time, you can bring a small mouse in a bag. If your position is almost compromised, release the mouse and people will think the mouse was the source of any disturbance and ignore your position., Ninjas use a cloud of smoke to distract their opponents and cloud their vision to allow the ninja an opportunity to escape. Impact smoke bombs can be purchased from magic shops or online magic outlets.Throw the smoke bomb on the ground between you and the person you want to hide from.
Run quickly in the opposite direction.
Hide behind an object or around an corner before the smoke dissipates.

 Failures and mistakes are inevitable, so don’t let them demoralize you. Know what is most important to you in life, and keep pursuing it no matter how many times you have to pick yourself up along the way.If doing badly at something makes you want to give up, change your thinking. Failure is just a temporary setback that all successful people experience. It’s not a reflection of your character or innate ability.
For example, instead of saying "I've failed again" you might reframe this and say "I'm one step closer to success."

, Try to find the good side of a bad situation. Focus on what you’ve learned and how you’ll do better next time. Avoid complaining or feeling sorry for yourself – that will only prevent you from moving on.Repeat affirmations, such as "This, too, shall pass" when you encounter hardships or setbacks to keep a positive, hopeful attitude.
 It’s good to have high standards for yourself, but don’t expect everything you do to be perfect. Perfectionism can make you afraid to take healthy risks, which often leads to procrastination and underachievement.Remind yourself that making mistakes isn’t just okay – it’s a necessary part of learning and growing. In fact, challenge yourself to do something "wrong" each week so you feel comfortable making mistakes.
You can spill something on your clothes or purposefully arrive to a meeting late. When you realize the fallout won't be quite as big as you feared, you learn to relax the reigns and see the benefit of mistakes.
 Track your progress and try to do a little better every day than you did the day before. Avoid comparing yourself to other people, since their circumstances may be completely different from yours.Constantly track your progress. Only compare yourself to the person you were a week ago or a month ago. If you can spot any improvements, that's what matters. If you can't, keep pushing.

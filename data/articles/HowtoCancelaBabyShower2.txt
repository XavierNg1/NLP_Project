 If you asked a caterer to provide food for your shower, let them know of the cancellation as soon as you can. Each company has a different policy—some need only a few hours’ notice, while some may need a couple of weeks. Regardless of the policy, don’t hesitate to call them and explain your situation to see if they will offer you a refund., If you were planning to host the shower at a venue other than your home, call them or drop by to explain that the shower needs to be canceled. Similar to canceling a caterer, many places will be able to sympathize with your situation and will be understanding. Just be kind and honest as you let them know that you will no longer need to use their venue.


If you already made a deposit for the venue, you can ask about a refund if needed.
 Many decorations, linens, and party favors may be able to be returned. If you purchased items that you won’t need and haven’t opened, try returning them to the store where you bought them. If the items were opened, try finding a local charity to donate them to.


Homeless shelters may find cups handy, and a charity shop, such as Salvation Army or Goodwill, will appreciate linens. If any food or drinks can’t be returned, see if you can freeze them or share them with friends.You can also try selling slightly used or opened items on eBay.

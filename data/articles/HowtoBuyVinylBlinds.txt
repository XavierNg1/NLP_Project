 Take measurements of all the windows that you will cover with vinyl blinds.


Use a tape measure to get the length of the window. Start at the top of the window, and pull the tape measure down to the bottom of the window.
Use a tape measure to get the width of the window. Start at the left of the window and pull the tape measure to the right until you get to the end of the window.;

Choose vertical blinds if you are covering a long window or a sliding door. Vertical blinds also work well in offices.
Select horizontal blinds for a softer, more modern look. Vinyl blinds that hang horizontally are used most often on windows in homes.
 Most horizontal vinyl blinds come with slats that are half an inch (1.27 cm) or 2 inches (5 cm).


Buy blinds with a larger slat width for extra privacy and to keep the sun out.
Look for a smaller slat size for more texture and style.
 Most vinyl blinds are available in a shade of white. You can find different colors to match your d√©cor and curtains, however.
 Look for vinyl blinds in your window measurements at home improvement stores such as Lowe's and Home Depot.


Check department stores, such as Target, Sears and Walmart.
Shop online for a larger selection and lower prices. You may be able to find additional options for vinyl blinds online. You can also compare prices.
 If you will be hanging the blinds yourself, make sure you understand how to do it.


Check the packaging for instructions. If you cannot find them, ask a sales associate.
 You might get the blinds home and decide you do not like them. Make sure you can bring them back.
 If you have a window that is an unusual size, you might need to have blinds made for you. Talk to an associate in a store, or check online sites such as Blinds.com.

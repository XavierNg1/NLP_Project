 The root notes are your best portals from one scale to the other, though of course they are not the only ones. The following lick shows the simplest, easiest way to get from one to the other -- you play the first five notes of the first shape to end up on the shared root of the 4th string. You can then slide two frets down to enter your second scale shape.









e|-----------------------10-12---------|
B|-------------------12-13-------------|
G|----------------9-12------------------|
D|---------7-10/12---------------------|
A|-----7-10----------------------------|
E|-8-10--------------------------------|
You can make the same slide off the very first string, too, sliding from 10 â†’ 12 and then starting the second scale shape off the 12.
 This is perhaps easiest to see in an example. Here, you again use the root notes to set up a transition, but this technique quickly gets you ready to continue down the scale, moving your whole hand effectively by using a few notes, not just one, to transition. This five note box can be repeated anywhere in the scales. Start with your first finger on the 8th fret:









A|-----------10-12---------------------|
E|-8-10/12----------------------------|
You can actually continue this same exact pattern further down the guitar, all the way to the bottom strings. This will actually reveal other pentatonic scale shapes.
 The same principle -- use the root notes, get used to the 5-note shifts -- apply when going up the scale, too. You can, and should, slide back up from the 12th fret, 4th string, for example, to the 10th fret. Many guitarists neglect playing up the scale, but practicing the inverse of your transitions is essential.









Remember to try new slides as well -- practice to play the notes and sounds that you enjoy, since there are very few "wrong" answers in music.
 This is a great way to put some intrigue and variety in your playing. While sliding from one scale to the other is slick, sometimes simply jumping up the scale to a higher, brighter version of the scale adds contrast and texture to your playing. For example, start with the low strings of the 1st form, then jump to the extra high strings of the 2nd form for a "twist" that pivots your solo to a new place.









Jumping across the board without odd pauses or missed notes takes a lot of practice, so don't expect to get it right off the bat.

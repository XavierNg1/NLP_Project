 Buy a new one for anywhere between $5 and $20 or borrow one from a friend.
 Make sure the Mac has enough space to accommodate the files you want to recover from the dead laptop; alternatively, you can hook an external hard drive up to the working Mac and simply use the Mac as a transfer system for the files.
 Make sure that the working Mac is turned off when you do this.
 This starts the computer in “Target Mode,” meaning that the working Mac will give you access to the targeted computer’s master drive in addition to its own.



If you use OS X 10.4: Turn on your computer normally, go to System Preferences > Startup Disk > Target Mode. Then, reboot your computer to start it in Target Mode.
 If the targeted drive does not appear on the desktop, the damage to your old computer is likely physical, meaning you will need professional assistance to finish the salvage. Be warned that this can be very expensive.
 Transfer them to either the working Mac or to the external hard drive by copying and pasting, clicking and dragging, etc. If you have a lot of large files (ex. songs, movies), note that the transfer could take many hours.
 The good news is that the dead computer is still physically intact and will probably work fine if you reinstall your operating system.
 You can now detach the dead computer.

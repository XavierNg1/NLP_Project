 Will you lose any friends? Will you be bullied? You should probably tell your close friend groups first perhaps individually or as a group. This will give you a more substantial backing when you come out at school and give you practice for the kinds of reactions you will get and the questions you will be asked., If you come out to them as a group they may not feel free to ask you their questions and they may feel pressured into acting a certain way. You may feel the same way when facing multiple people so start off with ones and twos and then progress on until all your friends know., This means that you don't have to come out as such, but just don't hide your bisexuality, if the occasion comes up comment on the men and women you find attractive and if you are asked don't deny it.
You can alternatively use your friends to come out, get them to spread the rumour, you'll soon find people asking you about your sexuality. This can be dangerous, as rumours tend to grow arms and legs.
Another method could be to change your status on Facebook, but bare in mind your family and anyone else on the internet can see this so it isn't recommended.
You can allow some of your conversations with friends to be heard or get a friend to ask you in a public place, once a few people find out you will be amazed at how quickly the news spreads.
 Here are some of the questions you could be asked, make sure you know how to answer them with confidence, otherwise they could get worse.

Do your parents know?
How do you know? (Often preceded by "But you can't really know")
Do you fancy me? (This is almost always from people of the same gender as you)
Do you have a girl/boyfriend? (Again whichever is the same gender as you)
What does bisexual mean?
Does that mean you are a lesbian/gay/derogatory term?
Aren't you too young to know?
How do gay/bi/lesbian people have sex?
What is it like being bi?
Why are you telling us?

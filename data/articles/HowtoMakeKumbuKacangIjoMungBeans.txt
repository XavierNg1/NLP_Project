 Then, soak the mung beans in water for two hours.
 Add the pandan leaves. Then, put in the ginger for five minutes only, after which time, fish it out.
 Cook until the mung beans pop and are soft.
, This forms the dough base for the mung bean balls.
 Set aside and leave until it cools down completely.
, For the first bowl, add the coconut pulp that you used to make the milk. In the second bowl, tip the coconut milk.
 Add an egg, and some salt, and the coconut milk. Stir the ingredients together until smooth, then tip in the vanilla extract, to give it a sweet taste. Stir again until combined. This forms the batter.
 Stir the dough and pulp together until they combine as one.


Form the mung bean balls. Take a spoonful of dough and form it into a ball, then press to form a round flat. Repeat until you have used up all of the dough and have formed as many balls as possible.
 Dip the mung bean balls, one by one, into the batter bowl. Be sure to dip enough to cover all of the ball's surface. This will help to prevent the ball from breaking apart during frying.
 Cook them until the outer part of the balls become golden and crisp.


Do this in batches. Do not try to fry too many balls at the same time.
 Remove the mung bean balls from the frying pan and the kumbu kacang ijo are ready to served.

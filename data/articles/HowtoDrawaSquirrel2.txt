This will be your squirrel’s head and body.



To do this, draw two circles. One should be bigger (the leg joint) than the other one. The circles and the head should form a slanted row of figures.



Add two curved figure for the ears. Depending on the breed, you can also modify the ears a little. Some squirrels have longer and pointier ears.
for the legs, add some trapezoids at each circle. There should be one trapezoid at the base of the hind leg circle, another connected to the arm/foreleg circle and a small trapezoid for the body.
The smallest trapezoid is for the leg hiding behind the squirrel’s body.



Draw a big flipped “S” from the body. This would be the squirrel’s tail.
At the end of each trapezoid, add small triangles for the paws.
For the face, add two small circles: one for the eyes and another for the nose.



Put in mind the overlapping lines and parts that should be hidden.
The line art might not look perfect and crisp but it should look neat when the pencil is erased.



You can add details like the ears, eyes, mouth, nose and fur.
You can also add extra lines to emphasize the paw and the fur.



Squirrel can go in different shades from orange to red or even brown or gray, all depending on the breed.

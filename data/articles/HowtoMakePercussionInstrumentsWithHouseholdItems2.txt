 Another simple percussion instrument can be made by sealing some beans into a plate. Begin by placing a small handful of the dried beans onto the center of the plate.
 While keeping the beans from falling out, fold the plate over onto itself so that it forms a half-moon shape with the beans sealed inside.
 Use a stapler to seal the two edges of the folded plate closed. You can now shake the plate in different rhythmic patterns to produce a maraca-like tone.

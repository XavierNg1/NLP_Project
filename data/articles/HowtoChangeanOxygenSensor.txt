 It will have an electrical connection attached to it.;
, Use a flat tip screwdriver to push in the tabs and pull the connection apart.
 The majority of oxygen sensors will take an SAE 7⁄8 inch (2.2 cm) wrench.
 If the new one did not come with an electrical connection, but just with the wires stubbed out, you need to do a little work.


Cut off the old connector from the bad oxygen sensor, strip the wires and solder the wires to the new oxygen sensor. You can also use butt connectors.
Use heat sensitive shrink tape to seal the connections.
Follow manufacturer's instructions to know which wires to tie together.
 Add a small amount of anti-seize to the threads of the new sensor. Screw it in place clockwise and snug it down with the socket or open-end wrench. Do not over tighten the sensor as you might strip the threads.
, Use the diagnostic scanner/reader to clear the code from the vehicle's computer.
 You should notice an immediate improvement.

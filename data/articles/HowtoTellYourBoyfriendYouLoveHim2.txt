 Though the place you chose won't affect how your boyfriend feels about you, it could help you deliver your message in a way that makes your boyfriend feel more comfortable. Telling him in the right place can also help set the mood. Here are some places to consider:


Pick a place that is special to both of you. It could be where you had your first date, your first kiss, or where you had an incredible conversation. It doesn't even have to be that romantic, as long as it means something to both of you.
Pick a romantic location. Tell him in a dimly-lit restaurant or a rose garden. The danger of picking a public spot is that it may make the situation more difficult if it doesn't go as you planned.
Tell him while you're going for a walk. Take a stroll through a beautiful part of your neighborhood. Stop him and tell him when it feels right.
Tell him when you're on vacation together. This is the perfect opportunity to take your love to the next level.
 Though timing isn't everything, picking the right time to tell your boyfriend you love him can help him be more receptive to your news, and can help you feel more comfortable about delivering it. Here are some things to consider when you're choosing the right time:


Pick a time when both of you are in a good mood and free from stress.
Don't tell him you love him if he has a big exam the next day, or he may have his mind on other things.
Tell him in the evening. Everything is more romantic in the dark.
Tell him at a time when you feel good about telling him. Remember that it has to be the right time for you, too.

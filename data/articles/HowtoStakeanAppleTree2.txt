 If you are replanting an apple tree, you'll want to make sure that your stakes are no larger than 2/3 the height of the tree itself. If you are replanting a tree, you should also measure the width of the root ball so that you know how far apart each of the stakes have to be placed into the ground without hurting the tree's roots.The stakes should be as high as the lowest hanging branches of your tree.
When replanting an adult apple tree, some of the roots may become damaged which will cause a loss of stability.
 Go to a hardware or home and gardening store and purchase metal or wooden stakes that are around 2/3 the height of your apple tree. Each stake should be at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) wide.Metal stakes provide greater overall stability when creating a permanent stake.
 Use a tape measure to mark the area where you want to plant your tree. The stakes should be placed far enough apart on each side of the tree so that when you drive them into the ground, they won't disrupt the tree's roots., Once you know where your stakes have to be, tap the top of the stakes and drive them vertically into the ground about a foot (30.48 cm) deep. You should now have two stakes running vertically on each side of your tree., Using twine, wire, nylon string, or tubing, attach the stakes to the tree near the middle of the stakes, or 1/3 the way up from the ground. Do not tie the knots too tight and make sure that there's enough slack so that your tree is free to sway slightly.

 Your first walk should be close to home. If possible, walk in a private, fenced yard.The first walks should only last for a few minutes, and then you can build up to 15-20 minute walks.Your ferret will be the leader for the most part. It is difficult to teach them to take direction like a dog.Take treats and water with you on your walk. Ferrets can easily dehydrate.
If your ferret is too scared to go outside, sit outside and allow your ferret to stay inside. Continue to hold the leash and be patient. Your ferret should be open to going outside after a few attempts.
 Once your ferret is comfortable in your yard, you can take him for a walk in your neighborhood. He may feel more comfortable walking next to hedge lines.Stay away from places where a lot of other animals are. You do not want your ferret to pick up any illnesses.Your ferret will want to explore, but do not let him drink from any ponds or puddles.
Donâ€™t let other people touch your ferret when you are out.
 Your ferret will enjoy playing in a pile of leaves, dirt, or freshly cut grass. If your ferret is staying in your yard, you can set up some of these fun things for your ferret to get into. Your ferret will not walk in a straight line as you go down the sidewalk.Try to only use the leash to keep your ferret from getting into danger such as going down drainpipes or engaging with other animals.
Pick up your ferret immediately if a dog approaches.

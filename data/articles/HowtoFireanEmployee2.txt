 Know how your team will function without this employee. Think about that job's responsibilities and be ready to assign them to someone else, or hire a more suitable employee.


If you chose to hire another employee as a replacement, be careful about your recruiting efforts. If you’re dissatisfied with your employee, it's possible they are dissatisfied with the job themselves, and are looking for similar employment elsewhere. If they come across their job description for your company, and know that you are planning to fire them, they could take offense and take retaliatory measures—anything from sabotaging clients to stealing company secrets.
 If the circumstances around the termination could be contested, offering several weeks or months pay in exchange for signing a severance agreement can be a good way to protect your organization from a damaging legal battle. It can also be a compassionate way to help an employee make it through what is sure to be a trying time.
 You want to place where both you and the employee are comfortable speaking plainly. There may be issues that did not come out beforehand about other employees, or pay information—things that are not and should not be shared indiscriminately.

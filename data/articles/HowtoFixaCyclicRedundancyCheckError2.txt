 When CHKDSK isn't able to repair the issues with your hard disk, a 3rd party disk scan utility may be able to help. Popular options like HDDScan and SeaTools will provide an alternative to CHKDSK and may help solve the issue when CHKDSK fails. Many utilities offer different software versions for different operating systems (e.g. Mac OS vs PC/Windows)
Be wary of "System cleaners' from disreputable sources. Look for established brands offering "disk utilities"., Follow the instructions to run a scan on the drive that gave you the cyclic redundancy check error. The software should list all issues it finds in a short report.
 This process can run unattended, overnight. It's important to let the repairs run to completion, and depending on the state of your hard disk this repair could take more than 2 hours.


If the repairs still aren't completed after the scan has run for more than 4 hours, this is a sign of a failing hard drive. Cancel the scan and backup whatever data you can.
 This should only take a few minutes and will ensure that there are now no errors.

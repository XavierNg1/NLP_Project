 A moka pot (Invented by the Italian company, Bialetti), also known as a stovetop espresso maker, does not really make "espresso" in the traditional sense of the word, but it does produce a small amount of very full-bodied, rich coffee.
 You will need a stovetop coffee maker with a clean filter, a grinder, and a cup., You will finish the coffee in the pot, but starting with pre-heated will prevent the coffee pot from getting too hot and scorching the coffee, which will result in a nasty taste (that's the technical term). At the same time, preheat your stove's burner on medium (if electric)., Set your grinder to medium-fine to medium using a burr grinder., Fill as full as the pot indicates, for best results., Drop the filter into the bottom section of the pot, and fill it with the ground coffee. Level it off with your finger or the handle of a spoon., Re-assemble the stovetop brewer, being careful not to spill either coffee or hot water. Use a towel to avoid burning yourself on the bottom of the pot., Make sure the handle is not directly over the heating element, be it gas or electric! Leave the lid open so you can observe the brew in progress, and remove when done., As the water comes to a boil, coffee will begin to fill the upper section. It will start out dark, then lighten up as the brewing progresses. When the coffee stream becomes pale or blonde, remove the brewer from the stove, and close the lid. Be carefulâ€”it will be hot!, Place the base in cold water, or wrap with a towel soaked in cold water. This will halt the brewing and keep the coffee sweet and rich., When the brewing has stopped, serve your coffee as desired. Pour any extra into a thermal carafe to keep it tasting good.

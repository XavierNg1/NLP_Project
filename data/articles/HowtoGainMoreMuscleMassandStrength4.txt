 Muscles need protein to get big and strong, and when you're working on building them up every week, you'll have to fuel them with a lot of protein-heavy food. Be creative with your protein sources; not all of your fuel has to come from meat.


Chicken, fish, lean beef, lean pork and other meat products are excellent sources of protein. Other animal products like chicken or duck eggs are also good choices.
Almonds, walnuts, legumes, and other vegetables also contain protein.
Soy products like tofu can also contribute to your protein intake.
 Eating food that causes your body to produce fat will help you look big, but not strong. You want to decrease the layer of fat between your muscles and skin so your hard work becomes more visible.


Avoid eating fried foods, snack foods, fast food, and other high-calorie, low-nutrition food sources.
Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other sources of healthy calories.
 Many bodybuilders help the process along by supplementing with a variety of different muscle-building products. Creatine supplements are a popular choice that has been shown to build muscles without bad side effects. The supplements are available in powdered form and should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before workouts for the maximum benefits.


Avoid supplements purporting to help you gain a certain amount of weight within a certain time period. Everyone's body is different, and products claiming to have magical muscle-building properties are probably a scam.

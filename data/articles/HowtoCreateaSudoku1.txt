 To make a Sudoku puzzle, you’ll need a pencil, a marker, a ruler and a sheet of standard printer paper. You’ll use the pencil for the first few steps so that you can erase any mistakes, while the ruler will help keep your grid even., Using your pencil and ruler, draw a large square. The square should be about 5”x5”, but you can make it larger or smaller if you like. Also, if you have a Sudoku book handy, consider tracing an existing puzzle to get a standard shape and size., Again using your pencil, divide the large outer square into 9 smaller squares. There should be three squares on the top row, three in the middle row and three in the bottom row: three equally spaced lines going across the square, and three equally spaced lines going down the square. Make sure you use a ruler to ensure that your lines are straight., Once you’ve divided the square into 9 smaller squares, you’ll need to divide those squares into even smaller grids. Using your pencil and ruler, draw three equally spaced lines across each square, then three equally spaced lines down each square. Look at an existing Sudoku puzzle if you need a reference.
 It’s easy to rub away pencil, and you don’t want your board to fade away. Trace the lines you drew with a marker or pen, making sure that the lines of the first 3x3 square are thicker and bolder. The lines of the smaller squares should be light and thin, so consider using a ballpoint pen.
 You may want to make more than one Sudoku puzzle, and you can save the hassle of having to redraw the board. Simply scan or photocopy the board and create some duplicates. Use a scanner at home or make a trip to a copy shop or library to use a photocopier.
 If you don’t want to draw your puzzle-grid by hand, find a template online. Many websites provide grids of different sizes, and you can even find one on this page. Print as many copies of your templates as you think you’ll need.

 When you are on a diet, you should eat whole foods. By eating whole foods, you are ensuring that you are getting the vitamins and minerals that your body needs. Incorporate vegetables, fruits, nuts, dairy, low-fat meats, seeds, and legumes into your daily diet to get the vitamins and minerals you need.Whole foods are overall healthier than processed or packaged foods. Though processed or packaged foods may be fortified with minerals and vitamins, they are also full of unhealthy chemicals and trans fats.
 Another way to insure that you are getting all of the vitamins and minerals that you need is to make sure that you are eating a variety of foods. This means you should eat foods from different food groups, along with different foods from the food groups.For example, donâ€™t just eat apples every day. Instead, eat a variety of fruits, like apples, bananas, oranges, strawberries, and blueberries.
 Before you take a multivitamin or a specific supplement, go see your doctor. Supplements generally are unneeded if you eat a balanced diet full of whole foods. Many mineral supplements are more difficult for your body to absorb than minerals found in food. If your doctor thinks you need a mineral supplement, they can suggest a recommended dose.Vitamin D is considered the only vitamin that needs a supplement due to the limited food sources. To get the proper amount of vitamin D, you should spend 10 to 15 minutes in the sun each day or take a supplement.

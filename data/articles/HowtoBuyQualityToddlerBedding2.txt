 The basis of a good and safe night’s sleep is a quality bed. Toddler beds are the same size as cribs and use crib-sized mattress to create a cozy area for your child. In fact, many new cribs can be converted into toddler beds, so check with your crib’s manufacturer to see if your model can be converted. Toddler beds should have side rails to stop kids from rolling out of bed. These beds come in all materials and styles, from the traditional wood frame to a fun plastic racecar bed.There isn’t one particular type of toddler bed that is better than another—as long as the bed is new and meets current safety regulations, it should work well for your child. Look for the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association (JPMA) safety seal on the bed box to know it is safe.
 Because toddler beds use crib mattresses, you should be able to keep using the mattress from your child’s crib. Make sure the mattress is firm and doesn’t have any holes or tears in the fabric.


If you need to buy a new mattress, make sure it fits snuggly into the bed frame. There are a variety of options for material and style of mattresses, so choose one that is in your price range and that is comfortable for your child.
 This will help to protect your child’s mattress, especially during potty training. If you had a mattress pad on your child’s crib, it should be sufficient for your toddler’s bed.


Mattress pads are generally much easier to wash and clean than the entire mattress underneath.
 Start your child with a smaller pillow, such as a travel or toddler-sized pillow, and then move to a standard size when they are ready and comfortable.


To reduce the risk of suffocating, pillows should be firm and have a snug-fitting pillowcase.
Flatter pillows can give children the support they need without hurting their necks.
Feather pillows can be difficult for children with allergies, so look for a pillow made of 100% cotton or 100% polyester.

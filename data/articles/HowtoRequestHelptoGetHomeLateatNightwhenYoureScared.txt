 When you know that you will be going out or working late etc, it is always a good idea to ask yourself "who am I going with?" and "what will happen in the event that I want to/have to go home earlier then the rest?";
, Tell someone who can help you get out of a tight situation where you intend to go and how long you intend to stay there. (If something happens and communication is lost at least that person knows where to start looking.)

, It helps if the above person has a contact number for someone that will be with you that night.(If something happens to your phone you can be reached on an alternative number)

, This money should only be used when you have no other option and should be kept separately from your spending money but always with you. In the event that "you have to go home late at night and you are scared," then you know you have enough money to get you home using a trusted cab company.
 Yes may seem a bit extreme, but if you have no way home and you fear that you might be alone and in danger they are your best bet. DO NOT trust strangers, even when you are desperate for help. Call the police and tell them where you are and what has happened. DO NOT make up a story that is not true to get their attention. It is not necessary. Remember they are there to "protect and serve".
 Plan your activity properly to reduce risk.
 Think logical and with a sober mind.

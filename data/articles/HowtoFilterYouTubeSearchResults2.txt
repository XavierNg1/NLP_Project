 Open the YouTube App by tapping the icon on your home screen of your phone.


The icon looks like a red circle with a white arrow in it.
 Once you have the application open, click on the magnifying glass at the top right side of the page. This will open up the search box.
 Type the video you are looking for and results will appear when you tap the enter key on your phone.
 Notice directly below the search box is two drop-down menu boxes. These boxes are how you filter your results.


The first option is “All.” If you tap on this, you can choose between channels and playlists. This could help you narrow down what videos you see.
The drop-down box next to “All” says “All time.” If you tap on this, you can see a list of time frames ranging from Live to All time; simply tap the time frame you want to search in.
Now all you have to do is look through the videos until you find the one you were searching for with filtered results!

 Hit the switch on your tub or unscrew the drain stopper to an open position so that water can go down your drain. If water is slow, or your tub fills up and doesn't drain, your drain has to be unclogged before you can clean it.;
, Bring a two-liter (8.4 cups) pot or kettle of water to a boil on your stovetop. The hot water will be able to flush any loose hair or soap scum in the drain., If you have metal pipes, you can pour the boiling water directly down the drain. You should do this at least once a week to flush built up soap scum and gunk that's left over from bathing.

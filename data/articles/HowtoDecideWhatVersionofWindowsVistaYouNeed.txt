Windows Vista Starter - This is only shipped with computers bound for poorer countries. This includes only the necessary bits to run windows vista and a computer. You can use the internet, connect to networks, run Microsoft Office and more, but it can't support the Aero GUI or more advanced software.

Windows Vista Home Basic - As above, but can be purchased in all countries. Home Basic lets you do more though. It has built in Windows Media Player 11, quick search and IE7, but doesn't boast the Aero feature. This is more for people who are using home desktops.

Windows Vista Business - As above but this version is a big improvement. This edition is recommended for laptops and has a massive feature: Aero. It also has windows MeetingSpace for sharing documents and Windows sideshow to extend your display onto 2 monitors. Windows Vista Business has some exclusive features too. you can backup entire PCs instead of just files, scan and fax and easier and more advanced remote control.

Windows Vista Home Premium - As above without fax and scan, entire backup and advanced remote control. Windows Vista home premium is even better than Business. You can create HD movies in windows movie maker, burn them to DVD, use the Aero and Flip 3D features, use a completely different operating system - Windows Media Center Edition, Schedule backups, run 3 premium games and more. Windows Vista home premium is also recommended for laptops because of its mobility center. I recommend this version as it doesn't use as much RAM as ultimate and you don't really need the extra features for a home PC.

Windows Vista Ultimate - Includes EVERYTHING above, and has some special extras like Windows Bitlocked Drive Encryption and Windows Ultimate Extras.

Windows Vista Enterprise - Windows Vista Ultimate for large businesses.;
, Are you a gamer or a business person? You may require certain things, so know what you will use your PC for.

 In order to get a concealed carry permit, an individual must be over 21, a Wisconsin resident, and not prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal or state law.The disqualifiers are basically the same disqualifiers that would bar someone from buying a handgun, along with their equivalents under Wisconsin law. There is one important addition—if you were adjudicated delinquent in another state for an offense where you would have been tried as an adult and convicted of a felony in Wisconsin, you are also disqualified., Wisconsin requires concealed carry applicants to take a course in firearms training and safety.A number of courses are acceptable, including:


The Wisconsin DNR Hunter education program or a similar course in another state.
A firearms safety course conducted by an organization that certifies firearms instructors, or an instructor certified by said agency.
A firearms safety course taught by a law enforcement agency.
A firearms safety course taught by an organization certified by the Wisconsin DOJ, or an instructor certified by the Wisconsin DOJ.
In addition, those trained in the military, law enforcement, and concealed carry holders from other states are eligible

, You’ll need to fill out the application for a concealed carry permit, make sure you sign each page, write a check or money order for $40, and make a copy of your training certification.


When all that is completed, enclose it all in an envelope and mail it to: Wisconsin Department of Justice Attn: Firearms Unit, PO Box 7130 Madison, WI, 53707-7130

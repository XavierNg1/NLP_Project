 Was it something you saw on TV? Did your friend recommend it to you? Give yourself some time before you start that activity to think about what you think makes it the right thing for you.;
, Go on the Internet and do some study on that activity and/or talk to people who participate in the activity. This makes you feel more excited about your chosen activity and you will know some of the basics when you start.
 If you are planning to do an activity, you should also be considering a place to do it. If you are taking up the violin, is there a string group at your school? Is there a local club for those taking up a sport? Are there any Dance Academies or schools around your area for the dancers? Again, do some research. Browse around some different clubs that suit what you are going to be learning and where you live.
 Think about your new activity and what it'll be like, dream about it, just go plain crazy - make sure you feel excited or happy to be doing your new hobby. Don't do a hobby you don't like. You have to think positive to exceed, anyhow.
 If you are going to be starting a hobby, make sure you have what you need. If you are starting soccer, make sure you have good soccer boots and the long soccer socks. Starting flute? Make sure you have a flute before you begin! Have everything ready.
 When you wake up, you will feel automatically happier. By the way, you need sleep to do something energetic.
 They know what"s best for you and will make sure you don't bail out., Have fun. Remember - try your best and drink lots of water! Don't forget to eat either!

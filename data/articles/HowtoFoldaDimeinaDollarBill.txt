 Fold the bill in half across the length. Then unfold; this will leave you with a crease. The pictures to the right show then end result of each step.;
,, Then unfold; make sure the creases are very pronounced.
 When folding the bill, make sure you fold it backwards not forwards. Also make sure the folded edge is on the right side when placed in front of you.
 Then unfold to make creases.
 When finished with this step your bill will come to a point.
 Fold it toward the side with the point. Make sure you are left with a little triangle at the point.
 You should already have crease made from step 3.
 Fold the top and bottom edges towards the center. The folds should be easy considering you already made the crease previously.
 Hold the bottom layer in your left hand and hold the top layer in your right. Pull the top layer to the right. Once you open it up put your finger in the box part to open it up a bit.
 Your dime should fit in the box very snug. If you were to hold it upside down the dime should not fall out.
 Make sure you slide it in under the folds. You can adjust the size of the ring by forcing more of the long end into the shorter end. If it happens to not stay together for you, you might have to tape it to get it secure.

 Anything that you do not want to be the same color of the car when you are done should be removed to avoid accidentally spraying them with paint.;
, You can do this by using paint remover or by simply sanding all of it off the vehicle. If the paint is good, then you only need to sand it with 360 grit sandpaper. You should be down to bare metal when you are done.
 No exposed surface that you plan to paint should be left un-primed. Let the surface dry completely before you begin painting.
 You can use a painting prep solvent to remove any grease, wax or oils on it.
 Hold the sprayer 6" â€“ 10" from the surface and spray in smooth and level strokes, overlapping strokes by about 50 percent. Check the paint manufacturer's instructions about drying times before sanding.
 This may not be a good idea for a metallic color because it could remove metallic flakes from the base coat.
 Let it dry completely before sanding. More than one coat may be needed to get full coverage on some metallic paints

, Polish your clear coat and make your paint job shine.

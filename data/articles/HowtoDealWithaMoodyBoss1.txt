 Start noticing patterns in your boss’s moody behavior. For instance, your boss might typically be in a foul mood in the mornings before having some coffee or after having a meeting with their own supervisor. If you know that your boss will be in a mood during those times, keep your head down, do your work, and avoid asking them questions until later.Select meeting times when your boss’s mood seems to be better or during low stress periods at work.
You might also consider making a note of every time your boss is in a bad mood. Write down the time and the circumstances surrounding their mood.;
, When your boss is in a foul mood, avoid knocking on their door or calling them to ask them questions. Instead, work to problem solve on your own and avoid making any major decisions until you can clear it when your boss is in a better mood.
 When you feel that your boss is on edge and on the verge of an outburst, do what you can to deescalate the situation. If they have recently helped you with something or given good advice, send them an email saying “Thank you for all of your help with my project yesterday.” This will help to stroke their ego a bit, soothe them, and avoid them seeing you from a lens of anger.You might also do a random act of kindness for them like bringing them some coffee.
 Though you might feel that your boss is moody, you should first determine what you are doing, if anything, to contribute to that. If you do not complete your tasks on time, regularly come in late, or often make mistakes, then you could be the problem. Work to improve yourself so that you do not trigger frustration in your boss or peers.Listen carefully when your boss gives you a task or a piece of constructive criticism and work to follow through. Don’t use your cell phone during this time.
However, regardless of what you have done, your boss should not yell, curse, or insult you.

 Tell them how much you love their products and say that you are a big fan of the company.


Add a personal experience story. For example, if you want free products from a pet supply company, write a story about how you've used the company's products in the past to care for your pets. Be as specific and enthusiastic as possible.
Request the free products. Ask if the company has any free samples or coupons that they could send you for being a loyal customer., Register and list your birthdate on the company website and wait for your free offer.
 Then, contact your favorite companies and ask if they will send free samples for you to review. Companies will often send you free samples of their products in exchange for the free publicity provided by your blog.

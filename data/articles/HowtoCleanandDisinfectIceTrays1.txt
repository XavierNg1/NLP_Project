 Turn on the warm water tap and hold the ice trays under the stream. This will remove loose debris from the trays and melt any ice or frost residue., Measure out two teaspoons of baking soda and Â½ cup (60 mL) warm water. Dump them in a medium-sized bowl. Use a spoon the mix them together., Fill up each little cube section in your trays with the baking soda solution. Allow the trays to soak in the solution for a few minutes. Set any remaining solution aside; you may need to use more of it., With the trays still filled with the solution, use a washcloth to scrub each cube section. Be sure to get down into the nooks and crannies. Use the washcloth to go over the plastic between and around the cube sections, as well., Turn on your warm water tap and hold the trays underneath it to rinse away the baking soda solution. Keep rinsing until you no longer see any baking soda residue and the water runs clear., You can put them on a dish rack to dry, or simply use a clean cloth the dry them. Once the trays are dry, refill them with water and place them in your freezer as you normally would to make ice., Ice trays (and the ice inside them) absorb odors from other items in your freezer over time. This often results in bad-tasting ice cubes. An open box of baking soda will soak up odors in your freezer and drastically reduce what your ice trays absorb.Replace the backing soda with a new box every 30 days for best results.
Make sure all of the food in your freezer is packaged tightly to reduce odors.

 An ear reflexology massage will be more effective if you are relaxed during the process. Try laying in a comfortable position with your head supported by a pillow or two. You might also enjoy listening to some soothing music or burning a pleasant smelling candle during your ear reflexology massage.
 Hold the ridge of your ear between your index finger and thumb, with your index finger on top of the ear. Slowly work your way from the top of your ear down along the ridge and back up for two to three minutes.This will cover the regions corresponding to the shoulders, elbows, wrists, feet and ankles.
 Using your index finger, massage along this area using circular motions. Massage the area for two to three minutes, moving down along the depression as you go.This will cover the regions of the ear corresponding to the neck, hips, knees, and back/spinal region and parts of the pelvis.


Repeat this process three times.
 Next, use the tip of your index finger to press gently around the area of the ear canal. Do NOT put your finger into the ear canal. Press this area gently, slowly moving your index finger around the ear canal as you press. Then, move to the junction between the earlobe and jawline and gently press on the area. Do this for two to three minutes.This will cover the regions of the ear corresponding to the internal organs.
 Gently press and roll your earlobes between your thumb and first two fingers for two to three minutes. You can also pull gently on the lobes.This motion may help to alleviate pain or tension in your head and neck regions.
 The last thing that you should do it hook your thumb under the central fold of your ear (the antihelix) and gently pull your ears upwards three times. This final ear tug will help to improve circulation and will also complete the ear reflexology massage.

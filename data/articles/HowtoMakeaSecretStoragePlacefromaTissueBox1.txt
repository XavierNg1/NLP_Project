 If you are trying to store big items, they will not fit in a small box.;
, When you try to insert items into the tissue box, they will not fit, that is why it is important to remove that layer.
 Using scissors, start  in the middle and cut to the edge of the box. From there, cut around the box to remove the top layer of cardboard off the box.
 To give it color, cover it if you do not like the design on the box.
 You are ready to store things––just add the items and you are done!

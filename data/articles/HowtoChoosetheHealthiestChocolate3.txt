Any foods that are eaten too much or too frequently can cause weight gain due to extra calories your body doesn't need. This is especially true for chocolate that contains sugar.It's typically recommended to eat about 1 oz of chocolate per serving per day.

They're automatically portion controlled and can keep your consumption in check.

 Talking about your strengths and positive accomplishments may be harder than you think. To prepare for questions regarding this, you should write down a list of your greatest strengths and achievements., Write down the most relevant work experiences you've had, and strengths that have followed you from job to job. Adding a recent concrete example of a recent work experience will give credence to your pitch., Once you've written down all the elements to your pitch, you can put it together into a cohesive statement. Start with an introductory statement about your experience, and then talk about your positive personality traits. Try to frame your experience in a realistic and concrete way.


An example of a good pitch would be something like "I'm a 30 year veteran in writing and editing. My last job was as a senior editor at Shark Publishing Co. While I was there, I wrote over 30 different published manuscripts and manuals. One of the best things about me is that I'm a hard worker and always meet deadlines. As an example, last year we had a deadline that we didn't get the details for until two days beforehand. I worked 12 hours straight to make sure that the content got in on time."

, You can use your pitch to answer questions like "Tell me about yourself," "What experience do you have that would help you in this role?" and "What are your greatest accomplishments?"

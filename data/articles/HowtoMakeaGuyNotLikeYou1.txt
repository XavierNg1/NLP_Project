 If a guy tells you he likes you, tell him the straight, honest truth: you don’t like him back. You can say it in a nice way like, “That’s really sweet, but I just don’t have feelings for you like that,” or “I think you’re really cool and funny, but I don’t like you in the same way." Most guys will take the hint and stop pursuing you.Make sure to talk to him right away. Waiting to act will only confuse him or allow him to keep thinking that he has a chance with you.;
, Know that his feelings might be hurt, but it’s your right to draw a boundary for what you want and are comfortable with.


Stick with your rejection. Use clear language like “No, thank you” and “No, I’m not interested” rather than “No, maybe some other time” or “No, not really.” Don’t leave room for the possibility that you’d be interested later, or he might get the idea that he has time to change your mind., Tell him any good practical reasons why it wouldn’t make sense for him to date you. He might respond better to reason.


If you already have a boyfriend or someone you’re interested, that’s an easy reason to give him!
If you live on the opposite side of town and wouldn’t be able to easily see him outside of school or work, tell him: “We live so far away, we wouldn’t get to see each other.”
If you’re going to a different middle school, high school, or college than him next year, point out to him that this wouldn’t work well.
 It’s okay to tell a little white lie to make your point if he won’t leave you alone: “I’m interested in someone else,” “I’m already dating someone,” or “I’m not interested in guys” are all reasonable excuses to get him off your tail, whether true or not.
 Ask a friend or think of someone else who’s interested in him, and then explain to him why that person might be a better match. Make sure you have permission from whoever you’re setting him up with.

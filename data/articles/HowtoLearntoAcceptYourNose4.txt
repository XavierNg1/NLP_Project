 Your nose does not make or break your success in life, but it can still be helpful to find examples of successful people with unique noses. These can be your role models as you build your confidence. Some famous people with large or unique noses include: Barbra Streisand, Bette Midler, Andy Samberg, Sofia Coppola, Oprah Winfrey, and many others.
 Talk with your best friend about how you feel about your nose. Oftentimes, when you express an anxiety out loud to someone else, you find out that youâ€™re the only one who has noticed it.
 Chances are, someone in your family has a nose that looks like yours. Talk with this person about your concerns. Ask if he has experienced a drop in self-confidence because of his nose. Ask how he has dealt with it.
 Check your local area for a support group that brings together people who feel uncomfortable about their physical appearance.
 If you still have trouble accepting your appearance, you may find it useful to talk with a mental health therapist. This person can help you work through your emotions about your nose. He can also help you come up with strategies for coming to terms with your nose.

 It is this person's job to keep an eye on how well the pairs are keeping together. Find a comfortable floor space; carpeted or grassed is best.;
, Have them stand back to back. Each pair must connect by linking each other's pinky fingers.
 They must actually sit on the ground, linked the whole time, backsides touching the whole time.
 The same rules apply; they must stay linked by their pinkies the whole time, keeping their backsides together.
 Any pair who loses contact with either pinky fingers or backsides is automatically disqualified. The winners are the pairs who can do this without breaking. It's a lot harder than it sounds!

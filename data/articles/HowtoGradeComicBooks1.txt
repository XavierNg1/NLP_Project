 When grading a comic book, the first thing you'll see is the cover. Take a close look, ideally with a magnifying glass, and make careful notes of any apparent damage, including:Bends, folds, or dents that warp the shape or surface of the book, but don't affect the color
Coackling, a bubbling effect on the cover usually caused by printing defects
Creases, more severe folds that remove ink or otherwise create distortions in the coloring
Tears
Moisture, water damage, or "foxing" (bacterial or fungal growth on the paper)
Fading, lack of gloss, or "dust shadow" (partial exposure to dust or air resulting in uneven fading)
Fingerprints, especially those which in which skin oils have led to discoloration of the ink
Chew (rodent damage)
Writing or other soiling of the cover.;
, Look for evidence of tape or glue or other attempts to repair the book. These generally have a negative effect on the value.Note that more sophisticated efforts to restore a comic book, such as color restoration or re-glossing are often undetectable by amateur graders (and sometimes even professionals), but can also have a negative effect on value if noticed by a potential buyer. Such restorations should be noted upfront before attempting to sell a comic book., Less obvious but equally important to the surface of the cover is the spine of the comic book. Inspect it closely, making note of any of the following:Spine stress/bindery tears, small creases, folds, or tears (under 1/4 inch) running perpendicular to the spine
Spine roll, a curvature of the left edge of a comic toward the front or back, caused by folding back each page of the comic as it was read
Spine break, spine stress that has become a full tear (usually through multiple pages), typically found near the staples
Spine split, a clean, even separation at the fold, usually (but not always) right above or below a staple

, The staples themselves must also be inspected closely. Make sure no staples are missing at that the staples are in good condition.Look for signs of rust on the staples, as well as "popped" staples. A popped staple occurs when one side of a cover has torn right next to the staple, but remains attached by the paper beneath the staple. This condition can easily lead to detached staples.

 If you are not interested in her, you should respond by not engaging in the flirtatious behaviour. You should continue to be kind towards her, but keep your interactions strictly on a friendship level., You can show that you are not interested by using closed body language, such as crossing your arms, turning your body away from her, and avoiding frequent or extended eye contact., If she continues to flirt with you, despite your attempts to convey disinterest, then you should have a conversation with her about it. Tell her that you aren’t interested in a romantic relationship with her. You should be direct and to the point, so that there is no misinterpretation.Let her know you would still like to be friends with her, if this is the case.
If you are already in a relationship with someone else, you should let her know, as this will help her better understand where you are coming from. Knowing that you are not available should stop her flirting.
Alternatively, if you aren’t in a relationship you could say that you are in order to help convey your disinterest. This only works if she doesn’t know you or your friends very well, and will not find out that you aren’t being truthful.
You can also communicate your disinterest through text if she has been flirting with you by text.
 If the flirting continues after you have expressed your stance and discomfort with the situation, you should stop spending time with her. Take yourself out of the situation by avoiding all interaction with her, when possible.


This can include not responding to her flirty texts and deleting or blocking her number if she persists after you have asked her to stop.

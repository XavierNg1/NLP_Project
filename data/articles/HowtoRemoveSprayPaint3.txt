 Purchase a solvent gel marked “paint and varnish stripper” to remove spray paint from masonry or stone walls. Put on a pair of protective gloves and use a paintbrush to apply a thick layer of the gel onto the spray painted surface.Be sure to test the stripper in an inconspicuous area before applying it to the entire affected surface., If you’re treating items like a decorative object or piece of furniture, wrap it completely in plastic. If you’re removing spray paint from a wall, cover the area with plastic. Make sure the plastic wrap tightly covers all areas where you’ve applied the gel., You can remove the gel once you see the surface start to warp and wrinkle, or after about four hours. Pressure wash with cold water at a setting less than 300 psi. Hold the nozzle about 1.5 to 2.5 feet (about 0.5 to 0.75 meter) from the surface, and wash from the bottom up to prevent dripping pigment from re-staining the surface.Wear work clothes, protective gloves, and goggles when pressure washing a wall.
Repeat the stripping process on stubborn patches as necessary if any paint remains.
 Even after pressure washing, stripper can leave a residual shadow on stone or brick walls and other porous surfaces. Purchase masonry cleaner and dilute it at one part cleaner to six parts water. Apply the diluted solution to the surface, let it sit for one to two minutes, then pressure wash with cold water.

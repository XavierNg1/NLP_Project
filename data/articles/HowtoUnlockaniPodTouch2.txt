 You can find this at http://www.apple.com/itunes/.
 Once opened, connect your iPod to your computer with the proper cable.
 In the top right of the iTunes window, an icon for your iPod should appear. Click on that to open the control panel for your iPod.
 iTunes will display the possible options for what to do next:


Option 1: Restore. This will restore the same iPod software you already have loaded.
Option 2: Use Same Version. This will restore the iPod using the same software you're using even if there's a newer version available.
Option 3: Use Newest Version. This will restore your iPod with the latest iPod software on your computer. Used if the latest version is the same version on your iPod.
Option 4: Restore and Update. This will restore your iPod and update the current software with the latest version loaded on your computer.
If you're on a Macintosh, you'll be prompted to enter the administrator's name and password.
 iTunes will perform a restore that will take several minutes to complete. It is very important that you do not disconnect the iPod from the computer during this process.
 Name your iPod, choose your syncing preferences, and reload any music, videos, and other things stored in your iTunes library.

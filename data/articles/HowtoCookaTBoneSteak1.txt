 A firm, bright red, steak will be fresher than a soft, darker colored, one. Also look for an even distribution of thin white lines of fat, known as marbling, throughout the surface. The marbling melts and moistens the meat during cooking, making your steak tender and flavorful.Choose an evenly cut steak that is about 1 1/4 inches (31.75 mm) thick.
Check the packing and expiration dates to confirm freshness.
If you're buying your steak in the United States, look out for the USDA beef grade on the label, which is an official indicator of quality: "Prime" is the best, followed by "Choice," and then "Select.";
, Take your steak out of the fridge or freezer before cooking to let it thaw to room temperature, about 70ºF (21ºC). Avoid cooking your steak cold because the meat will contract and be tough to chew., Pat it down with a paper towel. The meat should be dry so that you do not end up steaming it instead!








, Gentle seasoning, such as a sprinkling of salt, will help enhance the natural flavors of your steak. If you're feeling adventurous, you could also try pepper, paprika, or other dry spices.









Avoid over-seasoning because it will prevent you from tasting your steak's natural goodness.
If you use salt, don't season your steaks right before cooking, as this will add moisture which will interfere with the cooking process.
If you would like to use wet seasonings, it is best to marinate and refrigerate your steak for a couple of hours. Remember to also allow time for it to be removed from the fridge and reach room temperature before cooking.

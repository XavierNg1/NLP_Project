, Use a spoon to pour and spread half a cup of marinara sauce around the bottom of the dish. On top, place 1 piece of matzoh and break another piece so that the pan is filled.
 Cover with a moderate amount of ricotta cheese, followed by a larger amount of mozzarella and a smattering of Parmesan cheese.
 This should be done until there are about 3 to 4 layers, or the pan is filled to the top. Add more marinara sauce to the final piece of matzoh, then add the slices of mozzarella and one more sprinkle of Parmesan. Top with salt, pepper, herbs, spices, etc. as desired or basil leaves for garnishment.
 The ideal cook time is 25 to 35 minutes, until the cheese is lightly browned.
 Before slicing, allow several minutes for it to cool.

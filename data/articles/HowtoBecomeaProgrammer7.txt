 Programming scientists are very advanced programmers who, instead of working on developing applications, work on developing computing technologies such as encryption, programming languages and data mining algorithms. This level is seldom achieved without academic study and dedication.
 This can be done either by:


Taking an actual academic degree (which is what usually happens).
Getting the courses' outlines for such a degree from one of the modern universities and taking the courses either by self-study or as separate courses. This could be achieved theoretically, but the recommended path is the first.
 The more specific, the better. This depends on your preferences. However, here is a list of some of the major topics in computer programming science:


Algorithm design (searching, sorting, encryption, decryption and error detection in communications are some examples)
Programming languages/compiler design/optimization
Artificial intelligence fields (pattern recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, neural networks)
Robotics
Scientific programming
Super computing
Computer aided design/modeling (CAD/CAM)
Virtual reality
Computer graphics (Computer graphics is usually wrongly confused with graphical design or graphical user interface design. Computer graphics is the field of studying how to represent and manipulate graphics in computer systems.)

, You might wish to pursue a master's degree or a doctorate.

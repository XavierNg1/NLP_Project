 This also has the added bonus of keeping your food fresher. Also, should bugs that come in egg form in the foodstuffs hatch, they're caught inside the container, making their disposal easy and preventing their spread through the entire pantry. It's definitely worth the initial outlay on good storage containers.
 Tables and countertops should be regularly sprayed and cleaned with a mild bleach or vinegar solution.
 Sweep, mop, and vacuum regularly.
 Avoid leaving dirty dishes and standing water for ants to drink and do not put food in the drain. Remove all in-sink disposal scraps as soon as added.
 Add some water to the larger bowl, creating a moat around the pet food that the ants can't easily cross. Refill regularly.

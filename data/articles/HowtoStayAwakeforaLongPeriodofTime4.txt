 Caffeine is a legal drug found in coffee, chocolate, energy drinks, and in pill form. It is a stimulant and can make it difficult to fall asleep.Caffeine has other effects including increased blood pressure, increasing heart rate, dizziness, dehydration, and headaches.According to experts, up to 400 milligrams per day of caffeine is safe for most people.Children and teenagers should not consume more than 100 milligrams of caffeine per day.Over-the-counter caffeine pills for adults should not be more than 100–200 mg every three to four hours as needed.
Avoid over-consuming caffeine. In large doses it can be dangerous.
 Too much alcohol has a depressant effect on the nervous system (the opposite of the stimulant effect that caffeine has).Moreover, even a little alcohol will likely help you to relax, and this is exactly what you do not want when trying to stay awake for many hours.
 Although some illegal drugs are stimulants (methamphetamine, cocaine), you should avoid using these as a method to stay awake. These drugs can be harmful and potentially deadly.


Unintended adverse side effects of cocaine include anxiety, irritability, panic attacks, suspiciousness, paranoia, psychotic symptoms, delusions, and hallucinations.
Side effects of methamphetamine include similar symptoms of hypertension, rapid heart rate, severe agitation, and psychosis.

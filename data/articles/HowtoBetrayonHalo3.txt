 This may require shooting him a little. follow him around and teabag him every time he dies, last but not least call him an annoying nick name the whole game (such as "kid").;
, But keep in mind you don't want to kill him just yet. First you let some one on the other team to shoot him just one then rocket that hoe and teabag him. Repeat this process 2-3 times and if he hasn't quit yet, move on to step 3.
 Get a power weapon, put him in your sights, and pull the trigger. Right after you kill him teabag him repeatedly. Repeat this step until you get booted. Now for the fun part: Go into Theater and take a video of you betraying him and teabagging him. Send it to him. This will almost always spark a 1v1. Reply to his message with "i don't 1v1 noobs".

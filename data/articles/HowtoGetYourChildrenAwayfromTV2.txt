 When the whole family is having fun outside the home, kids won’t miss the TV. Plan exciting outdoor adventures in your local community, such as a treasure hunt in the park or a tour of a nearby museum.
 Make art supplies available to your children in a special place in your home. Let them have free reign of these materials to make crafts, paint, color, or write imaginative stories. On occasion, sit down together and do creative activities that involve the whole family. That way, kids will see these activities as fun rather than a sad replacement for television., You know how important regular exercise is for health and wellness. Counteract the couch potato syndrome by getting your kids up and moving. Take a Frisbee out into the yard. Lace up your trainers and walk to a nearby park. It may also be fun to run a kids’ “exercise boot camp” on the weekend.


Getting your children involved in sports at school or in the community is also a great way for them to stay active. Being active also lessens the amount of time they have to spend watching TV., Reading can be just as fun and vivid as watching a TV show or movie. Introduce your children to stories that help them escape from everyday stress into imaginary worlds. Load everyone into the car for a weekly visit to your local library.Make reading all the more interesting by telling your kids about the books you enjoyed as a kid. Try to find them in your library or online.
 Time spent with their parents and siblings is rich and enjoyable. Your kids will soon learn this as they spend more time away from TV. Another way to promote non-screen time is by scheduling a family game night. Take a vote on which board game to play and have at it.Make sure you select games that are appropriate for all of your children.

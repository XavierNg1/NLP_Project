 Using plain printer paper is best -- if you pick paper that is thicker, it will fall too easily, and if you pick thinner paper, it won't be able to gather enough momentum to really fly. After you fold the paper, run your finger along the crease to secure it.;
, Just unfold the piece of paper the same way you folded it. Make sure the crease is prominent and runs all the way down the paper.
 You should create two similar right triangles with edges that meet right along the line of the crease. They should be as close to the same size as possible.
 The tip of the top corner should move down to touch the bottom of the edges where the two triangles meet.
 Fold the paper in half lengthwise just as you did in the beginning. Fold it along the same crease. You can reinforce the crease again, if you like.
 Once the paper is folded in half, grab one side by the outer edge of the diagonal part and fold it over toward the middle crease, so that you see a small triangle with a bottom edge that touches the middle crease. Turn the paper over and do the same on the other side. You will create a long, rectangular shape with triangles on either side of the plane. Try to make the handle .4 inches (1 cm) long at most.
 Grab the airplane by the handle in the middle and gently throw it upward. You'll see that this plane creates loops instead of flying straight ahead. Keep playing with it -- experiment to see how throwing the plane faster or slower affects the movements of the plane.

 This puts it in temporary sleep mode, building the battery back up in the process. To awaken it, open it.;
,, Go to the settings/brightness screen. Turn the brightness of the backlights all the way down. It may be a bit difficult to see, but it reserves the battery for at least 2-3 more hours. On a DSi, hold the select button and hold the down volume button. This won't change the volume, but rather the screen's brightness.
 On a DSi, go to "System Settings", then tap "Wireless Communications", then tap turn off "Wireless Communications."

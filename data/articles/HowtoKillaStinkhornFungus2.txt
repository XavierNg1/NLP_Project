 Begin this process in your kitchen by boiling the water in a large saucepan on your stovetop. Then, in your yard or garage, pour in bleach.Add roughly the same amount of bleach as you did of water (e.g. 4 cups of each) so that they’re mixed at a 1:1 ratio.


When working with bleach, make sure to wear clothes that you don’t mind ruining, since the bleach will remove color from any fabric it splashes onto. Also consider wearing eye protection (such as safety goggles) to avoid the risk of splashing bleach into your eyes.
Be aware that removing mushrooms using bleach or lime will likely harm—and possibly kill—other plants in the area. The chemicals will also damage your soil.
 Do this while the water is still hot; do not wait for the solution to cool down.The combination of boiling hot water and potent bleach should be enough to kill any lingering stinkhorns, and prevent new mushrooms from growing in the soil.


If you choose to first dig up the mushrooms before you apply bleach, simply pour the hot bleach solution over the entire area from which you dug up the stinkhorns.
 If you haven’t had success removing stinkhorn mushrooms, lime will help by making the soil uninhabitable for the fungus. Using a shovel or trowel, spread the lime over the patch of soil that has been producing stinkhorn fungi.Lime is a caustic substance, so be careful when handling it.


You should be able to purchase lime at a local hardware store, plant nursery, or gardening center.
Before applying the lime to the soil, read the instructions printed on the package. You may need to first dampen the soil before laying down lime.

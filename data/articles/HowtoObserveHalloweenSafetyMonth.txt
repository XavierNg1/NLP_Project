, Kids should never go out trick or treating without an adult. Have an adult walk the kid to the door or wait in the driveway. Travel around other groups and walk to doors at the same time as other people. Insist teenagers to go with friends if they refuse to go out with family.
 Don't let kids eat their candy until they get home and you have inspected their gatherings. Ask them what they got and observe what kinds and brands of candy and items they have received.
 Cross the street with caution and when there's no cars present. Avoid jaywalking and find the nearest cross-path; this is the legal way to cross a major street and to avoid a vehicle accident.
 Use the house as the meeting grounds and not the park or shopping center. Have the adults set the guidelines and curfews.

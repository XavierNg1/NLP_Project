 Look for the Facebook app on your mobile device and tap on it.
 If you logged out of your previous Facebook session, you will be asked to log in again. Enter your login details in its respective fields and tap “Log in” to access your account.
 Tap on your name on the header toolbar. You will be brought to your Timeline, or wall. Tap on the Photos box, right below your cover photo, and you will be brought to your Photos screen.


The photos on the mobile app are organized by albums.
 Scroll through your photo albums and tap on the one you want to delete. The album will open and the photos inside it will be displayed.
 Tap on the icon with three dots on the upper right corner. Click on the “Delete” button, and the album and all the photos inside it will be removed from Facebook.

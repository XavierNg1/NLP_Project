 Three basic types are available: silica (as found in products like Delta Dust or Safer Ant & Crawling Insect Killer), diatomaceous earth (Roach and Ant Killer D-E Dust), and boric acid (Borid, Pic Boric, or Roach Prufe). Silica and diatomaceous earth work by damaging and desiccating the cockroachâ€™s exoskeleton, while boric acid is highly toxic to roaches when ingested.Borax (sodium borate) is often used as a homemade roach pesticide. Borax contains the same element (boron) as boric acid, but may be less effective as a pesticide.
 These dusts should be used sparingly. Roaches will notice and avoid big piles of dust. Use a small pesticide powder duster to puff a thin (barely visible) film into cracks, void spaces around cabinets, and underneath appliances. Re-apply your dusts every 3-4 months, or as recommended by the manufacturer.
 Although these pesticides are relatively safe, they can still be harmful. Be especially cautious when using dusts that contain boric acid. Do not use these dusts on surfaces where food is prepared or consumed.

 This is the gear icon on the menu panel on the left part of the window. This will open the "Options" menu.
 In Settings, locate the “Secure Deletion” in the screen. The setting offers two options:


Normal File Deletion—This option offers no security at all and will delete any file it detects to be junk.
Secure File Deletion—Sets the number of times the system will read a file to determine whether or not it needs to be deleted.
 There are four degrees of Secure File Deletion:


Simple Overwrite (1 Pass)
Advance Overwrite (3 Passes)
Complex Overwrite (7 Passes)
Very Complex Overwrite (35 Passes)

, You can also set whether to include “Wipe Alternate Data Streams” and “Wipe Cluster Tips.” It is unchecked by default since it involves complex file deletions.

 For travel in the US, a passenger is allowed in their carry-on no more 3 bottles containing no more than 3.4 ounces (100 ml) of liquid. Bottles must be placed in a quart-sized, clear plastic, zip-top bag.
 Certain items that are generally permitted may still be subject to additional screening or prohibited at security's discretion (such as if it triggers an alarm or appears to have been tampered with). Items that can potentially pose security concerns include:


sharp objects
sporting goods
tools
firearms and martial arts weapons
foods including creamy dips, jams, and salsa
liquid contain decorative items such as lava lamps or snow globes

, This will not only enable you to carry the item on the aircraft with you, it will also assist with any questions a customs officer might raise in your country of arrival.
 If you are unsure about an item, mail it ahead of time or leave it at home.

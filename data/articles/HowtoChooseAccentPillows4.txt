 If you are more into a symmetrical look for the space, try arranging the accent pillows in symmetrical layers. This means having the same number of pillows on either side of your couch or bed. Layer them on top of each other so there are contrasting shapes, textures, and colors in the space.For example, you may layer one round, print accent pillow with one solid square accent pillow on either side of your sofa. Or you may layer two round solid accent pillows under a smaller square pillow on either side of your bed.
 To create a good visual, arrange the pillows so they get smaller as they move towards the inside of your sofa or your bed. Keep the largest pillows on the far corners and the smaller pillows on the inside. This will ensure the space is comfortable to rest on and create a balanced visual.


For example, place a large square pillow first, followed by a smaller round pillow, and then a small bolster.
 There is such a thing as too many accent pillows on your sofa or bed. Do not be afraid to remove any accent pillows from the space if it starts to feel overstuffed or overcrowded. Try testing out the accent pillows by sitting or lying down on the sofa or bed. If it feels like there are too many pillows and you cannot sit on the sofa or bed comfortably, you may need to remove some pillows.You should also consider the rest of the space. If the room has a lot of decoration and other furnishing, you may cut down on the number of accent pillows you use. If the room is more sparsely decorated, you may increase the number of accent pillows.

 Thanks to a coating of sand covered with glue, this cardboard pyramid looks like a realistic flat-sided pyramid, but it's lightweight and doesn't take very long to put together. You probably have most of the supplies on hand already. Gather the following materials to make your cardboard pyramid:


A large flattened cardboard box or piece of cardboard
A ruler
A pencil
Scissors
Hot glue gun and sticks
White school glue
Paint brush
Sand;
, Use your ruler and pencil to draw an 8-inch (20.3 cm) square on your cardboard. Now draw four equilateral triangles with 8-inch (20.3 cm) bases. Use the scissors to cut out the shapes, so you have a square base and four triangular sides.


If you want to make a a larger pyramid, you can make a 9 or 10-inch (22.9 or 25.4 cm) square and triangles with matching bases. Just make sure the bases of the triangles is the same as a side of the square.
You can use a craft knife instead of a scissors if the cardboard is stiff and difficult to cut.
 Heat up your glue gun and put a line of glue along the bottom of a triangle. Line it up with one edge of the square and press it lightly. Do the same with the other three triangles, gluing their bases to the square.
 Lean the triangles in so that their points meet and create a pyramid shape. Seal the edges together with a line of hot glue.
, Pour some into a dish and use the paintbrush to paint the entire cardboard pyramid with an even coating of glue. Don't forget to cover the edges, too, so you'll be able to hide the cracks with sand.
 Before the glue dries, cover the pyramid with sand.Try to sprinkle on an even amount so that the entire pyramid is evenly coated in a layer of sand.

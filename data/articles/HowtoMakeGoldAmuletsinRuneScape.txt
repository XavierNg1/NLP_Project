 To craft a golden amulet on a furnace, you must first have a crafting level of 8. Methods of levelling your crafting level from level 1 include crafting cracked mining urns, cracked fishing urns and gold rings.
 After training your crafting skill to level 8, it is now time to collect the resources needed to craft your first very own gold amulet. You will need 1 golden bar and an amulet mould, and also access to a nearby furnace., Use the gold bar on the furnace with the amulet mould in your inventory, and in return you will be given a gold amulet and 30 crafting experience. Congratulations, you have just made your first gold amulet!, Finally, to wear the gold amulet you must string it using either the magic spell String Jewellery (requires level 80 magic) or a ball of wool. For both methods, right click either the spell or the ball of wool and use on the unstrung gold amulet to string it. The amulet in your inventory should now be wearable.

 To learn about the rules and schedule for recycling in your community, visit your municipal government's website or call its office for information. While some communities have weekly curbside pickup for recycling, others might only have a recycling center for citizens to bring their refuse to. Be sure to note the guidelines listed for recycling, such as what receptacles are alright to use., If there is any liquid remaining in the milk container, pour it all out before recycling. To avoid odors while you store your recyclables, rinse out the milk container once you are done with it. Any liquid left inside could result in a contamination of the recycling process., Find out if your municipality offers single-stream recycling, which means that items are separated by a machine at the sorting center. If this is the case, your recyclable items can all be deposited into the same recycling bin. If this is not the case, make sure to separate your recycling into separate bins for paper, metal, and plastic., Avoid recycling milk containers in plastic bags, which can cause machinery trouble at recycling plants. Thin plastics must be recycled separately from bigger items as they may damage the sorting systems in many recycling facilities, halting an entire load in the process. Store milk containers in a municipally-approved recycling bin and dispose of them as mandated by your community.

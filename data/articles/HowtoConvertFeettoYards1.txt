 It is fairly well known that one yard is equal to three feet. To convert measurements into yards that wee originally taken in feet, you need to write this conversion factor as a conversion ratio. The ratio is 1 yard3 feet{\displaystyle {\frac {1{\text{ yard}}}{3{\text{ feet}}}}}. Because the numerator and denominator values are equal, this conversion fraction is equal to 1.Whenever a fraction has a value of 1, you can use it to multiply any number without changing its value but you will convert the units.

, When you begin with a measurement in feet that you want to convert to yards instead, you can set up a simple equation using the conversion ratio. As long as the conversion ratio is correct and is equal to 1, the value of the measurement will be unchanged.For example, suppose you have a measurement of 12 feet that you want to convert into yards. Write a brief multiplication problem, as follows:


12 feet=12feet∗1 yard3 feet{\displaystyle 12{\text{ feet}}=12{\text{feet}}*{\frac {1{\text{ yard}}}{3{\text{ feet}}}}}



When you write the conversion equation, you need to make sure that you write the conversion fraction so the unit you wish to end up with is in the numerator. If you wrote the conversion fraction as 3 feet1yard{\displaystyle {\frac {3{\text{ feet}}}{1{\text{yard}}}}}, your result would be incorrect. This would be the conversion to use for the inverse conversion, from yards to feet.
 After you write out your conversion equation, the final step is going to be a simple division. You will begin with the unit of feet, and your conversion ratio has feet in the denominator. As with any fraction multiplication, something that appears both in the numerator and the denominator can cancel out of the equation. This will leave just the desired unit of yards.In this example, the problem is set up and can be completed as follows:


12 feet=12feet∗1 yard3 feet=4 yards{\displaystyle 12{\text{ feet}}=12{\text{feet}}*{\frac {1{\text{ yard}}}{3{\text{ feet}}}}=4{\text{ yards}}}




, Many people find that converting measurements is easy, except for remembering whether to multiply or to divide. Emphasizing the conversion ratio and canceling the units helps answer this question every time. Once you get good at converting units, you can skip the conversion ratio and just divide the number of feet by 3 to get an equal measurement in yards.

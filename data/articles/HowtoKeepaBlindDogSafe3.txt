 Whether your dog is outside or inside, use certain keywords to let it know when it’s near something dangerous. For example, say ‘watch’ when your dog is near a set of stairs or a body of water.If you’re comfortable with your dog using the stairs, use ‘step up’ and ‘step down’ to guide it on each stair.Consider using specific keywords, such as ‘tree,’ ‘pool,’ or ‘stairs’ to alert your dog to certain dangerous areas.
Help your dog learn the keywords. For example, say ‘tree’ when your dog is near a tree. Reward your dog when it stops moving and doesn’t move any closer to the tree.
 It may take your dog up to several months to adjust to being blind.During this time, it may occasionally bump into furniture or stumble on the stairs. As your dog adjusts to its blindness, be patient and make your home as safe as you can for your dog.
 Blindness in dogs can be distressing for dog owners. Unfortunately, if you feel stressed or anxious about the blindness, your dog will pick up on those negative emotions.Stay positive and upbeat with your dog, as if it wasn’t blind, so it can more easily adjust to its vision loss.

 For those who can digitally create a font, typically you will have a stylus pen with your mouse pad and can draw the digital letters freehand using the stylus. If you are relying on traditional methods, use good paper and a black marker.;
, Start with the traditional alphabet, but don't be afraid to throw some graphic characters in there as well. Additionally, be sure to add punctuation characters and accent characters.
 After the scanned image is made, clean up dirt and dust, if any.
 Then use a font editor to copy in vector data.
 Kerning is the adjusting of your spacing between the characters to make them proportional as well as aesthetically pleasing.

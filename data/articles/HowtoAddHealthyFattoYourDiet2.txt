 One of the easiest ways to add healthy fats to your diet is to use healthy vegetable-based oils, like olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, corn oil, safflower oil, coconut oil, etc. Try swapping out your usual salad dressing for a dash of oil instead. Instead of cooking with butter, margarine, or lard, use oil. Remember, though — your intake should still be limited. A quarter size drop in the pan is one serving., Avocados are full of healthy fats and are considered a “super food” for partially this reason. 230g of pureed avocado (about one and 1/3 avocados) has a whopping 35g of fat (55% of your recommended daily intake). It has 22.5g of monounsaturated fat, and 4.3g of polyunsaturated fats. Avocados are delicious and healthy!

, Nuts like almonds, peanuts, and walnuts may be high in calories (a ounce of walnuts has 185 calories) but they are high in Omega-3 fatty acids and unsaturated fats.You can also consider eating natural peanut butter or other nut butters. These often are packed full of healthy fats and proteins; however, avoid butters that are high in sugars and salt.
 Seeds like chai and flaxseed are a great source of omega-3 fatty acids.1 tablespoon (10.3 g) of flaxseeds contains 4.3 g of fat (0.4 g saturated, 3 g polyunsaturated, 0.8 monounsaturated) and has 55 calories. The same amount of chia seeds contains about 4 g of fat (0.5 g saturated, 3 g polyunsaturated, 0.25 g monounsaturated) and has 65 calories. Add these to a salad, smoothie, yogurt, or mix them into a bread recipe for an extra boost of healthy fats.

 They should be gathered when they're full but still green in the spring; run your hands down the branch to gather a bunch in your hands.All maple seeds are good to eat, but some are more bitter than others (a good rule of thumb is: small and sweet, big and bitter).Later, when their shells are brown, they are a little more bitter, but still good.;
, Peel off the outer skin (the "whirlygig" part). Cut the end with your thumbnail. Squeeze out the seed; it looks like a pea or bean.
 Taste a few seeds raw. If they are bitter, you'll need to boil them in water, dump out the water, and repeat until the bitterness is gone., If you boiled them already, just season with butter, salt, and pepper and enjoy.If they weren't boiled, here are a few more options:


Roasting - Place the seeds on a cookie sheet and sprinkle with salt. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 8 - 10 minutes.
Drying - Put them in a dry, sunny spot or in a food dehydrator until they are crunchy. They can then be pounded or ground into a flour, if you want.

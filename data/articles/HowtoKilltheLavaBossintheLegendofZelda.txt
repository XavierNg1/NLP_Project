 Volvagia is the final boss of the Fire Temple. If you have played through the Fire Temple, you will have already acquired the boss key; use it to enter the Boss Room where the final boss is.


To find the Boss Room, head to the room on the left side from the main entrance of the temple and you should immediately see the door leading to it.;
, Once you step inside the Boss Room, the ground will start shaking and the ledge you used to get into the room will sink into the lava, leaving you standing alone on a piece of ground at the center of the room.


Volvagia will then come out of the ground and fly into the air. After the introduction, it will dive back into the ground and the battle will begin.
 The dragon will alternately pop its head out of the nine holes on the ground. A small blaze will start spouting out of a hole where its head is about to appear, making it easier to guess.


Once Volvagia’s head emerges from the ground, quickly attack it with your sword and slash away. After damaging it, the dragon will submerge back to the ground.
After taking damage, the dragon will weave its long fire mane at you. So after hitting its head a couple of times, immediately take two steps back to avoid its mane from damaging you.
 Volvagia will now emerge completely out of the ground and fly through the air. Take out your bow and arrow, aim, and shoot at the dragon’s head. Volvagia only flies very slowly so its head is very easy to target.


The lava boss will only come out of the ground and fly through the air if you’ve successfully injured it in step 3.
 After taking damage in mid-air, Volvagia will dive back into the ground and will repeat its attack style mentioned in step 3 and 4. This is the only attack pattern of Volvagia, so just repeat the strategy until the lava boss is defeated.

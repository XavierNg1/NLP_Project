 File hosting services will allow you to upload your file to their servers, and then send the link to that file to your email recipient. The recipient can then visit the link provided, and download the file from the server. Popular hosting services include:


Dropbox – Provides 2 GB free storage, and you can link directly to specific files. Uploading through the website limits files to 300 MB, while using the desktop or mobile app does not have a limit on file size other than your total cap.DropSend – Allows you to send files up to 2 GB, 5 times per month.
WeTransfer – Allows you to send files up to 2 GB, as many times as you’d like.
Send this file – Allows you to send a file up to 2 GB, which can be downloaded up to 3 times for 3 days.;
, If you have multiple files that you need to send to one recipient, it will be much more convenient for the recipient and for you if the files are compressed into a single archive. This will not only reduce the overall file size, but will also save you from having to upload multiple files.


In most cases, you can select multiple files, right-click on the selection, select Send To and then select Archive. For more detailed information on compressing multiple files into one archive, check out this guide.
 The process is different depending on the service. Some services, such as Dropbox, require you to create a free account before you can upload files. Others, like WeTransfer, only need your email and your recipient’s email.


You will need to transfer the entire file to the server before it can be sent. If you are sending a large file and have a slow connection, this could take some time.
 Either send the email through the web service, or send an email containing the link to your file (this depends on the service you are using). Your recipient can then follow the link and download the file to his or her computer.

 You can leave them as they are, or you can use paint, bleaching pens, or studs to add a personal touch.
 After your shorts have dried, you can add some designs using fabric paint and stencils, or fabric markers. Place a sheet of cardboard inside your shorts, so that the paint or marker doesn't bleed through. After this, you can place some adhesive fabric stencils onto your shorts, and fill the spaces in using a paintbrush and fabric paint. You can also draw designs free-handedly using fabric markers. Wait until the paint has dried before taking the cardboard out.
 You can do this with a bleach pen, or by dipping a paintbrush into some undiluted bleach. Simply place a piece of cardboard inside your shorts, and draw some interesting designs onto your shorts. Wait until the designs become as light as you want them to be, then take the cardboard out. Rinse the shorts using soap and cool water, and hang them up to dry.


You can also use this technique to draw designs on unbleached shorts instead.
 The best places to add studs is around the waistband and along the outer edges of the pockets. You can poke them directly into the fabric, and then flatten the prongs using a butter knife, or you can glue them onto the shorts using fabric glue.
 You can do this by simply cutting the bottom hem off. You can leave the shorts as they are, or you can use a sewing machine and sew along the bottom hem so that they do not fray too much. If you choose to sew, sew Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) up the bottom of the cut hem.
 You can create a unique look by distressing your shorts. You can do this by creating a few slices in the lap part using a craft knife and then pulling out the short strands with a pair of tweezers. You can also buff the lap area using a piece of coarse-grained sandpaper or a cheese grinder.

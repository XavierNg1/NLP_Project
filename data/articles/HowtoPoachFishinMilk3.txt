 Pour 2 cups (500ml) of whole milk and 1 pinch of salt in a shallow baking dish. Stir the salt into the milk. Set two skinless fillets of fish, each weighing about 1/3 of a pound (150g) into the baking dish. The milk should come about halfway up the sides of the fish fillets.Depending on the size of your fish, you could use an 8x8 dish. Just ensure that it is heat proof and will fit inside of your microwave.
 Cover the baking dish with the fish and milk with plastic wrap. Take a knife and carefully pierce holes in the plastic wrap. Microwave the fish for 3 minutes on high heat.You could also use a silicone cover or microwaveable lid instead of the plastic wrap.
 Let the fish rest for 1 minute and microwave it for one more minute on high. Carefully pull back the plastic wrap so the steam doesn't burn you. Take a fork and rub it over the surface of the fish. If it's finished, it will flake easily. If not, microwave it for another 30 seconds and check again.You may want to use oven mitts when handling the baking dish. The dish can get very hot, even in the microwave.

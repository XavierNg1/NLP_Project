 Slingshots can be bought from the store for 500 Bells, like the other tools. You can equip it by opening your inventory with X, then dragging it to your character icon, or by pressing the left and right direction buttons.;
, Balloons appear every time the 3DS’s clock hits a time that ends with a 4. It can be 11:34, 3:44, or 5:04, as long as the last digit is 4. They originate from the far edges of your town, so keep an eye out for them. You can usually tell they’ve spawned when you hear a whistling sound.
 Now, when you see one, grab your Slingshot and press A! You might need to chase them down for a bit, but with good timing and persistence, you can definitely down that pesky balloon and loot the rewards.


Just a warning though: if you shoot it down over water or flowers, the present will be destroyed. The present can also be destroyed if it lands in the center of a 3x3 pattern layout. Your character will even make a shocked facial expression when that happens.
If you’re on the town cliffs near the beach, you can pop them with any tool since the balloon will be drifting quite close to the player at this point.
 Pick up the present with Y, then go to your inventory and select the item. Select the “Open” option, and you’ll get a random item from the Balloon Furniture set!


If you’ve popped enough Balloons, sometimes a Toolbox will be attached instead of a present, and will yield a Gold or Silver Slingshot instead. Silver Slingshots fire 2 rocks while Gold ones fire 3.

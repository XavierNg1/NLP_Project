 Your doctor may inject a corticosteroid along with a local anesthetic like Xylocaine. Some doctors may inject Botox into your foot to relax the plantar fascia.
 ESWT uses sound waves to slightly injure the tissues surrounding the heel, which could cause the parts that are causing pain to heal.
 Before performing surgery, doctors usually give home treatments and improved footwear about a year to work. When nothing else eases the pain, here's what you need to know about surgical options:



Instep plantar fasciotomy: Doctors remove part of the plantar fascia to ease pressure on the nerves in your foot.

Endoscopy: This surgery performs the same function as an instep plantar fasciotomy but uses smaller incisions so that you'll heal faster. However, endoscopy has a higher rate of nerve damage, so consider this before you opt for this option.Be prepared to wear a below-the-knee walking cast to ease the pain of surgery and to speed the healing process. These casts, or "boots," usually work better than crutches to speed up your recovery time.

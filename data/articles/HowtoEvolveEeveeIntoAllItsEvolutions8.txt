 Eevee will naturally evolve into Sylveon if certain important conditions are met. The first of these is that the Eevee must know at least one Fairy-type move. You can catch a wild Eevee with Baby-Doll Eyes (Level 19), or use the move tutor to relearn it.
 Using the care tool in your game, feed the Eevee and play with it until it gets two affection hearts. Your Eevee's current hearts can be seen when selecting another Pok√©mon to play with.

If you are playing Sun and Moon, using a Rainbow Poke Bean will guarantee the friendliness of your Eevee to go up 2 or even 3 affection hearts.
 Get into battles and use your Eevee until it gains a level. If both of the conditions above are met, it should evolve into a Sylveon!


Sylveon's highest stats are Special Defense and Special Attack. Its ability Cute Charm has a chance of infatuating opponents of the opposite gender if they use a contact move on it.

 A nonprofit called the Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation maintains a list of regional recycling centers that you can use to get rid of rechargeable batteries without adding additional heavy metals and chemicals to landfills. These centers often accept Nickel Cadmium batteries as well as other kinds like Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) and Lithium-Ion (Li-ion), making them a one-stop shop for disposing of your used batteries.

 Short of actually seeing your cat having a nosebleed, there may be evidence present on your cat’s nose that they are experiencing them. Look for swelling around the area, pus coming out of your cat’s nostrils, or bruising on the nose. If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your veterinarian immediately as nosebleeds can be a sign of injury or serious illnesses such as:Cancer
Anemia
Kidney failure
Blood clotting disorders
Bacterial infection
Dental abscess

, Chapped or flaking skin could be a sign of a dermatological problem in your cat. If you observe this symptom for more than a few days, contact your veterinarian. Dry skin on your cat's nose can also be attributed to:Time spent near a heater or other heat source
Poor air circulation
Sun exposure
Dried saliva from licking its nose

, A cat's nose can vary in temperature and wetness, which generally are not a cause for concern. Most cats have moist, cool noses, but dryness does not usually indicate a serious issue unless accompanied by a fever. Sudden wetness, however, could be a sign of an upper respiratory infection.If your cat's nose in unusually wet, observe it for a day or two and look for other URI symptoms (e.g. red or watery eyes). Bring your cat to the vet if the runny nose persists.
 It is not unusual for cats to have runny noses, but the discharge should be clear. Check for thick, bubbling, or dark discharge (yellow, green, or black), which could be the sign if an infection. If you notice this dark mucus, contact your veterinarian immediately for an exam., If your cat's nose is expelling mucus, look for other symptoms that might provide an explanation. Observe your cat and note any sneezing, panting, or difficulty breathing. These symptoms could be indicative of a respiratory infection or other illness.

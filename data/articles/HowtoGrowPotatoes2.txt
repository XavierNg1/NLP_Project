 About a week before you plan to plant the potatoes, set the seeds in a sunny, warm spot in your home. This will help them start to sprout and prepare them to grow into potato plants.


A couple of days before planting, slice the larger seeds into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Each piece should contain two eyes. The smaller seeds can be planted whole.
If the seeds are viable, a thick callous will form over the cuts to protect them once they have been planted.
 Cultivate the soil in your potato patch by using gardening tools to turn it and remove any rocks and roots. When it is nice and loose,


Mix in some organic compost to make the soil especially hospitable for the potatoes.
Create rows. Dig a trench 4 inches (10.2 cm) wide and 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep, then a second trench of the same dimensions a couple of feet from the first trench.
Create a mound. If you don't have space for rows, you can plant potatoes in mounds. Dig out a circular area about 3 feet (0.9 m) wide and 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep.
 Press the seeds into the trench you dug cut side down, leaving about 12 inches (30.5 cm) between seeds.


Either line them up along rows or place them around the circular trench, depending on the method you are using.
Cover the seeds with 4 inches (10.2 cm) of soil. Don't fill in the trench entirely; it should still be lower than the surrounding area.

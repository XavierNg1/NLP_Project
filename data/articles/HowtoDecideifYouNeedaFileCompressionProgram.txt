 Instead of spending money on flash drives, disks and extra computer memory in order to store all of your data, you can compress files and store information in much less space.
Transmit files faster over a slower Internet connection. If you have a slow Internet connection and you've ever tried to download a video or image from the Internet, you know that it can take a considerable amount of time and can sometimes even freeze your operating system up, making it impossible to use your computer during the download.
Manage and organize archives. If you have a lot of data that you want to store, but that you know you won't be using for a long time, creating ZIP files and storing and/or transferring them all to one place is a great way to manage your data and your space.
Preserve hard disk space. If you must download and store a bulk of information, it will take up your computer's memory and eventually result in a slow-moving, inefficient operating system. Using a file compression program frees up your computer's memory by preserving much-needed hard disk space.
Send large amounts of information via email. Email programs often have limits regarding the amount of data you can attach and send in 1 email message. Attaching ZIP files allows you to send much more data via email, and at a faster rate.;

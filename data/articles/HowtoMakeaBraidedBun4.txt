 Take a small section of hair near the crown of your head (a 1-2 inch section of hair), and back comb it, pushing the hair down with your comb.Flip the back combed section of hair over to the front of you face. Take the section of hair behind the first section of hair you just back combed, and back comb that section.


Tease and back comb about 3-4 sections of hair. Then flip all of your hair back so it lays naturally.
 Separate your hair into three vertical sections: one for the right side, one for the left side, and one in the middle of your hair.Tie each section near the nape of your neck with a ponytail holder.
 Loosely braid each section of hair in a classic three-strand braid.Secure each braid at the end of the hair with a small, elastic hair tie.
 Hold one braided section at the bottom near the hair tie, and use your other hand to twist the middle portion of the braid. The twisting motion is similar to the motion you would do if you were going to knot the braid on itself.Secure the twisted braid with some bobby pins.


Continue to twist and secure the other two braided sections of hair, so they line up near each other once secured into place.

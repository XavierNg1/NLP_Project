 Ask for it at a nursery or garden center that specializes in pond plant varieties.


To propagate: If you have the plant in your pond, or a friend or neighbor does, snip off a little piece. It grows readily once added to water.;
, Being a pond plant, it needs something that replicates a pond. A deep wide bowl is idea. A clear bowl is good, as it will help transfer more light to the plant and you can see the plant growth more easily.
 Let the water stand for a few hours to evaporate off any added chemicals, like chlorine.
 Keep the water level up; it mustn't run out of water or it will die.


The plant will keep the water clean itself, so you won't need to take care of that. Just make sure it gets enough water all the time––it's ideal for people who tend to overwater their plants!

, This plant will thrive provided it has access to plenty of bright light. This makes the windowsill an ideal place but any safe bench, shelf or other position in a brightly lit room will probably provide adequate growing conditions.
 The plant will rapidly spread across the bowl. If this causes a crowding problem, trim as needed and discard the trimmed pieces or return them to your pond outside.

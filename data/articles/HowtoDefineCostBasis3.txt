 This method is typically used for mutual fund accounts.This method adds up the cost basis for all of your assets and divides it by your total number of fund shares to calculate an average cost basis., Suppose you purchased 100 XYZ fund shares for $5,000 ($50 per share), 100 fund shares for $3,000 ($30 per share) and 100 fund shares for $1,000 ($10 per share). This year you sold 50 XYZ shares for $3,000.


Total the cost for all of the XYZ fund shares ($5,000 + $3,000 + $1,000 = $9,000).
Add up the total number of shares (100 + 100 + 100 = 300).
Calculate the average cost per share ($9,000 / 300 = $30).
The average cost per share is $30. You will use $30 per share for your cost basis.
Since you sold 50 shares, you multiply the cost basis per share by 50 to calculate the total cost basis (50 x $30 = $1,500).
 Subtract your cost basis for the 50 shares from the selling price for the 50 shares. The difference will be your capital gain or loss. This gain or loss is used for your taxes.


You sold the 50 shares for $3,000. Subtract to get the difference using the equation $3,000 - $1,500 = $1,500.
Your capital gain in this example is $1,500.
 Your gains and losses are spread evenly across all of the shares you own. It’s also easy to use since the calculation of the average cost is automated. This method involves little record-keeping. Your mutual fund house or stock broker can easily do the calculation for you., You don’t have as much control over how much of a gain or loss is reported to the IRS for taxes. Because your gains and losses are spread evenly across all the assets you own, you can’t hand select which shares to include in the calculation. Also, this method is tax inefficient. Since the same cost basis is used for all of your assets, you can’t maximize gains or minimize losses for tax purposes.

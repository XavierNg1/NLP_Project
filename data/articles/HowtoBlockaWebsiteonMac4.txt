 These controls are already built into you computer's operating system (the software that essentially runs your computer).This method might be the easiest, but it's just as effective as the others. And it requires far less technical know-how.


From your computer's Apple menu, go to System Preferences.
Go to Parental Control.
Click on the lock symbol on the bottom left side. Enter your administrator password.
Click on the guest account on the left side bar.

Please be aware that you will not have the option of setting up blocking controls for the administrator (likely yourself). The administrator's account will therefore not appear on the left side.
 Once you are in Parental Controls, you will notice a few option tabs at the top of your window: Apps, Web, People, Time Limits, and Other.


Click on the Web option. You will note three other options: Allow unrestricted access to websites, Try to limit access to adult websites automatically, and Allow access to these websites only. The last option has a Customize button below it. This is the option with the widest blocking range, and likely best suited for this task.
Click the Customize button. A new window will appear divided into two sections: Always allow these websites, and Never allow these websites.
Go to Never allow these websites and click on the + button on the bottom left side. Now, simply type in the website(s) you wish to block. Example: www.facebook.com.

You could also choose Allow access to only these websites. It might it a bit too restrictive, but this way, you'll block anything that isn't specifically approved by you.


Click OK on the bottom right side of the window.
 Now, type in an address you wanted to remove into Safari. The page will come back as blank, or with an Access restricted notice.

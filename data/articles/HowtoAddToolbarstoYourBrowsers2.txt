 Double-click the browserâ€™s shortcut icon on your desktop to launch it.
 Once at the Internet Explorer window, click on the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the window.


This will show you some options, but most importantly, it will show you the different toolbars that you can activate or disable in the browser.
 Choose between the Favorites Bar, Menu Bar, Command Bar, and Status Bar.
 Click on a toolbar you want to activate, and it will show a check mark on the left side of the toolbar name. This means that you have turned on the toolbar that you have selected.
 If you want to hide a toolbar, click it again in the gear menu to remove the check mark and disable the toolbar.

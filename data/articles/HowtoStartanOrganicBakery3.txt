 Nothing is safe from a fluctuating economy, especially not the food industry. Know that the cost of ingredients will change over time. Sometimes this will be to your benefit, but oftentimes, it won't be. You cannot pass the cost onto your customers each time there is a slight increase, though. Otherwise, you will likely end up losing customers instead of gaining them.
 Menu changes can occur when a particular item fails to make a profit, but they can also occur when in particular ingredient goes up in price and is no longer affordable.
 Due to the high cost of organic ingredients, organic baked goods must also cost more. While obscenely high costs will drive away potential customers, extraordinarily low costs may make your customers doubt the quality of your goods. If the ingredients are top notch and you have baking skills that can woo your customers, do not be afraid to make your prices competitive.
 Place general advertisements in newspapers and online to reach the greatest number of potential customers, but focus on a client base that is likely to appreciate your dedication to organic goods. Ask to advertise at local farmer's markets, especially if you purchase a number of your ingredients there.
 Organic bakeries and other businesses in the organic food industry often fall victim to the "angry vegan" stereotype. Avoid actions that suggest pretentiousness, like decorating your establishment with bold political signs or "anti-" signs like "anti-meat" or "anti-fur." Keep the setting neutral and focus on serving your customers instead of making a statement.
 This is especially important when you are starting out, since your customers can tell you better than anyone what they want and need.

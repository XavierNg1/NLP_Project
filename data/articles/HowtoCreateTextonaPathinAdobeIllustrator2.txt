 Select the Type on a Path Tool as before in Method 1.
 Again, use the brackets and perpendicular icon to drag the text along the circle or flip the text inside the circle.
 Repeat the same steps to create text on a square, polygon, or even a spiral (hidden tool on the flyout menu for the Line Segment Tool (\) in the Tools Panel). Adjust the size of the font based on the shape and have fun experimenting!

 See how your teen does with these rules for six months. Note if they break any of your rules and penalize them accordingly. If they show they can follow your rules for six months and do not break any of them, you may decide to revisit the rules. Discuss any changes in the rules only when you are comfortable with your teen as a driver and when they have earned your trust.


For example, after six months you may extend your teen’s curfew by half an hour or one hour so they can stay out later and drive home on their own. Or you may give your teen more access to the car to run errands on their own after six months of following your rules.
 You may also decide to wait until your teen earns their permanent driver’s license, which they will do after several years of driving. In most states, drivers have to take a road test to get their permanent driver’s license. Once your teen does this, you may then loosen up the rules on the car a little bit.Depending on your finances, you may offer to help your teen buy a car once they earn their permanent driver’s license. Doing this will show your teen you trust them and consider them a responsible driver.
 As your teen gets the hang of driving and ventures out with the car on their own, you as a parent should be a good driving model for them. Maintain your composure when you are in the car with your teen and be a good driver when you are behind the wheel. Modeling good driving behavior will help your teen learn about road safety and ensure they pick up good driving habits.If you notice your teen making a driving mistake when you are in the car with them, be sure to point it out and offer advice or feedback. Doing this will ensure you are a good driving model even when you are not driving and teach your teen the correct way to drive on the road.

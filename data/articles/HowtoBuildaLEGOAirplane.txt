 Choose better choices so it won't take so long and be so hard to build the LEGO airplane. Better choices for the size of the LEGOs mostly counts:


Small LEGOs might make building a LEGO airplane harder, and it will take longer too. Make sure if you want to work hard, you pick the small LEGOs.
Big LEGOs make it easier to make the LEGO airplane, and won't take as much time to finish it. These kinds of LEGOs are good for beginners, but might make the airplane look too big.;
, Keep stacking these LEGOs on top of each other with skinny LEGOs. Use LEGOs on the back of the other, if the first LEGO is not five inches. Build until you think it looks the right way you want it.


For big LEGOs, you might not have to stack them on top of each other because they are already big, and they might reach five inches in one big block.
 Big LEGOs might not work for this.
 Add blue pieces of LEGO on the side, the back, and the front.
 Use LEGO wheels and axles to do this. Stick four axles under and stick the wheels through. Wheels will be for landing and taking off.

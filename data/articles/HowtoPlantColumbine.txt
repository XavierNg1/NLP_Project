 These plants grow best in an area that gets full sun in the morning and partial shade in the afternoon. If you are unsure of the sort of light your area will receive, watch it for a few days and chart the sun exposure to determine if growing columbine in that area will provide optimal conditions for your plant.;
, This flower thrives in soil that is well drained and rich in nutrients. Porous, slightly alkaline soils are the most favorable for newer plants, but once the columbine is well established in a garden, it grows well in nearly any soil condition.


To ensure the soil has the right amount of nutrients at the time of planting columbine, add some fertilizer right away. You can continue to fertilize your plant monthly throughout the growing season to create a healthy root system and larger, more vibrant flowers.
 The seeds must have a few weeks of cold before they can germinate, so keep seed packets in the refrigerator for 3 or 4 weeks before planting. People in colder climates also plant their seeds outdoors in the fall and let them germinate naturally in the spring.
 Because these plants also attract bees and hummingbirds, some people planting prefer columbines near windows where they can watch the wildlife. Columbines require a potting soil rich in nutrients and sufficient diameter in the pot to spread up to 1 foot (0.3Â m). Container plants tend to dry out more often, so frequent watering is also essential to keep plants in top condition.

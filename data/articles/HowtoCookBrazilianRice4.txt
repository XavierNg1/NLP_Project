 Pour the oil into a large saucepan and heat it on the stove over a medium setting.


Wait 30 seconds, or until the oil becomes glossy and thin enough to coat the bottom of the pan.
 Add the onion and garlic to the hot oil. Cook the two ingredients for about 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently.


The garlic and onion should be fragrant and soft, but they should not begin to brown.
Keep a close eye on the two ingredients as you cook them. If they burn, the burnt flavor will likely get into the flavor of the rice and may ruin it.
 Place the chopped broccoli in the pan with the onion and garlic. Stir the ingredients together until evenly distributed.


Only use the crowns or heads of the broccoli. Do not use stems for this recipe.
For best results, make sure that the broccoli is chopped into very fine pieces. Doing so will help keep the final cook time lower.
 Cover the pan and let the vegetables "sweat" for about 3 minutes.


In essence, you are allowing the vegetables to steam cook in their own moisture during this step. This will only be effective if all of the vegetables have been previously chopped or minced into very fine pieces, though.
The broccoli must be tender when this step is finished. If the broccoli does not feel tender after 3 minutes, cover the pan again and let it cook longer.
 Pour the hot, cooked rice into the pan with the vegetables and stir well to combine. Cook the rice for a minute or two, allowing it to deepen in color.


Unlike other Brazilian rice recipes, note that the rice in this recipe must be previously cooked before you add it to the pan.
Any long grain white rice is suitable for this recipe.
For best results, use freshly cooked rice that is still fairly hot.
 Sprinkle the contents of the pan with salt. Mix the salt in, then let the contents of the pan warm thoroughly.
 Once everything is steaming hot, the rice should be ready to serve and should be enjoyed immediately for the best flavor.

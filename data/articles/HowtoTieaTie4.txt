 Make sure the wider end is on the right, and about 14 inches (36 cm) lower than the thinner side on the left.The Windsor knot uses a lot of cloth, so the lower end should start a bit lower than you would usually position a tie.


Many consider the large, symmetric Windsor knot the most elegant and formal option. Wear it with a spread or wide spread collar., Hold one end in each hand, then pass each of them to the opposite hand. The wide end should now be on your left side.
 Using your right hand, hold the two ends where they cross near your collar. With your left hand, pull the wide end up through the neck loop from below.
 Rest the wide end back on your chest, to the left of the narrow end.
 Grab the wide end with your right hand and pull it back to the right side of your body, under the narrow end. Hold the knot near your collar in place with your left hand.
 Keep it on the right side.
 Insert the tip of the wide end and pull through, still on the right side. The underside of the wide end should now be facing forward.
 Fold it back over from right to left, so the front side is visible again.
 Bring the wide end back up through the neck loop one last time.
 Place the wide end through the horizontal knot at the front of the tie. Pull it through.
 Hold the base of the front knot and squeeze gently from the sides. Slowly pull the wide end of the tie to bring the knot closer to the neck.

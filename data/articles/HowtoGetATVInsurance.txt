 Some states require an ATV policy for anybody who owns one, with a requisite minimum amount of protection. Others don't legally mandate the coverage.;
, Off-road vs. on-road, the number of wheels, and whether or not it's specified for passengers will all play a role in your ATV insurance.


Purchasing the wrong kind of insurance for your ATV may invalidate the policy. You'll be responsible for damages and repairs personally and out of your own pocket.
If you're not certain about the insurance and vehicle classification for your ATV, consult with the dealership where you bought it.
 This will help you make sure you get the best price for your coverage.


Talk with the insurance agent or company that provides your current auto, homeowner's, life and other insurance policies. Most companies will grant multi-line discounts that will save you on the premiums for your ATV policy.
Get some quotes from insurance companies that specialize in high-risk, recreational vehicle and ATV policies. By serving a niche market, these companies can cut costs that equate to quicker and less expensive service for you.
Compare only similar policies when doing your price analysis. For example, it's not helpful to compare a policy against another with half the maximum coverage.
 Damage in ATV accidents is more likely to ding up your vehicle than do actionable damage to other people's property.
 Although a low deductible saves you short-term money if you make a claim, a high deductible will reduce your monthly premiums on your ATV insurance enough to make up for up to one accident per year.

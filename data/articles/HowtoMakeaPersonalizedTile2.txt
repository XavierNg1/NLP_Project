 Trim the image with scissors or a craft knife so that the paper edges are at least .25 inch (.635 cm) away from the tile's edges.
 This prevents tiles from sticking to the table after you apply glue.
, Press firmly on the paper with your thumbs, beginning in the center and working your way to the edges.
 Work fast since craft glue dries rapidly.


Ensure the edges are completely tacked down or the image will not adhere.
 Allow the glue to dry at least 15 minutes.
 Brushing in one direction only, paint around the edges and along the sides of the tile.


Use the softest paintbrush you can find. Your brushstrokes will appear when the glue dries.
 Add another layer, but paint it on using brush strokes in the opposite direction. This gives a textured appearance on the surface.


Reapply another coating after each previous layer dries. The amount of layers depends on your personal preference; more layers will create a heavier, textured effect.
Wait for your craft glue coating to dry. Check the bottle for drying times.
 Spray a light coat of clear finish over each tile. Allow to dry based on the product's drying times.
 Measure the felt so each piece covers the back of a tile.


Apply the felt to the back of each tile using glue from a hot glue gun.
Place each tile upside down. Wait until dry before handling.

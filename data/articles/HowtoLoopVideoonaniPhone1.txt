 In order to loop a single video, you will need to create a new album that contains only the material you wish to have looped. You can do this by going to your Photos app and selecting the plus sign in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. You will then be asked to select the photos or videos you want to be contained in the album after you have named it.;
, This is the silver icon with a cog on your home screen.
 This selection should be near the bottom of the Settings menu.
 Under "Photos & Camera," scroll down to the subheading entitled "Slideshow" and turn "Repeat" on.
 When you play the video, select the box with an up arrow in the bottom left-hand corner of your screen. You may need to tap your screen in order for the date, time, and task bars to appear.
 After you select the box with the up arrow, make sure that the video you want to loop has a blue check mark in the lower right-hand corner and then select "Next." From the window that appears, you will have the option to select "Slideshow."

, A screen will appear entitled "Slideshow Options" where you will have the ability to choose the transitions you would like as well as the music you would like to play in the background. Make your choices and then press "Start Slideshow." Your video will now be looped.

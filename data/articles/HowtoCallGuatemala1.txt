 Every country has what is called an exit code. It's the number you dial in order to direct a call outside the country. In the United States and Canada, the exit code is "011." If calling from the US or Canada, dial these numbers first.If you're not from the United States or Canada, you can find your country's exit code online. For example, the United Kingdom's exit code is "00.";
, In addition to having an exit code, every country has a unique country code. This is the code you type after the exit code to indicate which country you're trying to reach. Guatemala's exit code is "502." Dial this after the exit code.For example, if you're calling from the United States, you would dial, "011-502."

, After you dial the exit and country code, punch in the number you're trying to reach in Guatemala. Your phone call should be directed to the country.For example, if you're trying to reach the number "1234-5678," you would dial, "011-502-1234-5678."

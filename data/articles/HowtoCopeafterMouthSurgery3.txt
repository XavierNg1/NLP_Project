 Creamy soups are good sources of nutrients and calories following surgery, provided they’re not too hot. Smooth yogurts, custard, and milkshakes are also easy to drink. After you heal a bit, you can indulge in mashed potatoes, soft cheese, baked beans, rice pudding, puréed fruit, and smoothies.


Avoid smoothies or purées containing strawberries or other fruits with small seeds. These can get stuck in surgical wounds.
 Keep it lukewarm until your teeth and gums stop being so sensitive. Light cooling has a numbing effect, so small pieces of ice or ice cream when carefully used can have a soothing effect on swelling. Additionally, remember that salty foods, as well as very acidic foods or drinks will cause stinging to surgical wounds., It can be particularly difficult to get enough protein during your recovery time. Consider acquiring or making your own smoothies with milk fortified with additional protein, peanut butter, or powdered protein. Pasteurized eggs or egg whites are also good sources of protein, and butter, vegetable oils, or avocado can be added for additional calories.Consider eating baby food as well to ensure you’re getting proper nutrition during recovery.

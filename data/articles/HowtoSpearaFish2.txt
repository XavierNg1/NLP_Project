Pole spears made of aluminum work well on larger fish., Spearguns are generally used by more advanced fishers and which speargun you decide to use depends on the type of fish that you want to hunt. Each type of speargun, regardless of the manufacturer, feels different in different environments, so it can be very difficult to choose.While you can decide between pneumatic guns, wood guns, and euro guns, you may not know which type of of gun is best until you have had practice with various types of guns. Beginners should start with a small speargun. It is best to start with the less expensive model.
 Consider placing an extra pole spear or speargun in your kayak or boat so that you do not get all of the way to your destination and have to turn around because of a problem with the equipment.

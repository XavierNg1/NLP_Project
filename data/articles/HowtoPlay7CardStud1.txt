 Each player who is participating in the game must ante up an agreed-upon amount before being dealt cards.;
, Deal the cards one at a time in clockwise fashion beginning with the player on your left. Give each player 3 cards. Deal the first 2 cards face down and the third card face up. This card is the door card. The player with the lowest door card must make the first bet. This is called the bring-in bet and can be either half the game minimum or a full bet. Other players then call, raise or fold.
 Deal each player a fourth card. This is called the 4th Street card. This time, the player with the highest card/best card showing leads the betting. The player can either check or bet. Other players, beginning with the one to the left of the player who opened betting, decide whether to fold, check or raise.
 Play these rounds like the 4th Street round. Deal only to players who haven't folded. The player with the highest card/best hand showing leads the betting. In the final 3 rounds of betting, players must make the maximum bet.
 This is the last card dealt in 7 Card Stud. When betting concludes, players reveal their hands. The winner collects the pot for this game.

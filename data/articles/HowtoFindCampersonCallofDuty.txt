,, Hiding in darkness is a common move for campers.
 Sometimes, the camper will stay in the exact same spot after they kill you. This will make it easy to get revenge.
 The campers can wear ghillies and hide (Black Ops 2 excluded).
 Even if the campers stand still, their character's head and arms will move.
 You need to do this because there is a trick called YYing, and if a player rapidly taps Y (or triangle), they will not move at all. This is even more dangerous if they use Assassin. Check those corpses! Remember that dealing with campers is a lot harder if they move around.
 Campers love to use these, so you should avoid them. If the only way in is blocked, shoot it. This will alert them to your position.
, Make finding and killing the campers as easy as possible for yourself.

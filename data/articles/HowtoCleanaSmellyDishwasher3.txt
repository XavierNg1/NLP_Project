 Most dishwashers will come with manuals that include troubleshooting sections that include specific cleaning instructions in just this kind of situation.


Many dishwasher manuals are also available online for free. Websites such as ManualsOnline.com and ManualsLib.com are just a few of the many sites that have downloadable manuals for a variety of home appliances.
 Especially check into this if there is water in the bottom of your dishwasher at the end of a cycle. It the drain hose has become bent or restricted, the flow of water can be limited and built-up water can become musty in the hose.


If the dishwasher can be pulled away from the wall, do so to check the hose.
Most other dishwashers will be located next to the kitchen sink will have drain hoses that connect to the same kitchen drain pipe. You can detach the hose at whichever end is easier to access in order to inspect it.
 Waste water from the sink can drain through the hose into the dishwasher if the drain hose is not looped up from the drain pipe before it is run to the dishwasher. The weight of a sink-full of water can push water back up through the dishwasher drain hose. If this appears to be a problem, raise the loop of the drain hose higher.
 Examine the junction box behind the kick plate under the door of the dishwasher. A poor connection can produce an odor and is a fire hazard. Other problems can come from shorts in any of the electrical lines or a dysfunctional heater unit. If the dishwasher appears to have electrical problem, unplug it and call an electrician to fix the problem.

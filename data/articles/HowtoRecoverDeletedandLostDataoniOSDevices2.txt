 Carry out the initial set-up instructions when you turn your phone on.



If your phone is already set up and you're trying to restore from iCloud, you'll need to erase your phone data and go through the Setup Assistant again., You can select "Settings" and then "General," "Reset," and "Erase All Content and Settings" to do this. Beware that if you don't have a backup, you'll lose all your data!

Normally you won't see any change, but the brush has been created.
 The brush should show up. If it does not then right click on the page/canvas. A box with lot of brushes will come, scroll down at the bottom and at last place will be the brush. Hover over it the name will be shown.
 You can make the custom brush even more custom by going to Brush Presets Window > Brush.
 This technique will allow you to create flames of fire, sparkles, etc.

 Especially if you are having this as a birthday party, you need to confirm with your parents/guardians how much money you are going to spend. Remember to check in a few different stores before buying decorations and food; you may find somewhere that sells stuff for a much cheaper price.;
, You might want to have food - like cake - and decorations all linked to the same idea. Here is my favourite theme idea:Disney - You can watch a Disney movie, get some cheap Minnie and Mickey Mouse decorations, put on the Frozen soundtrack CD*1 or Now that's what I call Disney CD*2 and dance along, dress up as Disney characters and maybe even plead for a Disney cake!*1: £10.99 in Disney Store/£7.00 in Claires. *2: £12.59 from base.com

, As you're girls (unless if you couldn't read 'For young girls' bit at the top), I suggest inviting only girls to the sleepover - it can get out of hand if boys come. Also, don't invite anyone who you don't get on with because if you fall out, it's unlikely that her parents will get out of bed to fetch her!

, The most original method is to use paper invitations which you can buy or make yourself. If you have a theme, try to find or make invites that somehow link to the theme you have chosen.
 Depending on your budget, it's a good idea to choose food that everyone enjoys. Pizza is a great choice: if you're tight on cash, you can buy a pack of pizza bases from somewhere like Tesco and find enough ingredients around your house to customize your own pizzas, you could order Domino's if there is enough money or, if you're prepared to splash the cash a bit, you could try taking your friends out to a restaurant. Now onto decorations. Poundland and 99p Store are great places to go if you want to liven up your house but your budget is low, but party pieces and party delights have a wide range of themed decorations if you are ready to give more than £1.

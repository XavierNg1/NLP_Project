 Wear flowing dresses skirts and tops. The main colors a forest nymph would wear are brown and green or other natural looking colors, a forest nymph would never wear bright or neon clothes unless they're yellow (that represents the sun). Nymphs are very passive so neutral colors like white and earthy tones are good too.
 Forest nymphs are strong and active so take up a sport and exercise, but don't push yourself too hard. Become active little by little until you achieve you goal.
 Being able to climb trees well is a great way to be a nymph. Nymphs are known to jump out of trees and scare people, don't give someone a heart attack but make sure to learn how to jump from higher branches, make sure not to hurt yourself, start low down and gradually get higher up the tree. Remember, nymphs are not invincible so be sensible and careful and don't try to jump from too high up.
 Nymphs are always themselves, they are usually shy but there can be odd nymphs out too. Don't be afraid to be you!

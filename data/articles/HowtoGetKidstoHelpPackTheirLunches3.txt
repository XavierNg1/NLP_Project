 Make sure you kids know exactly what the consequences are for not packing their lunch. For instance, you could institute a "three strikes rule," where if they don't pack their lunch three times in a week, they lose privileges.Be firm with your limits for rewards. Even if your kids beg or throw a tantrum, calmly remind them of the rules and their decision to not follow them. Stick to your limits.
 This is a great skill for kids to learn even at a young age. Privileges, like TV time, video game time, and even sports, cost money. Even though your kids can't contribute money, they can help out by packing their own lunches. Some privileges you might have your children earn through lunch packing include:


Doing a hobby (like chess, music, model building, etc.)
Participating in sports
Playing tabletop games (like board games or cards)
Playing video games
Playing with friends
Watching TV, This is good way to encourage consistency in your kids. By setting a weekly or monthly reward for not missing a day of lunch packing, you'll encourage your kids to pack their lunches every day. Some ideas for weekly and monthly rewards include:


A favorite dinner or desert
A new video game
A new book
A small party with friends
A trip to the movie theatre

, Many children respond well to visual confirmation of their progress. Display a calendar or progress board on a visible surface, like on your refrigerator or a prominent wall.


You may want to use a special colored felt tipped marker, stickers, stamps, or some other similar marker to indicate on your calendar or progress chart when your kids have completed their lunch making responsibility.
By using a calendar or progress chart, your children will not only be reminded of their lunch making responsibility, but they'll also see the direct correlation between their efforts and their progress.

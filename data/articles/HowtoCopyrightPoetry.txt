 Copyright Office (CO). There are 3 ways to register basic claims:


Register online through eCO (electronic Copyright Office). This option is the preferred way because it costs less, it's faster, you can track your status online, and payment method is secure. Go to http://www.copyright.gov/ and click on "Registration."
Register basic claims with Fill-in Form CO. This option uses a barcode scanning technology. For literary works, complete the Form TX on your computer, print and mail. The forms are available at http://www.copyright.gov/forms/.

Register using paper forms. You can request a copy and they will be sent in the mail. You need to request Form TX for literary works and send them to Library of Congress, U.S. Copyright Office, 101 Independence Avenue SE, Washington DC 20559-6222.;

Fee for registration using eCO is $35 for a basic claim. You can either pay with an electronic check or use debit or credit card at Pay.gov
For Forms CO, the fee is $50 and Form TX with paper filing is $65. Send your check or money order.



For online registration using eCO, you can upload categories of your deposit or attach an electronic file of a copy of your deposit. If you don't have an electronic copy or need to send the hard copy, print a shipping slip, attach it to your deposit and mail the deposit to U.S. Copyright Office at the address above.
If you're using Form CO or paper filing, you must mail the form and include the fee and deposit in the same package to U.S. Copyright Office at the address above.

The leak will generally come from the discharge hose at the standpipe in the wall. Are there water stains running down the wall? Perhaps, when you turn the machine to drain, water comes out of the standpipe.
Adjust the drainage hose if you suspect an obstructed flow or stopped up drain.
Another common water leak can be a bad hose or loose connection. Pull out the washing machine and turn it on, allowing water to flow into the tub. Check at the back to ensure there are no cuts in the hose or at the connections as the tub fills.
There are two hoses that are part of the cycle system. Check as it cycles to verify the clamps and hoses are in good condition.;

You need to remove the bottom panel from the washing machine using a Phillips head screwdriver.
Possible leaks can be hidden under the washtub.
 This would make water come from around the top of the washtub during the spin cycle.


Raise the top of the washing machine to check the gasket. It is normally held in place with two clips in the front. Insert a thin-bladed flat head screwdriver and pry the top up. The two clips are at the back and act like hinges.
With the top up, visually inspect the gasket around the top of the tub for cracks, dirt or anything else that would keep it from sealing off the water.

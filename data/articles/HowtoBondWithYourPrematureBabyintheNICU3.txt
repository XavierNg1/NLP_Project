 This can be a helpful method to assist you in feeling a bit more relaxed. Nothing is going to make you forget that your baby is hooked up to machines in a tiny incubator instead of at home in his crib. However, by learning how to relax, you can see past those machines and really look at the joy of your tiny baby.



If you are able to hold your baby, tune out all of the beeping monitors and really focus on holding your little one. Take advantage of this time to bond with him. Feel his skin, touch his hair, wiggle his toes...all of these moments can strengthen the parent-child bond.
If you cannot hold your baby, sit near his isolette and direct your focus to him and only him. Tune out all the noises around you and pay attention to every move or noise he makes.
 When you are with your baby, do not get distracted by anything else. Turn off your cellphone and leave the world outside of the NICU behind you. When bonding with your baby, do not focus on his medical condition or worry about how he is doing. Save that for later when you speak with the doctors. Instead, focus completely on enjoying the precious moments that you get to spend with your baby.
 Chances are that your NICU baby will be sleeping most of the time. When he is awake, be sure to make eye contact with him. This can help with the bonding process and make your baby feel more comfortable. This is especially important for babies who cannot yet be held by their parents.

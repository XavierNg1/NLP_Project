 Decide why you want to impact people, and whether there is a specific group of people that you want to impact.
 For five minutes, (or more), write down everything you can think of about the group you most want to impact.


Are there any organizations in your area that help them?
Do you personally know anyone who is in that group or helps people in that group?
Is there anything you can do on your own?
Is this group in need of monetary donations?

, For another five minutes, (or more) research the group you want to help and the answers to the questions above online. Bookmark any really good pages you come across. , Take another piece of paper and make a list in order of all the things you have come across that you could do to help (including raise money). Put them in order of how much they would impact your group if you successfully completed them.
 Organize this one in order of how easy they will be to complete.
 Using the other two lists to help you, make a list in order of how they would be worth your time. Ex. if there is something easy and quick with a lot of impact, that should go at the top of your list.
 Go out and starting from the top of your list, do as many things on it as you can.

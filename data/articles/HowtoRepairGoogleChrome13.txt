 A simple way to fix this is by going to Chrome's Settings ("chrome://settings/" in the address bar) and opening the Advanced Settings at the bottom of the page. Once you reach the bottom, there will be a checkbox under System that reads "Use hardware acceleration when available". Make sure this box is not selected (or empty). After this is done, clear all browsing data (Ctrl+Shift+Delete) and restart Chrome. This should solve the video issue, but if it doesn't, be sure to check "chrome://conflicts/" and/or make sure all drivers are up to date.

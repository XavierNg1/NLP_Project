 A bossy person seeks to throw you off balance so that you are easily controlled. Your first line of defense is to take a deep breath, which activates your body's natural calming response. This will keep you in control of your actions, and the situation as a whole., There is a difference between being assertive and being aggressive. You should express your opinions and feelings on an issue and hold your ground. This is not an invitation to attack or turn the tables on your friend.Use phrases like “I can make this decision for myself,” instead of things like “Shut up! I’ll do what I want.”

, Letting a friend pressure you into doing something that you disagree with can negatively affect your self esteem. Value yourself as a person enough to feel comfortable setting some boundaries to honor what makes your comfortable.


Say “No, I do not feel comfortable doing that.” Not only will this send a clear message to your friend that you do not wish to be bossed around, it will also give you a confidence boost for the next time you need to stand up to someone bossy., Even if what your friend is telling you to do isn’t something you disagree with, you should ask if it is in your best interest to do it. A friend might try to boss you into doing something that they feel will have negative consequences. This lets the friend get what they want, while avoiding the risk of consequences.For example, if your friend wants to get out of a class, they might try to boss you into pulling the fire alarm in the building. Getting caught would result in disciplinary actions against you, and it is a bad idea to be bossed into these types of activities.

 If you want to do the medicine ball alphabet workout to strengthen your shoulders, you need to work with a medicine ball that's small enough that you can palm it with one hand.Choose a lighter weight to start with, one you can hold with one hand with your arm extended and comfortably move with full range of motion in your shoulder.;
, To do the one-armed medicine ball alphabet workout, stand in a stable position with feet hip-width or shoulder-width apart. Check your posture and make sure your back and shoulders are neutral, not hunched.Lift the medicine ball with your right hand, and extend your arm out straight in front of you, just slightly to the outside of your body. Your arm should be a straight line from your shoulder with the medicine ball in your hand.
 Move the medicine ball as though you are writing the letters of the alphabet, using slow, controlled movements. It's generally easier to write the letters in cursive so there's a connection between each letter.By doing this exercise with one arm, you strengthen your deltoid and rotator cuff muscles. This can improve your posture and increase the range of motion in your shoulder.
 Once you've gone through the entire alphabet with your right arm, lower your arm and rest for a minute, setting down the medicine ball. Then pick the medicine ball up with your left hand and raise your left arm just as you did your right.Trace the letters of the alphabet with your left arm. This can be tricky if you're right-handed, because you don't have experience making letter shapes with your left hand. The key is to go slowly, and think of reversing the movement you made with your right arm.

 You don’t have to decide on a parenting style on your own. If you are raising children with other adults, talk to them about what they believe is best for the child. You may refer to the parenting styles, or come up with a hybrid style of your own.
 In any household there is a lot of work to be done. With two parents, it is important that there is open communication about whose job it is to meet the various needs of your child. You'll have to agree on a clear division of labor for things to run smoothly. Who will take care of bath time? Who will cook dinner? These are good questions to work through before the stresses of being parents pile up., Come up with a set of practices that you will use to ensure that you see the desired outcome for you and your child. Have a conversation with the parents involved and create a clear guide for how you will handle parenting issues.


Talk about discipline and praise. Figure out when and how you will praise, discipline, and spend time with your child.
Talk about parenting duties. Decide how you will divide child care, finances, and household chores with your spouse or co-parent.
 Check in with your fellow parent (or parents) to see how things are going. Think back to what you wanted for your child when you first put together a parenting plan. Compare your child’s reality with your original expectations. If things are not going as planned, consider adjusting your strategies or changing your parenting style.Ask key questions to see if things are going well. Is your child doing well in school? Are they making good choices? Do they have significant friendships? Are they happy?

, Because you can't spend all your resources. When your troops will get killed and you don't have any resources left and your enemy realizes that, you will lose. Usually you can use 2/3 of your available resources.
 If you have only 1 barrack, the building of troops can take a little bit of time. Build 4 to 6 barracks, then with only one Shift+Click and all barracks selected, you will have 20 or 30 skirmishers that will fight for you. The resources go away fast, but you can pump out troops really fast and it's also useful to build a fast defense, if your enemy is attacking you.
 They are strong and are the key of your army. Build at least 50 of them. They will shoot every enemy who is in their way. To support your musketeers against other infantry, build some cannons. They will shoot all the enemy infantry away and your troops get a better survivability. You can not specialize your troops on one unit. To attack successfully, you will need everything. Some units more than others.
 Make sure you will use them as Outposts. Select the blockhouses and train 100 strelets. They are cheap, and with 5 blockhouses you will have 100 strelets in no time.



musketeers / 5 â€“ 10 cannons / 20 pike men / 20 melee-cavalry
This is a very good little army. If your army needs to be bigger, just double everything.
 Send shipments of Strelets, if you have an overabundance of Strelets. Although they are cheap, it is better to get them for free.
 They were expensive and they are very effective! So watch them all the time. Good players will always try to first kill your cannons with cavalry.
 When your cannons survive, then can make huge damage to the enemy infantry. I always try to kill the enemy cannons first. If you let cannons shoot your troops too long, you will have nothing left, they blow everything away (except cavalry).
 Of course there are other good combinations and you can adjust the units to your play style.

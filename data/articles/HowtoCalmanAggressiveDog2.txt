 Dogs are sensitive to the moods of others, especially when they are in a state of aggression. The more calm you are when other dogs are approaching the less likely your dog will be to exhibit aggressive behavior.Avoid tensing up the leash, forcing your dog to move quickly, or raising your voice if you anticipate a aggressive outburst. Instead, calmly lead your dog away from approaching dogs or if they are already displaying aggressive behavior.Remember, the calmer you are the calmer your dog will be.
 If you see another dog approaching, move to the other side of the road, walk to another side of the park, or take a safe distance and wait for the dog to pass. Creating space between your dog and the other dog will help you avoid any aggressive interaction.Try using a blockade, like a car or tree, when another dog is approaching.
Avoid pulling back on the leash when pulling your dog away from other dogs. Instead, pull your dog to the side and calmly lead them away.
 The more frequently and consistently your dog interacts with other dogs the less likely they are to display aggressive behavior. Scheduling regular play dates with other dogs, walking calmly by other dogs, and have brief encounters with dogs at the dog park with help desensitize your dog.Keep a long distance when first desensitizing your dog to other dogs. Once they seem comfortable continue approaching at a steady rate and stop and wait once their aggression is triggered again.

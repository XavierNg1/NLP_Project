 Stir the mixture until the sugar is fully dissolved.
 A nine or ten-inch baking pan works quite well. It should be shallow enough to help the sherbert freeze evenly, but still deep enough so that the liquid is contained., Cover it with plastic wrap and place it in the freezer.
 Stirring after half an hour will help the sherbert freeze evenly and acquire the right texture.
 After a few hours, the sherbert should be scoopable. Use a spoon or an ice cream scoop to serve it up in small bowls.

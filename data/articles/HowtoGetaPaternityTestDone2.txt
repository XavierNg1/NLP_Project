 Another way to establish paternity is to sign a Declaration of Paternity (sometimes also called an Acknowledgement of Paternity Affidavit).These forms can be filled out and filed at different times depending on where you are in the process of having the child and establishing paternity.These declarations or affidavits are useful when you feel comfortable with who you believe or know the father to be, as the signing of these forms will legally establish parentage.You can either sign this form at the hospital when the child is born, which will result in the declarant's name being placed on the official birth certificate, or you can sign it after the initial birth certificate has already been issued, which will result in the declarant's name being added to the birth certificate., Whether you are going to sign the form at the hospital or afterwards, you will need to access the form online or in person and fill it out. Each state will have their form in a different place, so be sure you do some research to find out where you can access the form.


In California, a sample form can be accessed here. The actual form can be mailed to you if you email askpop@dcss.ca.gov.The form can also be obtained by going to your county's child support agency, registrar of births, family law facilitator, or welfare office.In Ohio, the document will be generated at the hospital at the time of the child's birth or at a local health department or Child Support Enforcement Agency., Once you have filled out your state's designated form, you will need to file it with the correct agency or department.


In California, the completed form must be filed with the California Department of Child Support Services Paternity Opportunity Program.In Ohio, the completed form must be filed with the Office of Vital Statistics.

 The location of kidney stone pain depends on the location of the stone in the urinary tract. The pain can be in your back, in your sides, or around the genital region. Very small kidney stones may not have any symptoms unless the stones are causing a blockage or if there is an infection. Some kidney stones may cause significant symptoms which include:nausea
vomiting
blood in the urine
sweating
fever
cloudy urine

, Your doctor may diagnose your kidney stones based on your symptoms, analysis of the urine, and sometimes using various imaging techniques such as X-rays, CT or MRI scans. In recurring cases of kidney stones, the kidney stone composition may also be determined.


In some cases, you may be asked to bring the stone in for analysis after you pass it. To do this, you will have to urinate through a sieve designed to collect any stones.
 Kidney stones affect about 5% of the population. Older white men are at the highest risk while younger women are also at risk. For women, the risk peaks at around age 50 while for men, the risk begins to rise in their forties and continues up to the age of 70.The rate of kidney stones for young adults has doubled in the last 25 years. The cause of this increase is unclear. It may be due to obesity and weight issues, but may also be associated with the increased intake of phosphate-containing soft drinks and carbonated beverages.
Other risk factors can include a family history of kidney stones and dietary factors., The most common treatment for kidney stones is to drink lots of water and take pain relievers. For some types of stones, particularly uric acid stones, decreasing the acidity of the urine using potassium citrate can also be helpful.


Some prescription drugs can also help to expel kidney stones.
In severe cases, having surgery to remove the stone may be the best option.

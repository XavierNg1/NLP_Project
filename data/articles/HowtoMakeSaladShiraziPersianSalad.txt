, Depending on the thickness of the cucumbers they can either be divided into 6 or 8 slices., If it's a large onion, don't use all of it. You don’t want the onion to overpower the rest of the ingredients., Do the tomatoes last so that you don’t have to wipe your cutting board dry after chopping them.,, Make sure to taste the salad to make sure that there is enough salt., One tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil should do it., Mix well and refrigerate for at least one hour before serving. Salad Shirazi can be served with any meal. Enjoy it!

 Situated north of Los Santos County, Route 68 is one of the many major roads laid out throughout the state of San Andreas. To get there, take the Senora Freeway on the eastern edge of San Andreas and drive north. Make a left turn on the first exit you’ll see after passing Route 13 into East Joshua Road. Drive through East Joshua Road westward passing Bolingbroke Penitentiary and you’ll arrive at Route 68., At the end of Route 68, just after passing by a gas station, you’ll find a bride running down the hill from a church. Stop near her and she’ll approach your car and ask for a hitch. You character will automatically agree, and the bride will get inside your car. She won’t say her name, but she will ask you to take her to home to Vinewood Hills., It’s a short street in the Vinewood Hills area. Taking the same road where you found the bride, drive all the way down south towards Vinewood Hills. Count five corners and make a left turn on the fifth one to get to Kimble Hill Drive. She’ll then ask you to stop once you get there, and she’ll step out of your car.

During the drive, the groom will appear and chase you down. To get rid of him, stop your car and step out. The groom will step out of his vehicle as well. Hit the groom with any melee weapon you have, like a bat or your bare fist, to knock him out and stop chasing you. Don’t kill the groom though because this will scare the bride and she will run away. There’s no time limit for driving the bride as well and you’ll get additional 5 points for your driving skill.

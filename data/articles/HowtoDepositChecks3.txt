 If you're a member of a local or federal credit union, you can deposit checks not only at any branch of your own union, but also at any branch of any credit union.
 Get in line with your valid, endorsed check and tell the bank teller you'd like to deposit your check, but you're a member of another credit union. You'll need to provide the teller with your check, a valid photo ID, your account number, the name of your branch, and possibly the address of the main branch of your credit union.


There are hundreds of credit unions, and some have very similar names: "Teachers Credit Union" and "Teachers Federal Credit Union" are completely different, for example. The teller is probably unfamiliar with your specific credit union, so make sure to provide them with address when they're searching the database for yours.
 This is also a good opportunity to withdraw cash without paying the fee credit union customers normally pay at ATMs.

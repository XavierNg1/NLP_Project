 A dogs digestive system is different from the human one and the balance of ingredients in homemade dog food needs to be tailored to the dogs special needs. When you cook for your dog, keep the following in mind:


Dogs are carnivores, so at least half of a dog's diet should be composed of protein, which provides dogs with the nutrients and minerals they need to be strong and healthy.Chicken, turkey, beef, lamb, and fish are all acceptable sources of protein for a dog. Dogs can also be fed eggs and vegetables that contain protein.
Organ meat, such as liver and kidney, should only be given to your dog a few times a week.Dogs may also eat grains, root and green vegetables, as long as they are thoroughly cooked.Feeding dogs a vegetarian or vegan diet can hurt their digestive system, since it's tough for dogs to break down large amounts of vegetables.
Supplement your dog's homemade meals with vitamins made for dogs, to make sure they get everything they need. Talk with your vet about supplements you can buy. Be especially careful to make sure your dog has enough calcium, or she may suffer bone injuries as she grows and ages. ;
, Some say that raw meat is better for dogs, since they aren't susceptible to the organisms that make humans sick from eating raw steak or chicken.Other sources claim that cooked meat is a safer choice.A raw meat diet often also include bones, which provide dogs with necessary calcium and other nutrients.Conduct research to decide what type of meat you want to feed your dog. Ask your vet if you want more information on the subject.

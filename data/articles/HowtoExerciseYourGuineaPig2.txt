 Make sure that the space is guinea pig-proof! That means no spare cords (to avoid electrocution), other pets, or anything that is potentially dangerous to a guinea pig. Try to close off spaces such as under a dresser, couch, or bed, as this can tempt your guinea pigs to squeeze under there, and it can be very difficult to lure them out., If you don't want your piggies to do their business on the carpet or tile, place some towels (or an old blanket) on the ground. You may even want to put them in a large puppy playpen, with towels underneath., Select a few of your guinea pigâ€™s favorite hidey houses, balls, or other toys are position them in your play area. These will signal to your piggy that it is time to play., It is also a good idea to put out some vegetable for your guinea pig to nibble on as he plays. This will give him a small energy boost, as well just make this time a little more fun. Try giving him broccoli, carrots, or celery., Once the area is safe, the towels are down, the toys are positioned, and the veggies are out, there is nothing left to do but let your piggy play!

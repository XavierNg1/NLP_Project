 Who is the likely clientele for your motel? A business traveler is going to have different needs than a family on vacation. For instance, business travelers might expect coffee machines in their room, while families might appreciated motel rooms that can be connected with a side door.Before you can design a motel room, you need to evaluate the needs of the guests that you expect to stay in your motel.In addition, watch the competition to pick up on trends and new ideas in the motel room design world.;
, How much will you spend per room? The size of the room generally doesn’t matter when deciding how to design the room. You can spend a lot or a little on a motel room of a given size.Once you know your budget, you’ll be able to plan the room to your liking.
 Building and safety codes determine things like how many fire alarms, exits, fire extinguishers, windows, and so on a room needs. They are usually issued by a state authority such as the department of public health, and may be amended by local authorities with additional provisions. Stay conscious of required elements when designing your motel room.
 Hire “guests” to try the room out and solicit feedback about their experience to find out what worked and what didn’t.


Have room testers fill out a questionnaire inquiring about every aspect of the room: lighting, comfort, spaciousness, flooring, cover the wall, bathroom, and so on.
If you are the proprietor of a smaller motel, you can do similar test runs by designing (or redesigning) only a single hotel room of a given style and renting it out to guests. Administer a questionnaire about their experiences and, if possible, talk to them about their experience in the room to figure out how you can improve the room’s design.

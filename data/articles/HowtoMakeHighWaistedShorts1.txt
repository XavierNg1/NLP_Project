 If you want to make high waisted shorts, then you have to find a pair of jeans with the right waist height.This could be an old pair of jeans in the back of your closet, a pair of jeans given to you by a friend, or one that you snagged at Goodwill. It doesn't matter where the jeans came from as long as you don't mind cutting them up.;
, Don't just start cutting up your old pants -- try them on to make sure you like their high waisted look. They should feel comfortable and the waist should be the right height. If the pants are too baggy, they'll fall down below your waist and you won't be able to make high waisted shorts from them.

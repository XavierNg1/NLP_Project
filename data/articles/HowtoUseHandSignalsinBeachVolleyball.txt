 You should be positioned in front of your partner at the net, blocking. These signals help you communicate who they should serve to, when and where to block, and more. You can even come up with your own signals; just make sure that your partner clearly understands what it means.
 All signals should be made behind your back so that your opponents don't know what you are going to do. Most people put the signal behind their butt., Make a fist with your pinky finger sticking out on both hands.

Whichever side your hand is on coordinates with the player on that side. Shake or wave the hand on the side that coordinates with the person you want your partner to serve to.
 To do this, make a fist with both hands., To do this, point your index finger with both hands or' use one hand and point your index and pinky fingers (like the "rock on" symbol. #*Typically this means that you will peel to the side coordinating with the side your partner serves to on the other side of the net. Your partner will then cover the other side., The same goes for double cross as double line except, instead of pointing your index finger, you will extend your index and middle finger like the "peace out" gesture.

You cannot do this on one hand.
 Once again, coordinate with the appropriate side. On one hand, point your index finger and on the other, point the middle and index fingers.

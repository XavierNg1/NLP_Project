 Build up a supply for craft use. If you can't wait that long, foil wrappers can be purchased from stores that stock craft and candy-making supplies.;
, Cut the colored foil into small rectangles.


If you're using used wrappers, smooth out all wrinkles before using. Children can be shown how to do this and they'll find it a lot fun to do.
 If you're using a secondhand container, give it a good scrub and let it dry before use. If it's a new one, remove any stickers that might be on it from the retailer.
 Allow this dry before adding the wrappers.
 There are a few options in terms of colors––multi-colored, two or three colors, even just a single color, etc. The color choice will depend on what you have but it is a lot of fun to use many colors. However, two tone can also look really effective, especially if it's for a seasonal decoration, such as red and green for Christmas, orange and brown for Halloween, two pastel colors for Easter, etc.


For occasions such as Diwali, New Year (any culture) and birthdays, use as many colors as possible to make it appear festive.
 Attach it to the flowerpot by pressing into place. It's best to work from bottom to top; that way you can fix up any of the more obvious gaps with neat overlaps into the top of the container.


When adding each piece of foil, smooth out the foil from its center to its edges; this will remove air bubbles and ensure that it sticks on neatly.
 Leave the base and inside of the container free of wrappers.
 When dry, paint a coat of glue over the top of the whole creation. This will set it in place and protects it from scratches, scrapes and water when using the flowerpot. Allow to dry fully.
 Add soil and a plant. Or add a dried flower arrangement. In fact, you can put anything you want inside the flowerpot. Then put it on display where it can be admired.

 Think draping and flowing, with a sharp cinch at the waist. However, depending on your body type, make sure the clothes still show off your figure.;
, Aurora loves flowers. When looking for clothes, find things with subtle floral accents.
 Never show too much skin. This style is classy. Things that are too short or too low-cut are not ideal for this look. Try A-line skirts that cinch in at the waist or colorful, scoop-neck sweaters that fit your body nicely.
 When accessorizing, think about keeping it simple. You never see Aurora piled on with tons of bracelets and necklaces. Keep it down to one or two pieces. Try simple belts and headbands to complete your look.
 When it's time to dress up, choose a long dress or gown. Try going for long sleeves, as Aurora would. If you aren't comfortable with long sleeves, at least have a cap sleeve.
 Don't be afraid of bright color. Find the color that works for you, and choose a nice bold shade of it. Use your color as much as you can without being too eye-catching (in a bad way).

The handle that is used to turn the can is comprised of an axle and a wheel. Lastly, the circular wheel that cuts into a can is called a wedge.The tin can was invented in the early 1800s by an Englishman. It required some skill to open it, and people usually used rocks, chisels or knives to work their way into it. Finally, the can opener was invented in 1858, and the task became a lot easier.;

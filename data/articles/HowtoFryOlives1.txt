 Pour the olives into a strainer or colander to drain the liquid. Pat them dry with a paper towel if they were jarred in anything other than oil.If your olives are not pitted, use a cherry or olive pitter to remove the pits.
You can use unstuffed olives or, for extra flavor, purchase garlic-stuffed olives.;
, Mix the flour, garlic powder, and chili powder together in one dish. Keep the eggs in a separate dish. Combine the breadcrumbs with the ground black pepper in a third dish., While you dredge the olives, cover the bottom of a saucepan with 2 inches (5 cm) of oil and heat it to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) over medium-high heat. Roll the olives in the flour mixture first, in the egg second, and in the breadcrumbs last. Set the olives on a plate and give the coating a minute or two to dry before frying.Use a kitchen thermometer designed for frying that attaches to the side of the pan.
 Carefully use a slotted spoon to place half of the olives into the hot oil. Don’t drop them in, as this will splatter hot oil. Fry the olives until the coating is golden brown, or about 30 seconds to a minute.Increase the heat as necessary to keep the oil’s temperature constant. It might cool slightly when you add the olives.
 Remove the golden brown olives from the oil and drain them on a cooling rack or plate covered with paper towels. Fry and drain the second batch. Arrange the olives onto a platter and serve them hot.Try serving the olives with cubed Manchego cheese and thin slices of serrano ham. Provide your guests with tongs or toothpicks to serve themselves the hors d’oeuvres.

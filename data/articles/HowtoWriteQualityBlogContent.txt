 Is it a blog about everyday life? Game reviews? Product reviews?;
, Is your blog known for the effects that are used during the video or how unique your rant on a product is because of how crappy it is? How can it be different?

, The best idea is to do it daily if not once a week. Bloggers who use Youtube tend to update daily. However, if you're writing it then do it weekly to keep people coming back.
 Each blogger has a unique style which makes them different from the rest. Try to keep that same attitude as it'll help keep your audience and add more people as your following expands.
 Simple as that. Selling out would mean changing who you are. Sponsorships are nice but try to keep the same attitude throughout as stated in 4 as you risk losing a good amount of your audience when they read your blog/view it.

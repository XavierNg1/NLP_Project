 Using a comb or pick, separate your hair into three layers going from the top of your head down to the neck. Secure each section to your head with clips in order to keep it in place.
 Release the lower section of hair and grab a roughly two-inch chunk with your fingers.
 Using a crimping iron, crimp as close to the scalp as you can get. Do one crimp, move the iron forward just a bit, and then crimp again.









You can spray each crimped section with hairspray as you go, if you want to. This is an especially good idea if your hair normally can't hold a shape.
 Repeat sectioning and crimping until the layer is finished. When the layer is done, move on to the next layer up.
 With the lower two layers done, release the top layer. This layer will not be crimped, but will instead hide the crimping of the lower layers.
 Gently prod your fingers through your hair, starting low and moving in a short upward motion. This will break up the crimps and give the hair more natural flow.
 With your hair volumized, you can proceed to style as normal. Avoid using too much combing or brushing, however, as this will cause volume loss.

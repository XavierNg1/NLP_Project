 Your poor toy may be covered with gross lint from over-playing with it. When you vacuum your stuffed animal, it removes their dust and dirt. It's like an air shower!

If the animal is way too dirty for vacuuming, give it toy a bath by putting it in the washing machine, or you can hand wash it yourself. Just be sure to read the washing instructions for your toy.
 Nobody wants a naked toy! The best store to buy clothes will be toy stores or places that let you make a bear/stuffed toy.
 If they have a cut or tear, stitch them up. If you don't know how, ask around your family and friends. It's kind of like going to the doctor's for stuffed animals.

 Is it played in water? On a field? Indoors or outdoors? Is it about accuracy or about speed? Is it an individual sport or a team sport? All these things are key when it comes to making your sport.;
, It shouldn't be complicated like "insert ridiculous name here Romp," but it shouldn't be lame, either, like "Throwball."

, If it doesn't really matter where it's played, then make sketches of the things that are needed, such as in soccer, all you need are two goals.
 Be sure all the players have specific jobs, and that each one contributes to the game. Don't make pointless rules, like 'No throwing the ball at another player's face.' Make it more broad, such as 'No physical violence,' and include that under the title rule.
 Sports involving balls must have a specific design for the ball. Some sports need specific uniforms. Some have a specific shape of a racket. Be creative in thinking these up!

,,(If you attend a public school, e-mail other schools to see if they would be interested in including it in extra-curricular activities.)

, You never know if there is a sport in another country just like the one you're creating. Make sure its original! If you see something similar out there, add a few tweaks to your own sport to make it different. It can be similar, but don't make it too much so.

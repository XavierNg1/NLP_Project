Draw a diagram if you think it may be helpful during reassembly.
Note that different devices will have different specific assemblies.;
, Hold the tank itself under a faucet running warm water for 20 seconds or so. Adjust the water to be as warm as possible without being too hot to touch. This will help rinse away residual e-juice.Use a faucet that provides a moderately powerful stream.
If you clean your tank regularly and prevent e-juice from forming deposits within the tank, warm water will usually be enough to clean your tank.

Twist the material and pull it back and forth through the tank to wipe residual water away., Hold the pieces you've removed from the vape tank in a bowl of warm water. This will help you keep track of each piece, and a short soak will assist in cleaning.Use a small microfiber cloth or clean toothbrush to wash each part of your tank assembly, especially those that have fine features such as threading.

For this reason, allow everything to dry for at least ten minutes before reassembling and refilling.Simply allow the tank and other pieces to air dry. Do not dry your tank with heat or direct sunlight, as these risk weakening or damaging some pieces.

 Cleaner stones mean less upkeep during the tumbling process.;
, Stones should be of roughly the same material hardness, and, for optimal results, the same basic size (though for convenience, multiple sizes can be tumbled at once).
 Experts recommend filling the tumbler up to about 50% to 60% of volume for most loads. Start with a coarser grit, and progress to a finer grit as necessary.
 Wait several minutes. Listen to the tumbler to check for any aggressive sounds that would indicate malfunction. A steady, shifting noise means that the tumbler is working properly.
 Some experts recommend several days, but depending on the rock type, a one-day cycle may be sufficient. Check stones after one day to see if they need more tumbling.
 Every 24 hours, check the stones, and also filter out any built up material that has accumulated. Pros call this mix “slurry.” It is composed of sloughed off bits from rocks. For finer tumbling, replace the grit after several days with a finer variety up to several hundred mesh.

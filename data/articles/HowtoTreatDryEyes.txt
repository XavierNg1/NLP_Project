A problem with any part of a tear can cause problems for your entire eye. The cause can be virtually anything, but you may try a variety of treatments.;
, Artificial tear drops are designed to lubricate dry eyes and keep them moist on the outer surface. Artificial teardrops do not necessarily treat the underlying cause of your dry eyes. Instead, they provide relief from the symptoms.Some contain preservatives that can irritate your eyes if you use them more than four times per day. If you need to use artificial tears more than four times per day, look for preservative-free artificial tears or speak with a doctor.Trial and error is usually the only way to find the best brand of artificial tears for your particular dry eyes. In some cases, a combination of a few brands may be even be necessary. They are available over the counter and are available in a wide assortment of brands.

 If you've tried eye drops and prescription drops, but still have severe dry eyes, see your eye doctor. Once the doctor has determined the cause of your dry eyes, you'll have other treatment options available to you.


If you're experiencing pain, like itching, burning, or blurred vision, see your eye doctor., Your doctor may prescribe an eye ointment. Unlike artificial tears which treat symptoms of dry eyes, ointments are medicated to treat the cause of your dry eyes.


Eye ointments can also comfort because of their lubricating effect. They're useful during extended periods when artificial tears can't be applied. (While sleeping, for example.)

, You may need a more permanent or aggressive treatment. Your doctor may suggest inserting plugs into your tear ducts. These block tear drainage so your eyes remain lubricated.These plugs conserve your tears, as well as any artificial tears you use., If you've had your tear ducts plugged, but are still dealing with aggressive dry eyes, your doctor may suggest cauterizing the tear ducts. Once your doctor approves this surgery, an eye care professional will exam you and perform the surgery.

 Use artificial tears as eye drops to keep your eyes lubricated and moisturized. You can also use ointments which last longer than eye drops. However, they can be messy because of their viscous nature and can lead to blurred vision. You might only want to use them while you sleep.


Use eye drops before, rather than after, performing visually demanding activities to prevent dry eyes. Try to blink often. This will help spread the tears or drops evenly.
 Dry eyes can come from too much salt in the diet or lack of vitamins. You can test this for yourself, especially when getting up at night to use the bathroom. If your eyes are dry, drink around 12 ounces of water. See if your eyes get immediate relief. If they do, then reduce the salt in your diet and stay hydrated.

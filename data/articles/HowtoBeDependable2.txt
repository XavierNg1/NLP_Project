 Dependable means capable of being depended on; worthy of trust, example: "A dependable employee does good work and is good at being on time..." Synonyms for dependable include steadfast, trustworthy, reliable, consistent, and stable., Despite dependable being relatively easy to define, many people often confuse it with being a pushover, a doormat or a "yes" man. Being dependable does not equate to these labels. Dependable people follow through on their word and produce consistent results time and time again. It is not necessarily true that they allow others to walk all over them or are afraid to speak up for themselves., Think about how key people in your life have spoken about you - parents, teachers, employers, friends, etc. Do these people mention your punctuality? Do they rave about how you always complete tasks that are assigned to you? Or, do they complain that you are frequently late? Do they describe you as unreliable?


If you have difficulty determining how those closest to you rate you on the dependability scale, ask them. Reach out to a boss, teacher, or parent and ask the person if he/she thinks you are dependable. If they answer in the negative, ask the person for advice on how you might better yourself in this area.

 You may have your kids paint at the table, on a hardwood floor, or on the wall. Regardless of the area you choose, spreading newspaper beneath the area protects your surfaces from accidental paint splatters.;
, Tempera paint works well for most applications, as does any paint marked “kid proof,” “children’s art paint,” or “washable.”

, When working with paint and kids, you can almost be certain that someone will get paint on themselves. Even when using paints that wash out with water, you may still run into a few stains.
 Seasonal sponges are especially common around various holidays, but you may be able to find more standard shapes throughout the year.
 Buy craft, kitchen, or bath sponges. You may also use packing foam, in a pinch. Draw out your desired shapes and cut them out using a sharp utility knife or scissors.


Sponges that are about 1/2-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick may be the easiest to cut, and they may also be the easiest for tiny hands to pinch and grip. Larger sponges can also work, however, but you may need to create a handle for kids to use them.
 Toddlers can find enjoyment out of the simple shapes alone. Other children can combine simple shapes into slightly more complex pictures, like flowers or snowmen.
 Butterflies, stars, hearts, and flowers are among the many possibilities. If you do not feel comfortable drawing these shapes from scratch, you can trace them onto the sponges using stencils or cookie cutters.
 Cut out letters of the alphabet or numbers to help young children learn the alphabet, count to ten, practice their spelling, or perform basic addition and subtraction problems.

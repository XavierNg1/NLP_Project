 Look online or contact local, county, state, and federal offices to find out what is allowed and what isn’t. Some areas regulate land clearing extensively and require several different kinds of permits, and others are much more relaxed. Be sure that you’re aware of the rules and plan to follow them., Before you bring in a bulldozer, hire a professional to cut down any large trees that are in good shape. These trees can be sold for lumber.


Rocks, gravel, and plants on the land can also have monetary value.
 The bulldozer can then push away debris from the harvesting, and the bulldozer will push over stumps and fairly small trees and bushes.


Bulldozing is a cheaper method of clearing land. However, the topsoil of your land will be damaged during the process. Topsoil is lost when it attaches itself to the roots of the stumps that are pushed away.
The debris pushed away by the bulldozer has to go somewhere. If you choose the bulldozing method, you will have huge piles of debris. This can be an eyesore that is hard to get rid of. Condense your wood debris by using a wood chipping machine. You can try burning the debris, but it will first have to dry for several months and may not burn well because of all of the dirt mixed in. Also consider burying the pile of debris. This will require having a place to bury it and possibly also a permit.

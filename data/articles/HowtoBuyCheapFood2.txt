 Search through junk mail, magazine advertisements, and the Internet for useful coupons. Subscribe to free online coupon services or coupon books that come in the mail. These steps may require more effort than you are used to, but can go a long way towards making your food cheaper.
 The downside of coupons is that many people can get carried away very easily. Only buy food that you know you will enjoy and consume. Otherwise, you will end up wasting your money.
 Every grocery store has its own weekly specials. Often, these specials are advertised in your junk mail or in pamphlets lying around inside the store. Flip through these pamphlets and shop for foods when they come on sale.
 Many large grocery chains allow their patrons to apply for free shopper cards. These cards usually take off additional money on many products, making these foods even cheaper.

 The apothem is a line from the center of a pentagon, that hits a side at a right angle. If you are given its length, you can use this easy formula


Area of a regular pentagon = pa/2, where p = the perimeter and a = the apothem.If you don't know the perimeter, calculate it from the side length: p = 5s, where s is the side length.
 If you only know the side length, use the following formula:Area of a regular pentagon = (5s2) / (4tan(36º)), where s = side length.
tan(36º) = √(5-2√5).So if your calculator doesn't have a "tan" function, use the formula Area = (5s2) / (4√(5-2√5)).
 You can even find the area if you only know the radius. Use this formula:Area of a regular pentagon = (5/2)r2sin(72º), where r is the radius.

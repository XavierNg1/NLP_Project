 Pour your vegetable stock into a deep pot and turn the stovetop to high. Once your stock starts boiling, reduce the temperature to medium to bring your stock to a simmer.You can also use chicken stock.
 Pour a teaspoon of oil in another pan and turn your stovetop to high until it starts to smoke slightly. Reduce the heat to medium and start cooking your chopped onions. Stir the pan until the onions become translucent., Add your chopped sorrel to the stock along with your cooked onions. Mix the sorrel and the onions into the stock for five minutes, uncovered.You can add more sorrel to your stock if you want your soup to taste stronger.
 Combine the 1/2 (118.29 ml) cup cream with the two egg yolks and mix them together until everything is well incorporated. You must do this separately before you add it to your broth., Use a ladle to trickle the cream and egg mixture into your broth. Continue to ladle the mixture into your soup until you've transferred it all.
 Do not cook the broth on high heat while you add your eggs or they will become scrambled. Stir the soup as it heats up. Allow the soup to continue cooking for five more minutes before serving it.This sorrel soup can also be enjoyed with a dollop of sour cream.

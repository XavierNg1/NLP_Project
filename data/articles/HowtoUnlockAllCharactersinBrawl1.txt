 As you play through the Subspace story, new characters will join your team. This is a straightforward way to unlock most (but not all) characters.


Subspace Emissary automatically unlocks these characters in this order: Marth, Falco, Captain Falcon, Lucario, Snake, Mr. Game & Watch, R.O.B., Luigi, Ness, and Sonic.;
, This is the one Subspace unlock that requires you to do something special to get the character. On the 30th stage, "Subspace (Part II)," collect both the Link and Zelda trophies to unlock Ganondorf. Look for the trophies at these locations:Zelda's trophy is near the beginning of the stage, to the right of a column of green quark mines.
To get Link's trophy, go through the first door, then break the bomb block directly beneath you. Link is on the next platform below.
 You can also unlock characters by playing Brawl mode. To check your total number of Brawl matches, go the main menu, select Data → Records. Scroll to the last page for Brawl Records, then check the number after "Offline Vs. Matches Played" (online matches do not count).Raise this number to these milestones to unlock these characters:5 – Ness
10 – Marth
22 – Luigi
50 – Falco
70 – Captain Falcon
100 – Lucario
130 – Snake (or just 15 matches on Shadow Moses Island)
160 – R.O.B.
200 – Ganondorf
250 – Mr. Game & Watch
300 – Sonic

350 – Jigglypuff (These last three cannot be unlocked in Subspace.)
400 – Toon Link
450 – Wolf

, If you're playing Versus matches just to unlock characters, go to Special Brawl and turn on Stamina and Flower. Set a computer opponent's stamina to 1 and the flower should defeat it immediately when you start the game.

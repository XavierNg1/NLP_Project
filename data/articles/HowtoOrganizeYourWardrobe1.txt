 Instead of haphazardly hanging your clothing wherever you can, organize your closet into sections. Hang a certain type of clothing in each section.You will be able to locate the clothing you need much more quickly and your closet will look much neater. Sections can include:


Shirts
Skirts
Pants
Jackets
Work clothing
Special clothing, such as formal wear, suits, or costumes;
, Now that your clothing has been separated into neat categories, rearrange the items in each one so that they look tidy. There are several ways you can organize the sections in your closet. For example:


Within each section, organize the clothing by color.
Arrange shirts by sleeve length.
Separate your dresses by their length, placing the shortest in the front and the longest in the back.
 If you have limited wardrobe space, use the areas above and below the clothing rack to store folded items, shoes, jewelry, and lingerie.If necessary, use organizational tools such as dividers or small boxes to help you organize the vertical space. For example:


Store large purses on a shelf above the clothing rack.
Stack two metal shoe racks under the clothing rack to store twice the number of shoes.
Stack shoe boxes on a shelf above the clothing rack.
 There are many department stores and online shops that sell containers, hooks, racks, and dividers. These items can be used to attractively display your clothing and accessories while making them easy to access. For example:


Use small, clear containers to store and stack shoes. Since you can see through the containers, you wonâ€™t forget about the shoes you store.Use shelf dividers above your clothing rack. These dividers can separate folded scarves, purses, or small handbags.Purchase small adhesive hooks and attach them to your closet wall or door. Use these hooks to store scarves, belts, or jewelry.

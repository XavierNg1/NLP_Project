 Make sure you have enough time for a nice, long, relaxing bath. About twenty minutes should do. Bubble bars are luxurious, and not worth a quick, five minute bath. Save them for when you have time to take a longer bath and relax.;
, By cutting your bar into smaller pieces, you'll be extending the life of one bar, and saving money. You can store the extra bars in a plastic bag or box. Make sure that the bag or box seals up tightly.


Keep the labels, and stick them onto the bag or box. This way, you'll have the name/scent, and use-by date.Be careful not to get water into the bag or box. The extra bars must be kept dry until you are ready to use them., Use a temperature that is most comfortable for you. Have your bubble bar ready.
 The tub will begin to fill with thick, fluffy bubbles.


Some people prefer to put the crumbled bar into a strainer first, so that they don't drop any pieces into the water.
The stronger the water flow, the more bubbles you'll get.Some bubble bars are colored, but you may not see the color at first. The color will become deeper the longer you hold the bar under the water., This will help create more bubbles. If there are not enough bubbles to your liking, add a little bit more of the bubble bar.
 Light some candles, turn on some music, or read a book. Baths are supposed to take a little longer than showers so that the body and mind can relax.


Expect the bubbles to last about 20 minutes.

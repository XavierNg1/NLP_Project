 Make two marks on this line, one 1/4" (6.3 mm) down from the top of the book, the other 1/4" (6.3 mm) up from the bottom. Now, divide the distance between these marks into thirds and mark the two middle points.;
, Protect your work surface with a piece of scrap wood or an old phone book as you punch a hole at each of the marked points using the awl or wire brads. Making these holes should not damage the text in the book. Most paperback books have an inner margin of 1/2" (1.2 cm) to 3/4" (1.9 cm), leaving plenty of room for rebinding.
 Open the book a few pages and, next to the lower middle hole, push the needle through about twenty pages. Pull the thread through until the knot is snug against the pages. Go back out to the front cover by pushing the needle up through the awl hole. This step anchors the thread.
 Pull the thread tight each time you go through a hole.
 Then go down through the other middle hole. Pull the thread tight after going through each hole. Around the back again, then up through the top hole. Around the back; then go around the top of the spine and up through the top hole again. Keep going, down through one middle hole, back up through the next, and down through the bottom hole. Keep the thread tight. Around the back again; then go around the bottom of the spine and back through the bottom hole. Go up through the starting hole again.
 Tie off the thread so the binding won't come loose. Do this by slipping the needle under two of the top threads coming out of starting hole and back through the loop to form a tight knot.

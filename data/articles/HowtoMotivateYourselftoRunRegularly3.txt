 Also do strength training.
 Don't ever miss to do stretching for 15 minutes after run.
 This is essential for building up your leg and mid section muscles. Something like the following is useful to try:


One leg squat
One leg balance
Stretching
Glutes building exercise
Focus on the calves and quads
Core exercise.
 And reward yourself for reaching milestones. Strength training added in will make your running experience better day by day.

 A toggle anchor with a hook consists of a bolt threaded through the center of two spring-loaded wings; a hook is attached to the end of the bolt instead of a standard bolt head.


Never use a plastic anchor to hang something from a ceiling. Plastic anchors are meant to be used for lighter loads against a vertical wall. Measure the thickness of the drywall and the weight of the item you want to hang; then consult a chart of load capacities to determine what size toggle bolt you should be using. ,


A toggle bolt cannot be screwed into a wooden joist, so make sure you're drilling into a hollow area.
If you're hanging a lamp, make sure your hole is close to a power outlet that you easily can plug it into.
 The packaging on your toggle bolt should specify how big the hole should be - usually around half an inch.


If the packaging doesn't indicate the size, measure the base of the toggle when it's closed to determine how big of a hole to drill.
If you're using an especially large toggle bolt, use a paddle bit to drill the hole. A paddle bit is designed to drill larger holes.
 When they reach the hollow space, the wings will open. Tightening the bolt will screw the wings down until they are secure against the inner surface of the ceiling.

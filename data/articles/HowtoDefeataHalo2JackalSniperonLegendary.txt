 Ideally, you should have a sniper rifle or a beam rifle, because snipers engage out of range of most other weapons. If you can't obtain one, use a Battle Rifle or a Covenant Carbine.;
, Find something to hide behind, and hide behind it! Ideally, it will protect you from multiple angles, and it will give you multiple places to pop out.
 Usually you will see the beam of pink light they fire. If you are moving erratically, the beam is less likely to hit you. When you see the beam, look to the source. Usually the sniper will be in plain sight.
 Popping out in the same place will work on infantry, but snipers will be able to take you out very quickly. Do not expose yourself when you change position.
 Do not scope at medium range; use the 5x scope at long range.
, Zoom once, aim for the sniper's head, and fire.
 A vapor trail or a pink beam of light will give you away to almost anything.
 Jackals usually appear in groups, so be ready for others.

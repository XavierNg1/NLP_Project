 Find a friend who is also interested in learning RP English and practice with him or her. In addition to engaging in conversation, you and your partner can spend time critiquing each otherâ€™s accents. An extra pair of ears will help you recognize where your accent needs work and provide encouragement as your RP English improves., Your local community organization or university may offer conversation groups for English language learners. There are few substitutes for actually using language skills. Regular conversation with a variety of speakers will accustom you to hearing RP English spoken in different voices. Interacting with others keeps you on your toes and helps you apply your new accent in real-world situations.
 Many online English language-learning resources offer opportunities to interact with RP English speakers. Some of these resources are free, while others require a subscription. Look for sites such as English Central, which allows you to upload videos of yourself speaking and then receive pronunciation feedback, or RhinoSpike, which allows you to request recordings by native speakers of texts you submit to the site.

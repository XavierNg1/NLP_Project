 Many organizations are anxious for baby donations of more than just clothes. If this is the case with your charity, check on their needs and follow the steps outlined above for other baby items.
 Check with the Consumer Product Safety Commission5 to make sure your donated items are in line with current safety regulations and that they don’t post health and safety concerns to children.
 Simply search the internet for the name of the product and the word “recall”.
 Make sure that all of the pieces are intact and don’t pose a choking hazard.


Store clothes in bags or boxes that can be sealed, so there isn’t a risk of dirt or animals getting into the donations.

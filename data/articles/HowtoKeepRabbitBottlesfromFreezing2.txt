 Rabbits can easily remain comfortable and healthy in freezing temperatures. However, if they get water in their fur, this can seriously compromise their ability to stay warm. You donâ€™t need to bring them inside during the winter, but you should give them some protection from the elements.


Bedding is a major factor here, because rabbits will hide in the bedding to stay warm. Keep plenty of wood shavings and straw in the cage., A basic shed or barn will work. The location does not need to be warm. It should, however, shelter the rabbit from wind and moisture. http://riseandshinerabbitry.com/2012/02/20/winter-care-for-rabbits/</ref>

, Take a sheet of heavy plastic and wrap it around all sides of the cage. Staple it to the wooden pieces of the cage. Leave some small gaps on the top and the bottom of the plastic, however. The rabbits will need fresh air in the cage to stay comfortable.

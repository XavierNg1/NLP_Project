 If you're currently a paralegal, but you aspire to be a lawyer one day, then dress like a lawyer. If you're a worker who has ambitions of moving into management, then dress like a manager. You might be surprised by how seriously people take you by the clothes you wear and your overall appearance.;
, Even expensive, well-made clothes won’t do you much good if they’re soiled or frayed at the edges.
 Colors send subliminal messages to those around you, and you want to send the right messages. It’s best to avoid loud colors that are a distraction. You're usually safe with navy, grey, black or red.
 Work isn’t the place to show off your hoop earrings or that jangly new bracelet your husband or boyfriend gave you for Christmas.
 Leave the sheer dresses, see-through mesh, leather miniskirts, tube tops, etc. at home. This is true even at workplaces that allow casual dress. Your husband or boyfriend may love the sexy you, but it’s a look that will only get you into the wrong kind of trouble at work.

 Resizing silver jewelry is much more difficult and time consuming than resizing gold. When melting down the silver to resize it, it gets very dirty through oxidization. A jeweler will be able to make sure the piece returns to its previous shiny state after resizing.Keep in mind that if you have a silver ring with a stone in it, some jewelers may tell you it can’t be resized without taking the whole ring apart. Silver conducts heat through the entire ring, making it difficult to resize when there is a stone setting on the piece.
 Even though the silver itself is less valuable per ounce compared to gold, it is time consuming to repair. A jeweler might price the work at a high rate simply because of how long it is going to take them to repair the piece and then polish it back to its normal coloring., Laser welding is the safest way to resize and work on silver, as it won’t harm the metal the way traditional torch welding will. Laser welding will allow a jeweler to resize a silver ring with a stone on it, for example, when the same couldn’t be done with traditional torch welding.A laser welding machine can cost upwards of $20,000, so smaller, independent jewelers might be less likely to own or have access to one.

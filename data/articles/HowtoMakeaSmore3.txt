 Set one of the halves on a microwave-safe dish, and set the other half aside.


Consider placing a paper towel on the plate beneath the graham cracker. It will absorb any moisture that forms and prevent your graham cracker from becoming soggy.
 Set it flat-side down, so that it does not roll off the graham cracker.
 After about 10 to 12 seconds, the marshmallow will begin to poof up.The marshmallow will be soft and gooey inside, but it will not be toasted or golden-brown.


Be sure to watch the marshmallow closelyâ€”it can get hard in a short amount of time. You may need to take the marshmallow out of your microwave in less than 10 seconds.
 Once the marshmallow is gooey and soft, take the plate out of the microwave; use a potholder if necessary. Place a piece of chocolate on top of the marshmallow. The piece of chocolate should be roughly the same size as the graham cracker.
 Press the remaining graham cracker half on top of the chocolate. Wait a few seconds for the chocolate to melt, then serve.

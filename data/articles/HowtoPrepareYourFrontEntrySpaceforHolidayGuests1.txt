 Before guests even enter your home, you can set the scene for a fun and festive holiday gathering by hanging a tasteful wreath. You can purchase a wreath from home decoration stores (such as Target, L.L.Bean, or Michael’s). Or you can make one yourself. Use colors that compliment the color of your door, and opt for simple elegance, not busy opulence.Look for a wreath in a solid color (such as classic green, silver, or red) with simple embellishments (such as berries, bells, or a single bow).
Too many colors or too much flare can make your wreath seem over the top.;
, Consider the look of your entryway floor. Putting down a rug can be both a nice-looking and practical choice. It gives your guests someplace to remove snow-covered boots, but it can also add color and style to your entryway.Choose bold colors and patterns that are less likely to show dirt.
Look for rugs at stores such as Target, Kohl’s, or Bed Bath and Beyond.
 Think about the lighting in your entryway. You want to create a warm, flattering glow while providing enough light to enter safely. Consider using two light sources to create this balance. Place a medium-wattage bulb in an available overhead light fixture, then add a standing lamp with softer bulb., Adding a few holiday decorations to your entryway can set a warm and festive tone. A great choice is a holiday plant (such as a poinsettia, a small tree, or any plant spruced up with holiday lights). Another good option is to trim the space with garland. Finally, if you have a shelf in your entryway, consider placing a small holiday accessory there (such as a a candle or ceramic snowman). Depending on the size of your entryway, you should probably choose just 2 out of these 3 options so it doesn't seem overwhelming.

 Put a smile on your face when you go out, even if you feel nervous. Treat other people with courtesy and thoughtfulness. Instead of complaining, put a positive spin on your comments. Other people will like being around you if you’re upbeat and happy., If you’re shy about meeting new people, start by getting out of the house and doing things you like. Breaking the ice with someone new is easier when you can connect over an activity or a shared interest.For instance, you could join a group related to one of your hobbies, volunteer for a cause you care about, or sign up for a competition.
 You may already have a stronger support network than you realize. People like parents, teachers, coaches, and siblings can support and inspire you as you build up your strengths. Make time for the people you care about, and don’t be too shy to ask for help and advice when you need it., Don’t rush to befriend people you just met. Get to know people slowly, and invest your time and energy into those who care about you and treat you well. It’s better to have one close, trustworthy friend than it is to have many shallow friendships.

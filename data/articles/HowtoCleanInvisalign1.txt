 Take out the Invisalign according to the instructions you received from your dentist. Unlike metal braces which need to be cleaned around, Invisalign must be cleaned on the outside of your mouth.;
, Use toothpaste and a soft toothbrush, just as you would when brushing your own teeth. Gently brush away any food particles on both sides of the aligner. Clean it thoroughly.
 Run the Invisalign under a steady stream of lukewarm water to rinse off any toothpaste and mouthwash. Allow the Invisalign to dry on a clean towel before putting it back onto your teeth.


Never rinse your Invisalign with hot water, as this could melt and permanently damage the aligners.
Some dentists recommend not using toothpaste, as it often contains abrasive ingredients that leave scratches on your trays. Over time, the aligners become more visible. If this is a concern, brush with water only, or using a mild dish detergent., While the Invisalign is out of your mouth to be cleaned, be sure to brush your bare teeth. Floss as well, to keep food particles and bacteria from hiding between your teeth. Keeping your teeth clean and healthy will help to keep the Invisalign pieces clean.
 Once the aligners have dried, you can reinsert them as directed by your dentist.

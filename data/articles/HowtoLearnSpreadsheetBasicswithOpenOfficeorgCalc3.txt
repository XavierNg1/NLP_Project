A cell is the fundamental element of a worksheet. This is where things are added and where things are seen. A cell address in a spreadsheet identifies the location of the cell in the spreadsheet. A cell address is a combination of the column letter and the row number of a cell, such as A2 or B16.etc. When identifying a cell by its address, the column letter is always listed first followed by the row number. The cell address of the example below is A5.


Click on the A1 cell (The cell at the very top left of the spreadsheet).





Notice the heavy black border around the A1 cell. The heavy black border indicates that A1 is the active cell. (A is at the top of the first column and 1 is on the first row. Both are highlighted. The highlighting also indicates that A1 is the active cell.)

The active cell is now A2. (The words “Hello World” are in A1.)


When you type something in a cell and press Enter, what you typed is seen in that cell and the cell below becomes the next active cell.

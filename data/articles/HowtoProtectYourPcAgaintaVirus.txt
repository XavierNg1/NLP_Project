 Be sure to keep this up to date and do weekly full scans and updates.;
, This will allow your computer to automatically download any updates to both the operating system (i.e. Windows) and Internet Explorer. These updates fix security holes in both pieces of software.
, To further reduce the possibility of getting a virus or similar please read the following advice:,, Here are 2 scenarios:

, You get an Email from someone you DON'T know. You open it. It tells you (or, persuades you) to click on a link in the Email. You do so. That is when you get infected. Frequently, the Email appears to be from a bank or a company you know. Do not fall for this. Businesses do not normally send unsolicited Email.
 You get (what appears to be) an Email from someone you DO know. Unknown to you, a virus generated that Email (and not your friend). It could be that your friend's computer is infected, but, not always. Obviously, the actual Email writer doesn't know you and cannot say anything personal to you, so, typically, it says something like "Click on this link for some important information... “. You are now infected.
, The same caution should be used with opening links and attachments as Emails.
 In addition, do not download software or “Add-ons” from web sites that you are unfamiliar with. This includes sites such as “Facebook” and “MySpace”.
,, Of course, you can run a virus scan on it first, but Anti-Virus programs are not 100% effective.
, This includes torrents or other forms of P2P activities (Limewire for example). Staying away from these sites and programs is in your computer's health's best interest, as well as a good way to avoid being sued for copyright violation.

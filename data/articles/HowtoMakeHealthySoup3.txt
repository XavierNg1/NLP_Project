 A lot of casserole, sauce, and gravy recipes call for canned "cream of..." soup. Unfortunately, many condensed, canned soups can be high in fat, sodium, and other unhealthy ingredients. Fortunately, it is easy to make your own. This section will teach you how.
 Cut up 3 tablespoons (45 grams) of butter, and add it to a small saucepan. Allow the butter to melt over medium head.
 Add 3 tablespoons (22.5 grams) of white flour into the butter. Stir it briskly with a fork or mini whisk to combine. Cook the mixture, stirring frequently, until it turns thick.
 Stir it with a whisk until the flour mixture dissolves and everything turns smooth. If your recipe calls for another type of condensed or "cream of..." soup, you can use a different type of stock. You can also dissolve some bouillon in Â½ cup (120 milliliters) of water.


For a healthier option, use low-sodium chicken stock.
To make cream of mushroom: cook some chopped mushrooms along with the butter. Add the flour and a spoonful of sour cream., If you are looking for a healthier soup base, use low-fat milk. You could also try a non-dairy milk if you are vegan or lactose-intolerant.
 How much salt and pepper you add is entirely up to you. If you are looking to restrict your sodium-intake, consider using less salt, and adding other spices instead.
 This soup is meant to be used as a substitute for canned, condensed soup in dishes such as casseroles and gravies. If you want to serve it as an actual soup, you will need to add about 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water.


You can store this in the fridge for a few days, but it will taste best while it is fresh.

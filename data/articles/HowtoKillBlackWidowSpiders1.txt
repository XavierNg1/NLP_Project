 Black widows hole up in seldom-disturbed areas, such as woodpiles, storage boxes, the back of closets, and so on. Not only will cleaning these areas eliminate potential habitats, you'll also get rid of areas for black widow prey to live.


Wear gardening gloves. Just in case you do stumble over a spider, your hands will be safe from bites.
De-clutter. If you have unnecessary boxes, wood or other items crowding your house, getting rid of them can remove potential hiding places.
Vacuum. If you have a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment, use it to clean out dark nooks and crannies. If you see a web without a spider in it, the vacuum is your best bet. Just be sure to seal the bag and dispose of it (outside the house) as soon as you're done so nothing can escape back into your home.
Spray down the outside of your house. Use a high-pressure hose to destroy webs and egg sacs. Pay particular attention to window wells, window frames, and door frames.
Clear vegetation that is in direct contact with your home. Ivy and other plant life on your house or around its perimeter provide a home for these pests.
Clean regularly. Chores like vacuuming and keeping your living area clean aid in preventing spider infestation. Vacuuming is especially important because it clears out dust, eggs and the spiders themselves.;
, The best method to avoid black widows is prevention. By keeping your doors and windows caulked, you are taking an important step in preventing spiders and other insects from getting into your home. Weatherproofing your exits is also very helpful.
 If you suspect that your black widow problem is bigger than you can handle on your own, call a professional who's licensed to use heavier insecticides. If possible, ask around a few different businesses for quotes depending on the size of your house and the suspected severity of the infestation.

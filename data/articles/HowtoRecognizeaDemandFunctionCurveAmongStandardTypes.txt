 But Excel only accepts x values first in the left most column, then however many dependent y variable columns one wants. However, Excel allows one to reverse the columns when charted, so that it all works out for cases like this one in which x is the dependent variable. We will be using tricks like taking the standard formula for a line, y = mx + b, and standing it on its head to become x = mP +b where P=y; we can do so because the dependent and independent variable have exchanged roles. Open the Excel workbook from the previous article, How to Find and Analyze Demand Function Curve and access the Demand Curves worksheet, or open a new workbook and create the worksheet afresh.
 Here's a picture of what all the beginning Column Headings look like:

Into cell B1, enter Factor in font red, aligned center. Into cell C1, enter 1 and Format Cell Fill Yellow, aligned center, Insert Name Define Name Factor to cell $C$1.
Into cell C2, enter 5 STRAIGHT LINE DEMAND CURVES, aligned left. Insert New Comment: "X = ap + b where p=Y. This is inverse of the normal linear function and means that Demand is a function of Price, where price is graphed in the normal y vertical axis, i.e. f(y) = Dx. The b is the x intercept, not the y intercept. Slope a is Rise/Fall in Price P=Y over Run in Units Demanded, X, but this is multiplied by y=p to produce units x after adding in the x intercept b. The x-intercept embodies all non-price related info about Unit Demand because it occurs where Price = 0 and the Supply of Unit Demand is at a maximum."
Into cell A3, enter Y = p and copy this and paste it to cell B3. p = price.
Into cell B2, enter Factored and do Format Cells for cell range B2:B3 Border black bold outline, aligned center.
Select Row 3 and align center. Select C3:G3 and Format Font blue.
Into cell C3, enter X1=-4p+120
Into cell D3, enter X2=-20p+100
Into cell E3, enter X3=-4p+100

Into cell G3, enter X5=-10/3p+100

,

Copy cells B2:B3 and paste them to cells H2:H3.
Enter to I2 2 Pressured DEMAND CURVES and Insert New Comment: "The 'pressures' that create the curves are discussed in the TIPS section of the wikiHow article, 'How to Recognize a Demand Curve Among Standard Types', and are the same factors that shift demand inwards and downwards, price-wise."
Into cell I3, enter X6=50/(p-10)
Into cell J3, enter X7=100/(p-15)

,

Copy cells H2:H3 and paste them to cells K2:K3.
Enter to L2 4 Pressured DEMAND CURVES WITH MINIMUM SUPPLY and Insert New Comment: "The 'pressures' that create the curves are discussed in the TIPS section of the wikiHow article, 'How to Recognize a Demand Curve Among Standard Types', and are the same factors that shift demand inwards and downwards, price-wise. For this group of curves, three also have a minimum Supply of Unit Demand, i.e. X8, X10 and X11. Raising p to the power of an increasing price, especially when it's in the denominator, has the effect of heightening vertical price sensitivity, making it more steep per not much change in units demanded at certain particular levels of overall demand."
Into cell L3, enter X8=100*(0.9^p)
Into cell M3, enter X9=80*(.85^p)
Into cell N3, enter X10=60/sqrt(p+1)

Should you change the factor, the formulas will need to be re-copied and the zeroes and error values eliminated again.
, These will come out with Y=price on the x-axis bottom and Units Demanded or Sold along the vertical axis, which is the opposite of normal for Economics.
Click on one series, and do menu item Chart Source Data, and exchange the column values for the X and Y values. For example, for Series X1=-4p+120, the X-values need to end up reading as "='Demand Curves'!$C$4:$C$74" (w/o quotes) and the Y-values need to read as "='Demand Curves'!$B$4:$B$74" after exchanging C's and B's. Do this for all the series listed at left, X1 to X5. Show empty cells as Gaps.
Do Chart Layout and fill in the Chart Titles and Vertical and Horizontal Axes Labels as per the picture above.
Repeat the above process for the other two Demand Function Curve Types.

 Many scrapbooking projects will benefit from having multiple adhesives at your disposal. Having many adhesives will allow you to temporarily position a photograph, make a short note about a memory, or permanently glue a banner or heading. Wet and dry adhesives come in permanent, repositionable, and temporary types, which means some are best for permanent adhesion while others allow you to keep items in place before firmly adhering them., Wet adhesives, or glue, come in liquid, paste, stick, or spray forms, and are generally more permanent and take longer to dry.As wet adhesives tend to be more permanent, they are often best suited for more permanent choices, like headings, banners, and photo mats.
Although wet adhesives are generally stronger and more permanent, there are a few that allow for a longer working time before drying.
 Dry adhesives, such as tape, tabs, dots, and photo corners, tend to be easier to remove and modify, and tend to mount items instantly.Dry adhesives tend to be less permanent and are more easily repositioned. Keep dry adhesives on hand to temporarily hold items in place, adhere photographs, and to keep your options open.
There are a few dry adhesives that are designed to instantly stick to whatever surface they are placed on, so be sure to double check which is which.
 Acidic adhesives will destroy the quality of photographs and paper overtime. Even trace exposure to acidic adhesives can cause lasting effects and further deteriorate your paper or photograph.


Avoid sticky notes. The adhesive on the backs of sticky notes is acidic! Even if applied momentarily, the acid will affect and damage your paper or photograph.
Always read the label. If you are unsure as to whether your adhesive is acidic, throw it out or set it aside for another project. Better safe than sorry!
Beware of adhesives with strong odors. Adhesives that have strong odors are more likely to be acidic and damaging to the items in your scrapbook.

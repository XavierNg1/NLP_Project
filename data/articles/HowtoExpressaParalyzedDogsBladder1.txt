 Possible medical issues that can arise in a dog that can't urinate include urinary tract infections and urine scalding, in which the shin is burned by long term contact with urine.An overflowing or leaking bladder is an invitation to urinary infections, which, if not treated, can lead to lethal complications.
It is also important not to allow bladders to overflow because this can lead to loss of bladder tone. Then, when a dog might recover its bladder control, the bladder will not function correctly.;
, Deciding to help your dog urinate is a major commitment. You will have to do it about 4-6 times a day.


Luckily it only takes about 10 - 20 seconds each time. Still, many vets do not encourage people to try expressing their dog's bladder because it takes such an intense commitment. Unfortunately, the main option other than manually emptying a dog's bladder is to euthanize the dog.
 With the bladder, you have to empty it often or the dog will become poisoned by its urine. Urine will not come out by itself; it will only overflow what the bladder CANNOT contain as more urine flows into the bladder from the kidneys. The rest stays put. That's one reason why disabled dogs are so prone to urinary tract infections.


What about the poop? The poop is really different from the pee. The poop will come out on its own, without your helping, eventually. There's no risk of it staying inside and causing infection.
 If necessary, the next day go back and express under supervision of the vet or his vet tech to make sure you have gotten all the urine out of your dog's bladder.

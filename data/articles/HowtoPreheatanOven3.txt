 High-altitudes will impact the baking time, temperature, and even the ingredients. Most recipes were not designed for high-altitudes and will need adjustments. If you are at 3,000 feet (914.4 meters) or higher, you will need to adjust your recipe.
 When you turn on your oven, you will need to set the temperature higher than what is stated in the recipe. If you are at 3,000 feet (914.4 meters) or higher, you will need to increase your baking temperature by 15°F to 25°F (9°C to 14°C)If you are between 7,000 feet and 9,000 feet (2133.6 meters to 2743.2 meters), consider increasing the baking time instead.If you are at 9,000 feet (2743.2 meters) and higher, increase the temperature stated in the recipe by 25°F (14°C). Then, as soon as you place your food inside the oven, lower the temperature back to the temperature stated in the recipe., Since you are increasing the temperature, your items will be finished sooner than what is stated in the recipe. For every 6 minutes of baking time stated in the recipe, decrease your baking time by 1 minute.


For example, if your recipe needs to be baked for every 30 minutes, decrease the baking time, and bake for 25 minutes instead.
 Most ovens are warmer towards the bottom, and this is where you should consider placing your dishes to ensure that they get cooked properly.

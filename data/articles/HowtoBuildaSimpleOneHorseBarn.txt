 It is built with poles that are 4 x 4-inches (10.16 x 10.16 cm). These protected posts, or utility poles, are set in a grid 8 feet (2.44 meters) apart.;

The barn, depending on your location, can be enclosed on 3 sides (or with half of the front covered).
Another choice is to open it on the side, facing the sun in winter. This way you will have prevailing winds for summer cooling of the horse.
Make the roof from fiberglass or sheet metal. Both of these come in varying lengths and are 26 inches (10.14 cm) wide. The wall cladding is the same material used for the roof.
 Make sure you keep the posts square to each other when you lay out the post locations. Remember, it is in 8-foot (2.44 meter) grids. You will need 6 post locations for an 8 x 16-foot (2.44 x 4.88-meter) shed.
 61 to 1.22 meters) deep and 1 foot (. 3 meters) wide. Opt for the measurements to be 4 feet (1.22 meters) deep if your climate has a lot of freeze and thaw cycles. Moderate climates require 2 feet (. 61 meters).
 Pour a premixed sack of concrete into the hole around the post, up at least 1 foot (. 3 meters). Wait a couple of days for the concrete to set and then backfill the remainder of the way with dirt dug from the holes.
 Keep checking as you go to ensure your post is square. Use a string line run on the back and front to keep the center post in-line.
 Run a skirt board on one side of the front if the ban is to be closed off. This is usually an 8-foot (2.44 meters) section of the front.


Use 2 x 4-inch (5.08 x 10.16 cm) wood grits, or lattice board, 2 feet (. 61 meters) apart from the bottom of the skirt board to the top of the wall on 3 sides.
Opt for 2 x 6-inch (5.08 x 15.24 cm) treated wood board all around the outside of the pole barn for the roof frame to sit on the top grit.
Set the stringer top edge (on the side wall section) 6 feet (1.83 meters) from the ground. Now raise the front end up to the 8-foot (2.44 meters) mark on the front.
Cut the post off flush with the roof stringers.
, Nail the 2 x 4-inch (5.08 x 10.16 cm) wood flat on 1 end.
,


The holes are pre-drilled and use special #12 2-inch (2.12 cm) metallic steel hex drill-point roofing screws.
Cut to fit using a circular saw fitted with a metal cutoff blade on the sloped sides.
 Add doors to the front, if needed, by building a 2 x 4-foot (. 61 x 1.22-meter) frame. Use the same sheet metal as the roof and walls, and hang it from the post.

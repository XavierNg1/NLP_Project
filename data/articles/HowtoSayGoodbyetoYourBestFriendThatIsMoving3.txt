 Spending a day doing the things you've always loved to do together is a fun way to say goodbye. You could do something special like going to a baseball game or concert. Go out to dinner at your friend's favorite restaurant, or cook dinner at your place for a more intimate setting.
 If you and your friend go to the same school, have a lunchtime celebration with your other friends. Have everyone decorate your friend's locker with well wishes, and bring in treats to share at lunchtime in her honor.
 If you and your friend have other friends in common, give your friend a great send-off with a party. It can be a surprise or not - you know your friend best, so you decide. You could choose to have a party with a theme or just keep it simple by gathering at a restaurant for a goodbye dinner.


Tell everyone who is invited to write down a fun memory that involves your best friend. At the party, take turns reading the memories.

Bake or buy a goodbye cake to share at the party. Write WE'LL MISS YOU! with your friend's name across the top of the cake.

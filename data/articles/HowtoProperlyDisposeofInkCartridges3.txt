 Reusing ink cartridges is low-cost and very environmentally friendly, but you do have to wait while the cartridges are cleaned and refilled.
 Some cartridges are not designed for refill. Others also may not be accepted by retailers for various reasons.
 Major retailers like Walgreens or Costco will fill empty cartridges for a fee.

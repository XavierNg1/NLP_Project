 Go to class prepared--look at your class syllabus and write down which texts you should read before each class. Make a schedule for how much reading you will do every day. It’s important to do the reading before class so that you understand the lecture or discussion while it’s happening, rather than being confused and unprepared in the moment.
 While you read, take notes where you summarize what’s happening in your own words, note unfamiliar words, and write your thoughts down. Reread a text if you find it dense or confusing the first time--sometimes professors and teachers choose challenging texts that deserve a second look. In order to maximize productivity, take a ten minute break for every fifty minutes that you read.
 Keep a dictionary near where you study, and write down the names and definitions of unfamiliar words you come across. If your teacher or professor allows it, use websites such as Sparknotes, Shmoop, and BookRags for plot summaries and refreshers on character names. These sources, however, should only serve to supplement your basic knowledge of the assigned texts. All your thinking and ideas for your essays should come only from you.
 Maybe you have a good friend in the class with whom you can chat over coffee or you want to organize a weekly study group. Talking about the assigned texts in a group can help you gain new understandings of the text, answer your questions, and get further enjoyment out of what you read. If your literature class has exams, your study group can help you review the important plot points, details, and themes in the assigned texts.

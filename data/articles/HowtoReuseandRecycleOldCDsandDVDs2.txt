 To do this, glue 5 or 6 CDs together, and run your phone charger cord up through the bottom. Tape the charger cord to the bottom of the CD stack to hold it in place. Done in this way, you'll always have a proper place to rest your phone overnight.
 Stack an equal number of CDs on either end of a threaded rod and secure them in with nuts on both sides. Leaving a space open in the middle, you'll have your very own dumbbell to lift for bouts of mild exercise.


150 CDS (75 on either side of the grip) should make a 10 lb weight.
 CDs are a perfect size to make a small album with. Glue construction paper onto each disc you want to use and place photos on them. Next, place a larger piece of construction paper that overlaps the backside of the disc and punch a coil binder through the protruding paper.Because CDs are thick compared to paper, you'll only be able to string a few of them together.
 If you have a lot of disc cases left over, you can turn the cases into a working organizer for your desk. Take a long stretch of cardboard as wide as a CD jewel case and superglue pairs of cases together in intervals.Leave the cases some time to sit, then organize your desk folders within each interval according to their type.


Paint or colour over the cardboard to make it look more professional. Aim to make the foundation colour similar to the colour used on the jewel case's album art.
 If you have no use for your discs, you can try writing a short letter on one and sending it off.This is especially clever if it's a CD-R and you burn something to the disc that's applicable to the letter or invitation.

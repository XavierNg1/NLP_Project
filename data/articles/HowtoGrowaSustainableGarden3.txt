Drip irrigation uses lengths of rubber hose with small holes punched in the side to distribute water along the roots of the plants. You can either make your own hoses or purchase a drip irrigation system.
Because drip irrigation distributes small amounts of water near the ground, there is much less evaporation than occurs with a sprinkler system and much less waste than with manual hose watering. Turn on the drip irrigation system in the morning to avoid evaporation by late-day sun.



Gauge your plants' water needs by feeling the dampness of the soil and watching the texture and color of the leaves. Do not water on a regular pattern or before or after rain.



Use rain barrels to collect water from gutters and pump this back into your drip irrigation system.
Collect waste water from your washing machine and recycle this into your garden. Do this only if you use biodegradable soaps and if you have not been using bleach. Consult your municipal authorities to make sure such water use is legal in your area.


Weeds steal water otherwise intended for wanted plants. Remove weeds by hand to eliminate the need for chemical weed killer.



Food scraps, leaves, and weeds can be recycled and broken down to produce fertilizer for your garden's soil. Place such material in a large bin with small holes punched in the side, then let the matter break down for several weeks before depositing in your garden. Most municipalities and local horticultural societies provide classes or guides for composting.



If you have a pest problem, opt for natural options like spiders (for insects), baking soda (for powdery mildew), or organic pest products rather than damaging chemical fertilizers. The natural options will allow you to target unwanted pests without harming other wildlife and plants.

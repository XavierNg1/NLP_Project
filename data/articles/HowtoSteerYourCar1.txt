 Be ready to negotiate split-second emergencies. Maintain as much control as possible over the car at all times. If your car has a manual transmission, shift gears when needed, but do not keep a needless grip on the gearshift afterward. Instead, return your hand to the steering wheel immediately.Turning on your windshield wipers, headlights, and turning signals also require you to remove one hand from the wheel.But these controls are typically located close to the steering wheel to minimize the time spent driving one-handed.
Reversing the car is an exception to this rule.;
, Resist the urge to slacken your grip on the wheel. At the same time, be careful not to clench the wheel too tensely. This can tire your arms out and possibly obscure warning signs that reverberate through the steering wheel.”Feeling” the car through the steering wheel is another important reason to steer with both hands.
 Picture the steering wheel as an old-fashioned clock with 12 o’clock as the apex of the wheel. With your left hand, hold the wheel at either 9 or 10 o’clock. Then hold the other side at either 3 or 2 o’clock with your right.10-and-2 is better suited for older cars or any others with larger steering wheels and no power steering.
9-and-3 has become the new norm for modern cars equipped with power steering, smaller steering wheels, and airbags.
 While driving on paved roads, hold the wheel with your thumbs hooked around the steering wheel. If you turn off-road, remove your thumbs. Place them along the steering wheel's rim, as if you were giving two thumbs-up.Hooking your thumbs under the rim while driving off-road may set you up for injury. Your tires could strike obstacles hard enough to jolt the steering wheel in your hand.If you are driving on a paved road with your hands at 9-and-3, nestle your thumbs along the wheel's spokes where they meet the rim.

 If you think you have thrush, then it is important t see your dentist or family doctor for an evaluation and diagnosis. If a medical professional determines that you have oral thrush, he will start your treatment immediately. Healthy adults and children can get rid of thrush more easily than others.
 Treatment for thrush in healthy patients generally starts with acidophilus tablets.A medical professional may also suggest eating plain unsweetened yogurt.


Acidophilus and plain yogurt will not destroy fungus, but they will reduce the infection and help restore a normal balance of bacterial flora in your body. Acidophilus and yogurts are both probiotics.
 Saltwater temporarily creates an inhospitable environment for the thrush fungus to live in.


Add 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of table salt to 1 cup (237 ml) warm water. Stir well before rinsing.
 Your doctor can prescribe an anti-fungal medication if symptoms persist or if you have a weak immune system.


You will generally take an anti-fungal medication for a period of 10 to 14 days. This medication is available in tablets, lozenges and liquid forms.
Make certain you take this medication as directed and in its entirety.
Antibiotics may also produce thrush especially in women or in patients who have experienced thrush in the past. In this case, your doctor may ask you to take an anti-fungal medication along with antibiotics

, Candida fungus often becomes resistant to anti-fungal medications, especially in people with HIV and other illnesses that cause weak immune systems. Talk to your doctor about amphotericin B if nothing seems to be working.

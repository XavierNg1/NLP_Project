 They may still be unlevel. The reason is that the top of the range is bowed down in the center. The frame around the edge keeps it level but nothing supports the center. Time and heat have had their way.

Proof: Put the level in the center of the top, pointing front and back. It shows level. Now slide it to the front. No longer level, right? Same in the back, because the top is dished. How about fixing it? You can do this, one burner at a time.
 This is fortunate because it won't wobble if you make adjustments--a three-legged stool never wobbles.
 Place the level on the burner above each leg and identify which is the high one., Take a little bit at a time. You only have to remove metal from the bottom of the leg where it rests on the burner pan, from the tip to a point about 3/4" back. Start by taking a little at a time and test-fitting after each pass., If you need to remove that much, leave the tip and file a depression behind it where the leg contacts the pan.
 In the future never remove more than one (or one big and one small) burner at a time for cleaning.

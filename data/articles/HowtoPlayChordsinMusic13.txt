 The 7 super-scripted above the Chord name means a minor seventh. The "C7" means to play the "C" chord (C-E-G) with a "B-Flat".
 A tonic and sub-dominant 7th will usually resolve into the tonic or sub-dominant, respectively. The dominant 7th is the usual way the dominant chord is played and will usually progress into another chord.
 In that case, play the regular 7th note. The 7th will invariable lead into something else, hence the term "Leading Tone".

 Fill a spray bottle with a few drops of mild liquid soap and water. Spray the headlight with this soapy mixture. Alternately, you could fill a bucket with soapy water and dip a clean cloth in it, then wipe the headlight with the damp cloth., Sprinkle a few tablespoons of baking soda into a bowl. Pour a few tablespoons of vinegar into the bowl. The baking soda and vinegar, when mixed, will produce a fizzing reaction.There is no need to carefully measure the volume of baking soda and vinegar you mix. Just add both in approximately equal amounts.
 Dip a clean cloth into the fizzing vinegar and baking soda. Wipe the headlight off using the same back-and-forth motion that you did when cleaning it with soapy water. The mixture will help your discolored, grimy plastic headlight get clean.Don’t worry about hurting yourself when dipping your hand in the fizzy mixture. The combination of baking soda and vinegar won’t hurt you.
When you’ve finished cleaning the headlight with the vinegar mix, wipe the headlights dry with a damp cloth or sponge.

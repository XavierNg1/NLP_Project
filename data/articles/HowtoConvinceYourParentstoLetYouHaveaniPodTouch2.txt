 You can find refurbished iPods for much cheaper than new ones. If you can prove to your parents that you can find a good deal, it might be easier to persuade them. A good idea is to show them the difference in prices. Say, “I don’t need a new iPod. If you get a refurbished one, you can get $50 off. That’s 25% off of the original price!”

, Your parents might think that the iPod touch is just an expensive toy. Prove to them that you can use it in multiple ways. Tell them that you can use it as a calculator, an organizer for homework, and a pocket camera incase you see something you want to take a picture of.


There are dozens of apps available on the app store that can boost your productivity, from note-taking to scheduling.Show your parents some examples of apps online. Mention how they could help you keep track of your schoolwork. Say, “The iPod can make staying organized fun!”

, Nobody likes to see a gift that was used once and then forgotten. Make sure to let your parents know that you won’t use the iPod for a week and then forget about it.


It’s good to prove to your parents that the new tool will just help you do the things you already do, but better. Say, “I’ll be able to use the iPod as my planner, and it will give me reminders for when to do my homework.”
Remind your parents of all the other things that you like to do. Say, “I really like listening to music as I walk to school. And I take pictures of my friends all the time! With the iPod, it would all be in one place!”.

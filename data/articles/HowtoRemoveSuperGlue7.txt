 A razor blade will do the trick and shouldn't harm the glass. If you manage to get the blob of glue off this way, simply wash off the residue with warm, soapy water, rinse and let dry.
 If you are unable to peel the glue away, soak it in warm water and try again.








Place the glass object in a bowl of warm soapy water. If this isn't possible, simply wet a cloth with warm soapy water and hold over the glue stain.
Attach a sheet of kitchen plastic wrap around the cloth with tape. Let sit for an hour or two to soften the glue. Then scrape off the softened glue with a blade or spatula.
Rubbing alcohol, eucalyptus oil or acetone can be used to get rid of any remaining residue. Wash the glass and polish if needed.

 The coup will either be successful and a new government rule will be instituted, or the coup will fail and the government will remain the same.


It might be frightening to know that violence is taking place in your country, but your best option may be to wait it out.
 If the conflict is ongoing and you can safely leave the country or travel to a safer region, then this may be a good option. Make sure that it is safe to travel before you decide to leave.


Try asking your local authorities about the safest route to take, or ask your friends on social media about the safest route to take if the local authorities have been overthrown. There may be roads that are blocked off or that are unsafe, so make sure that you know what roads to avoid as well.
It may be safer to travel at a certain time of day, such as early in the morning or late at night. Ask the local authorities or ask your friends on social media for recommendations about when it is safest to travel.
 If you are a tourist visiting a country where a coup is taking place, then you may need help getting out of the country.

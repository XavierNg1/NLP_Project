 It can be a party den, or you canÂ create your own.
 Use coffee tables as a runway and use strobe lights to light up the stage. Put a disco ball and a DJ station, and something for you, the host, to sit on. Make the stage big enough for 4-14 people, because you want in between that number. Put the Jamaa sign there, and more decorations. Put a prize on another side of the room.

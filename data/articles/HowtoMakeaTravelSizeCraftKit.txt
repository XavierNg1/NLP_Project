 Things like Braiding, Macrame, Origami, German Ribbon Stars, small Sewing Projects and Ribbon Bookmarks are perfect for this sort of craft kit.
 If you regularly carry a backpack or you can leave items in your car, you have more options than if you are carrying a tiny purse or have only the space in a pocket., You can't exactly take along an entire afghan, but you may be able to take along just enough for a few squares at a time.,

For example:
A small pincushion would require only fabric, a pinch of stuffing, a needle and a spool of matching thread.
A star ornament requires only the knowledge of three folds and a spool of gift ribbon.

Macrame Jewelry would require only a spool of jute and a bag of beads.
Origami requires only paper and instructions. (folds flat! Great for stuffing down the side of your purse for a boredom emergency!)

Dollar bill origami uses the cash in your pocket instead of origami paper, and is a great way to leave a creative tip and kill time while waiting for the check in a restaurant. All you need is small bills and instructions.
A spool of quarter-inch ribbon is all that is needed for a Ribbon Bookmark.
Two or three skeins of embroidery floss will make any number of friendship bracelets. Pocket-sized embroidery kits are available to make tiny ornaments.
A crochet hook and a small ball of string or yarn is enough for a granny square, motif, or other small project or part of a larger project.
Use your imagination. there are lots of fun things to do that take up less than a quart bag in volume.
,, You never know when you'll have a spare 10 minutes to fill!, A small notebook and a pencil can keep you busy for hours, and you might just create (or conceive) your next masterpiece while waiting in line. You can also use your notebook to dream up and sketch larger projects.

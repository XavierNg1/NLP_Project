 It's a black app with a white circle surrounding a black square and a line.

When you first install Uber on your device, the app will request access to your contacts.
 It's inside a white text box near the top of the screen., It’s below the “Where to?” box.

As of February 2017, this feature is only available in certain locations.
 It’s the large black button at the bottom of the screen., This gives Uber access to your contacts, so that you can type a friend's name into the Where to? box and request their location through the app.

You can restrict this access later on through your device’s Settings.
If you tapped Deny during setup, you can give Uber permission to access your contacts via Settings:
Open Settings (⚙️).
Scroll down and tap Apps in the "Device" menu.
Scroll down and tap Uber.
Slide the button next to Contacts to the "On" position. It will turn blue-green.
 Uber now has permission to access your contacts.

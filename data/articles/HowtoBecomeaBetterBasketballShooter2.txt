 To do an elbow drill, you will need to start by making shots standing on one foot. Standing on one foot will help to improve your balance and it will increase the difficulty of your shots as well. Start by standing near the foul line and making a shot standing on one foot.








You can stand on your left or right leg to start, but make sure that you switch legs halfway through your drill. Don’t just practice making shots on one leg.
 Standing on one foot should add enough of a challenge to start things off, so use both hands to make your shots when you first start doing elbow drills.Make sure that you keep your elbows in and point your fingers towards the center of the hoop as you make your shots.








Also, remember to find your shot pocket, create a “C” shape, and follow through after you shoot.
 Shooting in one position may help you to master shooting from that spot, but it is a good idea to practice shooting from varied positions. Try to cycle through some different shooting positions to challenge yourself in different ways.








For example, you could start out at the foul line, then move in and to the left of the hoop, then move to the right of the hoop, and then repeat the cycle.
 Move onto one-handed shots when you feel ready to increase the difficulty of your drills. Make sure that you use good form like you did with your two-handed shots. You may need to go slower until you perfect your form for one-handed shots.








If your form is really suffering as a result of switching to one-handed shots, then you can always return to two-handed shots.

 In order to find molarity, you need to calculate the number of moles of solute for a solution per liter of solution. Milliliters cannot be used. The general formula used to express molarity is written as: molarity = moles of solute / liters of solution


Example problem: What is the molarity of a solution containing 1.2 moles CaCl2 in 2905 milliliters?

, Calculating molarity requires you to have the number of moles and the number of liters. If you are provided with the volume in milliliters instead of liters, you will need to convert the volume into liters before continuing on in your calculations.


Example problem:

Moles = 1.2 mol CaCl2

Volume = 2905 ml



, Note that you could also simply move the decimal point to the left three places.


Example problem: 2905 ml * (1 L / 1000 ml) = 2.905 L

, Now that you have the number of liters, you can divide the number of moles of solute by this value in order to find the molarity of the solution.


Example problem: molarity = moles of solute / liters of solution = 1.2 mol CaCl2 / 2.905 L = 0.413080895

, Round off the number of digits after the decimal point to the amount requested by your instructor (usually two or three places). When you write out the answer, you should also abbreviate “molarity” with “M,” and state the solute.


Example problem: 0.413 M CaCl2

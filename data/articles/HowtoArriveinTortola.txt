 Are you looking to just save time? Or is money more important to you? Maybe they both are, or maybe neither one matters?;
, No commercial airlines fly to Tortola from the U.S. So your best bet is to hop on the cheapest flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico (SJU). However there are good flight options from Florida to St. Thomas (STT), which is a 50 minute ferry ride to Tortola.
 It will almost always be the cheapest option. You will only need to book one flight and have a cab get you to the ferry. The ferry ride cost between $25-$30 one-way. About an hour later you will either arrive in Road Town (the capital) or on the West End.
 Getting there in a hurry requires an extra flight. Most of which come from San Juan (SJU). There are only a few airline options commercially, there are a handful more charter airlines available. The options will be listed in the tips section below.
 Finding the quickest way to Tortola also happens to be the most expensive. You can catch a charter flight out of Ft. Lauderdale's executive airport (FXE) from Island Birds Charters.
 By air you will arrive on Beef Island (neighboring island just east of Tortola connected by a bridge) at the Terrence B. Lettsome Airport.

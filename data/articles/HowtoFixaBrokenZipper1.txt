 When your zipper just won’t budge, applying a lubricant can get it moving. Try rubbing graphite on your zipper’s teeth to lubricate them.









Purchase a graphite stick used specifically for lubrication. If you don’t have one, use a Number 2 pencil.
Run the pencil up and down the zipper’s teeth. If you want, you can just apply it to the area of the teeth where the zipper is stuck.
Wiggle the slider up and down until it moves smoothly along the teeth.;
, When graphite doesn’t work, apply a dab of laundry soap to your stuck zipper. The soap may add an extra level of lubrication that will help you get the zipper unstuck. To use laundry soap as lubrication:









Pour a small amount of detergent into a small dish.
Pour a small amount of water into the same dish.
Dip a cotton ball or swab into the mixture.
Use the saturated cotton ball to coat the teeth in the solution.
Place the cotton ball down and gently attempt to unzip the zipper. It may only move a little. If this is the case, return the slider to its original position. Repeat until the zipper is unstuck., If graphite or laundry detergent don’t work, you may want to launder the item and try again. Ultimately, washing the item may help remove dirt, grime, and other objects that hinder your ability to close the zipper. After you wash it, apply more lubricant.


Consider washing the item by itself. This way, loose threads, fuzz, or debris from other items won't get stuck in the zipper.

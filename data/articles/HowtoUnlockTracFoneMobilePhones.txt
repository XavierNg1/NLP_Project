If you did not buy your phone through TracFone, it is likely unlocked already, and no code is needed.;
, The representative will verify that your phone and account meet all the necessary conditions to be unlocked.


TracFone's unlock policy is available here.
Only GSM phones that use SIM cards can be unlocked. Other types of phones, like CDMA units, cannot generally be used with other carriers.
 You will need to have the 10 to 15-digit unlock code handy when you unlock your device.
 Contact the carrier you want to switch to for a new SIM card.
 Shut down your phone as you normally would.
 Depending on which device you're using, the SIM card will be in a slot on the side of the case, under the back cover, or under the battery.


Different phones require different methods for removing and replacing a SIM card. Learn to remove and replace your SIM card on wikiHow.
 Insert the SIM card from your new carrier into the slot.
 Instead of your normal home screen, you'll get a notification that your phone needs to be unlocked before it can use the installed SIM card.
 Use the keypad to type in the code you got from the TracFone representative.
 Now you can use your Android phone with your new carrier.

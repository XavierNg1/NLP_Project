 If you don’t want to commit to painting your entire wall, you can use stencils to add traces of pastels. You can find stencils at many art and home improvement stores. Choose a stencil in the design of your choice. Buy a pastel paint in any color, like light purple or yellow. Hold the stencil up against wall and paint the color onto the wall.Stencils are usually made of flexible plastic. Stencils in the shape of flowers and geometric patterns are especially common for walls.
Make sure not to get paint outside of the stencil.
 Painting the wall molding in your home is another way to add some color to the room without painting the entire wall. You can choose to paint just the molding near the ceiling, or all of the molding in the room. Consider the color your wall is before choosing a pastel color.For white or black walls, any color will do.
For blue walls, consider a light yellow.
For red walls, consider light blue or pink.
 Painting one wall in a room is a way to make the pastel very noticeable without taking up the entire room. The best wall to paint is the one that is directly in front of you when entering a room, or the wall that the couch side tables are in front of. Choose a color like light blue or green for a relaxing vibe. Choose light pink if there are reds in the room that you’d like to tone down., It is also an option to paint the entire room in a pastel color. If you do this, you should only have a few other pastel details or none at all. Too much pastel can take over the appearance of the room. That may, however, be your goal. Choose a color that can go with a range of furniture, like light blue or light yellow.Painting a room in a pastel shade can make a small room appear larger.

 Use scissors to cut a straight line from end to end on one of your toilet paper rolls. Then use hot glue to attach a sturdy paper straw or wooden dowel to the center of your bottle cap. Allow the glue to dry.
 Open your slit toilet paper roll and position the lid so it is ¾ of the way to one end of the roll, with the straw/dowel exiting the other end of the roll. Then:


Try to insert this roll, along with the cap and straw, into the uncut roll. It should be snug, but you should still be able to push the cut roll inside the uncut one.
Use your hot glue to attach the bottle cap and attached straw inside the cut roll. Position the bottle cap so it is ¾ of the way to one end of the roll. The straw should exit the opposite end., Cover the outside of your uncut roll with decorative paper to cover the plain cardboard. Attach the paper with either a glue stick or tape. Once the glue is dry, use your glue stick or tape to attach a taut layer of tissue paper at one end of the roll., Hold your uncut roll so the tissue paper covered end is upside down. Add confetti to this roll, then gently insert the confetti pusher into the open end of the uncut roll until it is ¼ to ½ of the way inside.


You may need to wiggle the pusher back and forth to position it properly inside the uncut roll. Be careful not to use too much force, as it could break your tissue paper seal and release the confetti., When the moment comes for you to launch the confetti, in a rapid motion, pull back on the straw/dowel of the confetti pusher slightly, then push it forward firmly. This should cause the tissue paper to break and confetti to fly out of the popper.

 This will give you a basis for making up your own word. English words are formed in several ways. Although one way is to create them from scratch, other words have been formed by imitating sounds. Similarly, there are many more words, often in quite common use, that have arisen over time because someone has not heard the word correctly. Next time you don't understand someone correctly, turn a potentially embarrassing situation, into a learning opportunity by creating a new word.
Find inspiration at home. Listen to sounds naturally found around your home. You may be surprised by how many words you can come up with just by turning off the TV and listening to the environment. Open up your window and let in the sounds from outside.
 You may need to do a bit of tweaking to the spelling, as was done with "cya," but try to think of phrases you can combine in to one word.


Write down some of your favorite two or even three word phrases. See if you can create one word.
 More than anything, creating a made up word is supposed to be fun. Donâ€™t worry about taking yourself too seriously. If you discover a great new word, share it with your friends and family and have fun using the word together.


To spread the word (pun intended), try using the word in a sentence, but be consistent.
Your new word will also need a definition, so have one on hand in case others ask you about it. This will help them understand how to use the word as it was intended.

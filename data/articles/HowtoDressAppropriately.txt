 Fold your clothes neatly, hang up your dresses and jeans, and sort shirts and shorts into drawers or baskets.;
, You don't want to go to the grocery store in your favorite Sunday clothes, and you probably wouldn't like to go to a fancy restaurant in your PJ's.
 First, choose a shirt or blouse. Then find a skirt or pants to go with it. Picking the top first helps you picture the entire outfit better.
 Jewelry is very important to the entire appearance, since it ties the whole outfit together and adds a focal point. Also, you should make sure that if you are going to carry a handbag or purse, be sure that it does not contrast too much. With shoes, be sure that they are comfortable and will not attract too much attention.
 Don't put on too much- you shouldn't want to appear fake. You don't want it to look like you have makeup on.

Less is best sometimes especially when you are older and start to have some wrinkles., A person is only as good as her personality, and you don't want people to think that you are sour or unkind.
 Copy it or as close as you can. Like what you wear and be comfortable in your cloths.

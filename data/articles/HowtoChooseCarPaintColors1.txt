 Be sure that you are thinking about what colors you like on cars and not on other things, like walls. Also, let the creative juices flow for now. There will be factors that narrow your choices, but a common insurance myth scares many car buyers. Rest assured, it is not true that insurance rates change at all based on a car’s color., The make and model of your car can greatly influence your choice of color. Many people wouldn’t choose the same color for a minivan as they would for a sports car. Mark any colors off of your list that you think wouldn’t suit the car you want to buy., Each make and model is available only in a certain variety of colors. Your dealer can tell you what color options they have for particular car. You can also do this research on your own ahead of time, but keep in mind that dealers typically keep neutral, safe colors.It is possible to special order a car. If you have the patience to wait for your car, you can order it in colors that the dealer does not have available., You want to make sure that the car you buy today is something you still want to drive a few years from now. Some colors come in style for a short period, and then they fade away. If you are driving one of these fad colors after it goes out of style, your car might be showing its age (and yours). Choose a color that will endure the test of time., Not only does your paint color affect how your car is perceived by other drivers, it also affects how your car is seen by other drivers. Having an easily visible car can possibly add an extra layer of safety to your driving experience. Drivers of silver cars are as much as 50% less likely to be harmed in an accident.Some colors also hide dirt better than others and boast a higher resale value than other colors (silver in particular does both).It is worth noting that white cars are also found to be in fewer accidents than other colors.

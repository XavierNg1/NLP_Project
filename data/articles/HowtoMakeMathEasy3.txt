 All math builds on other skills, so to make it easier on yourself, you need to figure out where you are now. You can find tests online that will help you establish what level you're at, so you know what you need to work on.For instance, you can try the UK's National Numeracy exam.
 Once you know what you need to work on, take advantage of online resources to work on your skills. In fact, many placement tests also have simple courses you can take (for free) to work on your skills and improve over time.Part of doing well at math is believing you can get better. Try to approach math with a positive attitude.
You can try the UK's National Numeracy courses, the BBC's Skill Wise, or a website like Khan Academy.
 Many adults were taught math by memorization as kids. For instance, maybe you just sat down and memorized the multiplication table for school. However, that doesn't help you understand how math works. When you understand how it works, it makes it easier to apply it to problems that you don't already have a formula for.For example, you likely know that 3 times 5 equals 15. However, if you've just memorized that fact, you may not have sat down to think about the why of it. Multiplication, though, is just a more advanced form of adding. This equation just means you have 3 groups of 5 (5 plus 5 plus 5 equals 15) or 5 groups of 3 (3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 equals 15)., Just like games are a good way for kids to learn math, they can also make it easier for you to learn. You can search for math apps or try something like King of Math to work on your math skills.You can also try video or online games that require puzzle-solving skills.

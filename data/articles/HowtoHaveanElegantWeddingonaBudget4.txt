 Instead of having a full bar, have a signature drink, provide 1 type of beer and a red and white wine. In some venues, you can even buy the booze yourself in bulk.
 Instead of doing a formal dinner with many courses, choose a favorite food and opt for a few sides. If you are open to trying something new, serve appetizers throughout the night, instead of a full dinner.
 You can order pies and cupcakes from excellent bakeries without incurring the costs associated with decorating a very large wedding cake. If the cake is not 1 of your focal points, choose based on flavor, rather than appearance.

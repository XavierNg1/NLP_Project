 Facebook allows videos up to 4 GB in size and up to 120 minutes in length. Make sure your video meets these requirements if you aren't able to upload it.
 Facebook accepts most common video formats, including AVI, MOV, MP4, and MKV. If your video is not in one of the accepted formats, you won't be able to upload it. Converting the video to an allowed format will allow you to upload it. See Convert Video to MP4 for details.
 If you're on mobile, you may have difficulties uploading if you have a spotty connection. Try to upload videos while connected to Wi-Fi with a strong signal.


Uploading takes a lot longer than downloading, so you'll likely have to wait a while for larger videos to upload.

 The formula for the area of a triangle is A=1/2bh.A = Area of the triangle

b = Length of the base of the triangle

h = Height of the base of the triangle;
, In this case, you already know the area, so assign that value to A. You should also know the value of one side length; assign that value to "'b'". If you do not know both the Area and the length of one side, you will need to try a different method.


Any side of a triangle can be the base, regardless of how the triangle is drawn. To visualize this, just imagine rotating the triangle until the known side length is at the bottom.
For example, if you know that the area of a triangle is 20, and one side is 4, then: A = 20 and b = 4.
 First multiply the base (b) by 1/2, then divide the area (A) by the product. The resulting value will be the height of your triangle!


In our example: 20 = 1/2(4)h
20 = 2h
10 = h

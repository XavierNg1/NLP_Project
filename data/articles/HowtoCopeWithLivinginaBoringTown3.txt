 If you want to move on, you should have a plan. Research, and, if possible, visit new destinations you might be interested in settling in. Consider what career and educational choices might be necessary to make it to where you want to be. Set a plan to reach those goals.


College is often a great opportunity to settle in a new town. Consider what colleges are around destinations you are interested in. Research what grades and test scores you will need to be accepted.
Generally, more desirable destinations are expensive. To afford life in a big, interesting city, you might need a better job and more qualifications. Research what the major industries in your town of choice are and what qualifications are necessary to get a job in those industries.
 In the long run, a job can give you the the work experience and the money necessary to move away to a new destination. But, money can also make even a small town more interesting. Since you will be busy, you wonâ€™t be as bored. You can use your new found resources to buy a car and commute somewhere with more entertainment options. You can even save up for a vacation.
 A boring town has few distractions to keep you from self-improvement. If you are young, use this as an opportunity to work hard to get into a good college. In the long run, this can take you some place more interesting.


Keep your grades up. This will be important for ultimately establishing yourself elsewhere.
Get involved in extracurricular activities. Being involved in sports and clubs will not only keep you occupied, it will help you get into college.
Develop your skills. If you dream of living in Paris, France, study French. If you dream of being the next Bollywood star, you will need to learn dramatic skills, singing, dancing, and so on.

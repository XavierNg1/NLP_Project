 States sometimes provide greater protections to workers. For example, they might require overtime pay for any time worked over eight hours in one day. If your state provides more generous wage or hour laws, then you’ll want to complain to your state’s agency, which is usually your Department of Labor.


You can find your state agency at this website: http://www.workplacefairness.org/complaint-pay. Choose your state from the drop down menu.
You can read a summary of your state’s wage laws at this website. If you see that your state affords workers greater protection, then contact your state agency.
Don’t delay. States have deadlines for contacting them. For example, Iowa requires that you file a complaint within one year of the violation.It’s best to contact them as soon as possible.
 Generally, you can call your state agency. Your state may also have a complaint form you can fill out. For example, states such as Arkansas and Illinois have complaint forms.Once you finish filling out the form, you may have to provide a copy to your employer.Generally, you will be asked to provide the following information to your state agency:


your name and contact information
your employer name and contact information
date of employment
type of violation (minimum wage, overtime, etc.)
how much you are owed
copies of your pay stubs, paychecks, W2 form, or other document

, Your state’s agency may schedule a hearing to review the evidence. Alternately, your employer might simply pay up the money that is owed to you.


If the hearing board decides in your favor, the state can sue if your employer still refuses to pay.

 Sex starts a prostaglandin release in the body that may result in cervical stimulation and dilation. Before having in sex at this point in your pregnancy, consult with your physician. In most cases, sex at this stage of pregnancy is absolutely safe as long as your water has not broken. Although studies to support the connection between sex and cervical dilation are not entirely conclusive, many doctors continue to recommend this method to patients who are becoming impatient with their pregnant status.
 Nipple stimulation releases a hormone called oxytocin, which causes labor to begin.Rub your nipples or have your partner do so for you.
 This indicates that you are in labor, and it's time to talk with your doctor or midwife. As the baby's head begins to press down on the opening of the uterus, the cervix will start to thin out and open. Your doctor can do a simple examination to determine whether dilation and effacement of the cervix has begun, indicating you may be in the very early stages of childbirth.

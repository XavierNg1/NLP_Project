 There are a variety of commercially available medications and dog snacks that can keep your dog calm. Look for natural snacks or supplements that contain relaxing ingredients like lavender, lemon balm extract, ginger, chamomile, and other antioxidants. Give your dog one of these treats, capsules, or supplements before you head out.You might also look for tablets containing L-theanine (a stress-reducing amino acid) and/or tryptophan (an amino acid that encourages relaxation).
Follow manufacturer directions when using supplements and medications.
 There are several wearable products that can help your doggie stay calm. One is the Thundershirt. Thundershirts are designed to help calm dogs during a thunderstorm. The other product that might help calm your anxious dog is the calming collar.The shirt slips on over the dog’s back and straps around its chest and stomach. While the dog is wearing the Thundershirt, it feels safe and secure, as if it’s getting a gentle hug.
The Thundershirt is available at your local pet store and machine washable.
Like a regular dog collar, the calming collar slips around the dog’s neck and stays secure with a sliding strap. But the calming collar releases pleasing scent pheromones for up to one month. These scent pheromones will keep your dog at peace even when you leave.
The calming collar is perfect for dogs who don’t want to take pills or wear a Thundershirt.
 Give your dog some unwashed clothes you wore recently that still have your scent. You could provide just one shirt, or a small pile of shirts, socks, and pants to help your dog feel close to you even when you’re far away.You might be surprised at what your dog likes. Try to include some stinky socks or sweaty gym shorts for your dog to sniff.
If your old dog’s sense of smell has been dulled, try another object or technique to deal with its separation anxiety.

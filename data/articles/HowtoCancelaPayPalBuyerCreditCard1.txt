 It may take some time to get through the automated call forwarding system and wait time. However, this is the quickest way to cancel your card. The customer service representative will hopefully be able to cancel the account while you are on the phone. They should at least be able to get all the information they need from you, even if the cancellation doesn't go into effect the same day.


Dial 1-866-571-3012 and wait for the prompts provided by the automatic telephone response system. The service center is open between the hours of 4 A.M. and 10 P.M. Pacific Standard Time (PST) on days Monday through Saturday, and from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M. PST on Sundays.;
, First you will access details for your PayPal Buyer Credit (Smart Connect) account. Press the number "1" on your telephone keypad to be directed to the menu for PayPal Smart Connect. Continue following the prompts provided to you by the automatic response system to access your PayPal Buyer Credit account.


Provide the automatic telephone system with your PayPal Buyer Credit account number. If you do not have your account number on hand, you may be directed to verbally say "I don't have it" to the automatic response system.
 You may be guided through the cancellation process by a series of automatic prompts. It is also possible that you will be transferred to a live customer service representative who will try to encourage you to keep your account open. When finished, ask for an email or other written confirmation that states your account was successfully closed and cancelled.


Write down the date and time you called to cancel your account, as well as the confirmation number for the transaction, or the name and employee identification number of the representative you spoke to. This information can be used as proof in the event your account was not successfully cancelled for any reason.

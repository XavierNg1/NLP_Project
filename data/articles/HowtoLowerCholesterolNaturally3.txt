 Watch out for dairy and meat products high in cholesterol, as these tend to sneak in to breakfast items. Alternate between these three example breakfast options:


Half a cup of non-fat vanilla yogurt and 1 cut apple (mixed), and 1 cup cooked oatmeal.
One cup of low-fat cottage cheese, one pear, and one whole-grain bagel.
Almond butter on whole grain toast (2 pieces) and 1 banana.
 Lunch is a great time to fit in vegetables which are high in fiber to keep you from feeling weighed down while you finish your day. Alternate between these three example lunch options:


Spinach salad with salmon, garlic, and cracked pepper. Use Italian dressing.
Naan topped with lean grilled chicken, cucumbers, and olives.
Rye bread sandwich with arugula, low fat mozzarella, garlic, and tomatoes.
 Dinner is another time when high cholesterol foods tend to sneak in. Avoid eating out or eating boxed dinners, as these are often high in cholesterol, saturated and trans fats. Examples of healthy dinners include:


Lemon pan-seared halibut, steamed broccoli, and garlic oven-roasted potatoes.
Quinoa with steamed kale and mackerel.
Grilled salmon and arugula salad with vinaigrette dressing.
 Eat one snack in between breakfast and lunch, as well as lunch and dinner. These are a great way to sneak in more fiber. Examples of healthy snacks include:


Celery and carrot sticks.
1/2 cup hummus and 4 pieces of broccoli.
1 cup of walnuts.
 Adults need eight 8oz glasses of water every day.

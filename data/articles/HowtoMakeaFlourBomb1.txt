 You will need a few supplies to create a flour bomb out of panty hose or socks. Make sure you have all of the supplies with you before you begin. You may already have all of the supplies in your home!Pantyhose or long socks.
Flour
A spoon;
, If you are using pantyhose, you need to cut one leg of the pantyhose off where it connects at the top before beginning. Open up the pantyhose or socks wide and use the spoon to fill it with spoonfuls of flour. Keep filling until the pantyhose or socks have enough flour to completely fill the toe part. You should have about Â½ to 1 cup in the sock or pantyhose., Tie a knot in the pantyhose or sock close to where the flour is. The knot should be a couple of inches above where the flour is. This should create a tied off pocket of flour with a long handle of pantyhose or sock to hold onto.
 Hold the long end of the flour bomb and throw the bomb up in the air. Watch the flour splat out of the pantyhose or sock as it hits the ground. You can also play flour bomb wars by getting friends together and making several flour bombs to use to gently hit each other with. The flour will leave a fun white spot where it hit you!

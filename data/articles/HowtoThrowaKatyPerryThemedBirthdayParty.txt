 This means, figure out the day of the party, the start time and the end time, where, extra information, and who you are going to be inviting.;
, You are going to want to send out your invitations about a week or two before the day of the party. If it is a last minute party, get them out as quick as you can! You can make homemade invitations, or you can buy some from a party store.
 Since Katy Perry lives in a Candyland, make a candy buffet. Katy Perry has grown up a little bit for her latest album Prism, so if you would like to go for that side of her, then buy some animal print things, and gold things (mostly representing Roar, and Dark Horse). Also remember you can hang pictures of Katy, and anything else you can think of for more decorations!

, If you are going to go with the candy buffet, then that's probably all you need for food, but Katy also symbolizes cupcakes, so you can also have cupcakes (you can also buy Katy Perry cupcake toppers on Google). If you are not doing the candy buffet, you can get a cake and some pizza.
 This is always an important part of parties; you don't want your guests bored, do you? No! Some fun game ideas are:


Pin the lollipop to the Katy: Just like pin the tail on the donkey. Get a big picture of Katy, put it on your wall. Print out a lollipop picture, put tape on the back of it and try to tape the lollipop to Katy's hand (get a picture of Katy where a hand is visible).
Katy's truth or dare: It's just truth or dare, but make it kitty-lisious by putting her name in front!
Katy charades: Play charades, but with a twist. Have you and your guest act out a Katy Perry song. Put Katy Perry songs on little papers and put them in a bowl, have some one pick and then everyone else has to try to guess the song. Make sure they are common Katy Perry songs, so everyone knows the song. You can also watch the Katy Perry movie! How fun!

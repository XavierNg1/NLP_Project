 Use a dreadlock that has a solid bud at the end of it. In simpler terms, the dread should have a tight, secure end. Do not use a dread that is fraying at its end.


Match the thickness of the dread to the size of the cowrie shell, too. The dreadlock should be thin enough to fit into the opening of the shell, but if the dread is too thin, it may not be able to adequately support the weight of the shell. This method works best when used with fairly thin dreadlocks, though.
 Slip the bobby pin over the dreadlock, sliding it along until the dread hits the bend of the pin.


Roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the dreadlock end should stick out from one side of the bobby pin.
 Twist the bobby pin in between your thumb and index fingers three or four times. The hair should wrap around the pin during this process.


The dreadlock should twist into itself, and these twists should actually begin to “climb” or extend onto the pin.
 Stick the pin into the front opening of the cowrie shell. Continue pushing it through until the entire pin pops out through the back side.


Make sure that you pull enough hair—1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.75 cm)—through to the back of the shell.
 Fold the tip of the dreadlock over the top of the shell, lining it up with the primary body of the dread. Twist a small hair rubber band over the end and this adjacent portion of dread, wrapping it around tightly enough to hold the two sections in place.


A small rubber band will be easier to work with since it will require less twisting, but it also needs to be large enough to fit over the cowrie shell at the end of the lock.
 You have successfully put one cowrie shell on one dread. Repeat this same process to attach cowrie shells to more dreads until you are satisfied with the end result.


Note that you can only attach one cowrie shell to one dreadlock.
This is another simple method. Depending on how tightly you wound the hair ties, it can either be more or less permanent than the method relying on tension.

 Always buy ribbon that is made well, carries a good colour and is recommended by the pattern. Pure silk ribbon is often a suggested preferred ribbon but there are other good quality ribbon types available, including rayon, satin etc. Cheaper ribbon from bargain stores may not be worth the savings in the long run; their fabric content can be questionable and the color might bleed if it becomes moist.;
, Embroidery thread is usually suitable for ribbon work but you should also be guided by the pattern's suggested thread.
 A chenille or tapestry needle is the right needle for ribbon embroidery. The large eye in each of these needles will make a bigger hole in the fabric, making it easier for the ribbon to pass through and less wearing on the ribbon.
 Ribbon tends to fray easily, hence it is better to work with it in shorter lengths so that it does not have to pass through the fabric too often. A good length to adopt is 30 centimeter (11.8Â in) / 12" long. This will provide adequate length to work with, without tempting fraying.
 Again, finish off with the same amount at the back each time. Stitch these tail ends at the end by sewing a thin embroidery thread through them from one end to the other or by letting embroidery stitches on the rest of the work sew through them. This will keep them in place without leaving bumps under your work.
 Work with a loose tension when embroidering using ribbon. This will help to keep the shape of your stitches and won't pull the ribbon out of shape, threatening fraying.
 Do this by making each stitch on the fabric and holding that in place with your thumb, and pulling the ribbon through at the same time.

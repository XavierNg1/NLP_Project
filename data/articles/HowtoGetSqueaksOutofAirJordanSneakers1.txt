 Listen carefully to the shoe when it squeaks to hear the source of the squeaking. Place pressure on different parts of your foot with the shoe on. Rock it back and forth. Stand up on your toes.Most likely, the source of the squeaking will be the insole of your shoe. In some cases, friction from the tongue of the shoe may cause squeaking also.Visible damage to your shoe, like holes in its fabric or rubber, can sometimes cause squeaking.
If you know the source of the squeaking, you'll be able to target this area with de-squeaking techniques, which may resolve your problem faster.;
, This will give you easier access to the insole, which can be difficult to remove for Jordans. Pull the laces through the metal grommets of the shoe until they come free. Place them off to the side in a safe place.
 If your insole is not glued down, it will pull free easily. If it is glued, pull the tongue to further open the shoe. Work your fingers between the side of the shoe and the side of the insole. With firm, steady pressure, peel the insole up and remove it.


Be careful not to pull too hard, as this may damage or deform the insole. Replacement insoles can be bought at shoe stores, drug stores, and general retailers.
Some glue may remain on the bottom of the insole or sole. It may also be tacky. This is normal and should not harm your shoe.

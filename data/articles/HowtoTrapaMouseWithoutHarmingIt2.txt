 Although there are multiple methods for constructing a nonlethal mouse trap, for this trap, you will need:


A toilet-paper tube,
A large 5-gallon bucket, and
Mouse bait. For this trap, peanut butter works well., This will let you set the tube down on a flat surface, without it rolling away.


To make each crease, fold the toilet-paper tube firmly from front to back.
, This should be done near an area where the mouse has been seen, or where its droppings have been spotted.


If there is no table or counter near the mouse’s area, move a table to a convenient location.
The tube should be positioned so that the peanut-butter end is over the edge of the counter. It should be about halfway over the counter’s edge.
 The bucket should be next to the table or counter.


Although some plans for constructing this trap direct you to fill the bucket with a couple inches of water, you should avoid this step. Trapping the mouse in a water-filled bucket will drown the mouse.
 You may need to wait overnight for the mouse to come out and seek out the peanut butter.


The mouse will walk across the table and through the toilet-paper role to eat the peanut butter. The role will fall off the edge of the counter and into the bucket, effectively trapping the mouse.

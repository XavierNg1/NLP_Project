 Unripe peaches should be stored separately from ripe peaches, and the proper storage method will vary based on a peach's level of ripeness.


Examine the appearance. Ripe peaches should have a yellow or gold tint beneath the reddish blush of the peach. Note that the amount of blush does not indicate ripeness; instead, it indicates variety.
Examine the texture by applying gentle pressure to the outer flesh. Do not squeeze the peach, however, since this fruit can bruise easily. Ripe peaches should feel firm yet soft, but unripe peaches will feel hard. Mushy peaches are overripe.
Smell the peach. Ripe peaches should have a strong, sweet fragrance. Unripe peaches will have a muted fragrance.

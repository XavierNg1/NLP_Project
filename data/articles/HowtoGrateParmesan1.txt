 You could also use a flat chopping board or a large plate, but you’ll want to make sure that it’s big enough to catch the bits of grated cheese that will be hard to contain.;
, If your grater has multiple-sized holes, use the side with the larger holes that produce an extra-course grate.
 If you are using a box-type grater, be sure to scrape the cheese clinging to the inside of the grater as well.


The colder your Parmesan, the less likely it will be that the grated cheese will stick to the grater.

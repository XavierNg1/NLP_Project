, You can go a few ways with your movie choice. Something you've both seen will make it more comfortable to interject comments and conversation, something boring will afford the same opportunity, something good neither of you has seen will be fun even if the kissing doesn't pan out.
 Avoid garlic, onions, spicy foods, and anything that would make you uncomfortable kissing someone.
 Put lots of cushions on the sofa and put a coffee table in front of it with the food.
 Start smiling and look at his or her lips.
 At some point, this will become instinctual. Do what feels right to you.

 Mark the bottom of the molding. If you mark the top, your cuts will be incorrect. This is because the bottom of the molding goes all the way into the corner, while the top does not.


Set your power miter saw to a 45° angle. Assuming you are starting with the left piece, the saw should be angled from left to right.
Be sure to place the ceiling part of the molding onto the deck of the saw table, while you hold the wall side facing you.
Make the first cut, with the saw coming down on the mark you made on the molding.
When in doubt, cut long so that you can shave the extra off. Cutting short can make the entire piece useless.
 Adjust the saw angle back to a 90°. Bring the saw down on you measurement mark, leaving yourself a small amount of extra just in case.
 Follow the contours of the molding and strip away the back wood . The idea is that the 45° cut will fit over the contours of the first piece of molding. Sand it down to remove any gaps. Test the coping by holding a scrap piece of molding up against the contours. Gaps should be minimal. Use a caulk gun to fill in any gaps that won't go away.

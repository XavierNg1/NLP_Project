 Party clothes, club covers, alcohol, and cabs home get expensive. Many famous party girls are actresses and heiresses. You may not need that kind of money, but you'll still need to make a decent living.


Be sure to work in a profession that meshes well with partying. If you're a doctor or nurse, you can't party while you're on-call.
Likewise, don't let partying sink your career. Don't go out partying all night when you have an important meeting in the morning.
 Not only will these people be responsible for preparing your fancy drinks, they'll be good allies in helping you meet more people and stay in touch with the "people who matter."


Tip well. Nothing spreads a bad reputation like being a cheap party girl. Make sure if someone is buying for you, that they also tip well. Bad tipping can make you guilty by association. If you're with a bad tipper, throw in some extra cash if you can.
 A party girl needs her beauty sleep to be refreshed for the rest of her life - and the next party. As with all good things, they come to end and a successful party girl knows when to call it quits. Don't let too much partying ruin your health.

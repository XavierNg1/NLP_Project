 Because you will be working with hot wax and will need to move quickly, it’s better to have all your supplies and stations ready to go before you work.

Lay wax paper down on a clean, flat surface. Your waxed balloon will sit on top of the paper while it cools.



 


Place wax pieces in either the double boiler or a large glass bowl.






Have heavy rubber gloves nearby and ready to wear.

, For this craft the water-filled balloon will provide the right shape and protection to hold the hot wax.


Don’t overfill balloon. You simply want it to create a vase shape so consider filling the balloon approximately 2/3 of the way with water and then tie the top.
 Depending on how you want to cook the wax, either turn the stove to medium-low with wax in double boiler or place bowl in microwave and cook on high for approximately 30 seconds.


Constantly stir wax as it melts. You want it to melt smoothly but not over melt and then burn.
Watch the double boiler constantly and remove from heat when 90% of the wax has melted. Stir and the remaining wax will melt.
Microwave the glass bowl in 30-second increments and stir in between heat times. As with the double boiler method, stir and heat until 90% of the wax has melted. Then place on a counter and continue stirring until all wax has melted.
 Before you do anything, glove up for protection. Hot wax will leave burns on the skin so it’s better to be safe than sorry.

Dip the balloon several times into the wax. In order to obtain that thick wax appearance you will need to dip, remove and repeat until you achieve the desired thickness.






Work slowly so that the wax adheres to the balloon and builds the coat.
 The wax covering the balloon should still be soft, but not runny. Balloon should be placed with the topside downward (so the bottom of the wax area should be facing upward)., The ideal drying environment is cool and dry, allowing for 24 to 48 hours of dry time depending on how thick you made your vase.,,,

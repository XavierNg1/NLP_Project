,, This icon has an “A” that matches the App Store icon.


If the keyboard is up, you will first need to tap the > button to the left of the message text field.
 This looks like a grid of four circles and is in the lower left corner of the app window.
 The app display will enter ‘edit’ mode.
 Do this for each app you wish to remove and it will be removed from iMessage.

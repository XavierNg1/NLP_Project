 If you need to, get a skirt that's a bit shorter for a preppier look. For a geeky look, get a longer one. If you just want to blend in, a regular length is 100 percent okay. WARNING: don't make your skirt TOO short or you might get in trouble for it!;
, Give it a style rating of 1-10. This will help you figure out how much adjustment is required.
 These should add at least 1 style point.
, Also, leave your top one or two buttons undone to look flirtier!.
 For preppy looks, tie your hair in a sleek, high side ponytail and tease/curl the tail. Geeks can do braids and ponies or simply clip up your hair. Try a mid-height ponytail to blend in.
, Geeks could stitch on things like "Maths is fun!" on their bag. To blend in, keep it very plain, with a cool logo.
 If you feel good, people will think you look good!'

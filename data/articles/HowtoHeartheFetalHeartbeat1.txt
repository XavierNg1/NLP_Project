 A basic stethoscope is one of the easiest ways to listen to the fetal heartbeat at home. When you are between 18 and 20 weeks pregnant, the heartbeat should be strong enough for you to listen to with this method. Simply place the stethoscope on your belly and listen. You may have to move it around a bit to find the heartbeat. Be patient.Quality does matter, so make sure to purchase a stethoscope from a reputable seller. You can find a wide variety of brands at your local drugstore, and even at a store selling office supplies. Or borrow one from a friend or family member in the medical field if you can.;
, New technology can make it very easy to listen to your baby's heartbeat wherever you are. There are several different apps that you can purchase and download to your smartphone to listen to the heartbeat. Some will even allow you to record the sound of the heartbeat so you can play it for your friends and family.These are most reliable later in pregnancy.
 You can buy relatively inexpensive fetal heart rate monitors to use at home. This can be a great option if you are prone to stress and are reassured by listening to the heartbeat between visits to your doctor. However, you should be aware that these monitors are not as strong as the ones used by your doctor. Don't expect them to be able to pick up the sound of the heartbeat until you are in at least your fifth month of pregnancy.Make sure to consult your doctor before purchasing an at-home monitor. Once you have one, follow the instructions carefully.
 Even when you are using the proper tools, there are many reasons that you may not be able to detect the fetal heartbeat yourself. It's important to know that things such as the baby's position and your weight can impact whether or not you will clearly hear a heartbeat. If you feel there is reason to be concerned, make sure to contact your healthcare provider right away.

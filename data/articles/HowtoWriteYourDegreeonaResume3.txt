 In general, you’d list your most recent degree first. However, make an exception to this rule if an older degree is more relevant or will make your application more competitive.For example, suppose you’re applying for an engineering job and earned an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering in 2009 and a master’s in graphic design in 2012. You should list your engineering degree first.
You might have also researched your prospective job and found that the department head who will read your resume graduated from your undergraduate university. You might then want to include your undergraduate degree first and place your education section at the top of your resume.
 You might want to include relevant coursework in some job applications. If you want to highlight particular course titles, you could add a subsection to your education listing.For example, you could structure your education section like this:B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, TX.Relevant courses: Thermodynamics, Properties of Engineering Materials, Solid Mechanics, Dynamics of Machines, Strength of Mechanical Components.
 If you include too many achievements and skills under your education heading, valuable information might get lost. Rather than include too much text under one heading, list skills and important achievements under their own headings.For example, instead of listing computer programs and other skills you learned at school in a block of text under your degree, put them in a separate section at the top of your resume. Be sure to include skills, programs, and other keywords from the job posting.

You should be able to easily find it with Harry's map.
 You'll see a large piece of bloodstained white paper taped on the board.
 You'll be given a clue entitled "A Tale of Birds without a Voice."

, You'll immediately notice that you're only allowed to press keys on one octave, and when you try to press the other keys, some don't produce a sound.
 Meaning, for this puzzle we will only be pressing notes on the piano that does not make a sound or are mute.
 The first stanza on the clue states that the Pelican is eager for it's reward—meaning, it didn't fly very far—as well as a mention of white wings, a clue that pertains to the the pelican being white. Therefore, the 1st note you should press is the closest white note that does not have a sound, which is D.
 The second stanza states that the second bird, a dove, flew as far as it can; however, the 7th note produces a sound, and since a dove is white, we will automatically find the farthest white note without a sound, which is A.
 The third stanza states that 3rd bird, a raven, flew higher than the dove. We already know that a raven is black and that the dove already landed on the last mute white key, hence the raven will be the farthest (last) black key.
 At this point, there's only one mute white key that is beside another mute key — it's the 5th key beside the 6th key (dove).
 The fifth stanza states that the last bird, a crow, "quickly" stops. We know that a crow is black, and a "quick" stop means that it didn't fly far, much like the pelican; hence the key is the 1st black key as it is the nearest mute key to the left.

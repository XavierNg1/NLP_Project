 The way you set up your store will determine the value your customers believe is available. Full racks and overstocking may reduce the amount of sales that you have, so decorate and display in a way that highlights your products.
 You will need to keep track of items, prices, consignment agreements, dates, returns, expenses and profits. It is a good idea to invest in a bookkeeping computer and software that will keep track of these important figures and your sales.


Train anyone who is involved with the business's day to day affairs on the bookkeeping procedures. Since you are buying, selling and consigning at once, figures can easily become lost or confusing. Your success depends upon keeping track of all aspects of the financial details, so that you will know if you are running at a profit or a loss.
Reconcile your bookkeeping on a weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly basis. Doing regular reviews will help you to deal with the large amount of information you are taking in in order to run your business.
 If you are passionate about researching the product and a good bookkeeper, you can adjust your business practices to bring in the most money. Focus on the product that sell the best and advertise for specific consignments in order to increase your merchandise base.
 If you are selling collectible items, then using an online auction house will help you to move more products more quickly. Be up front with all sellers about these practices, in order to ensure they are aware.
 Employees in a consignment store are often asked to take on consignments, so make sure they are well versed in what you are looking for and how to keep track of new items.
 Understand that your product may dictate when you sell the most, and reduce your quantity of consignments if they are unlikely to sell. For example, sports equipment may be more likely to sell in the summer and the types of clothing you consign will depend upon the season.

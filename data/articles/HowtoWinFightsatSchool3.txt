 Use his size against him. Attack his pressure points or groin. Aim the toe of your shoe for the area between the navel and groin. There lies a circular area of pressure points that will disable your opponent.
 Come back at him with all your strength. Keep your attacks to elbowing, kicking, or hitting pressure points and soft areas. Continue until your opponent is weakened enough for you to escape. Realize that you have a right to defend yourself if your life has been threatened. Go to the authorities as soon as possible.
 Run as fast as you can to a crowded area or even the main office. Although you may be tempted to fight multiple opponents for the glory, understand that you must be realistic. One person against a large group of enemies cannot win without severely hurting or killing himself.

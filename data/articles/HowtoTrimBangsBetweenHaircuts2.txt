 You will have a right section and a left section. It is almost impossible to cut all of your bangs at once, especially if you have an especially thick set of bangs. You should separate your bangs into sections and trim them one section at a time. Be mindful of the length of each section as you are cutting to prevent trimming uneven bangs., Comb out your bangs with a fine-tooth comb, stopping just short of your brow bone or the desired cut length. Hold this section of your bangs with your fingers, right above where you stopped the comb. You can now move the comb away. Hold your scissors and use them to trim the hairs at a 45 degree angle, rather than cutting straight across. Trim less than you think you need, as it is easier to trim a bit more than it is to have to grow your bangs out.


Trimming the hair with the scissors at this angle will prevent the bangs from looking too blunt and unnatural.
As you are trimming, be sure to trim in a straight line, even though your scissors are at a 45 degree angle, so that your bangs arenâ€™t uneven. Slowly and carefully trim the bangs until you finish the section.
 Unclip the other side of your bangs and comb them out, stopping just short of the brow bone or desired length. Hold the scissors at a 45 degree angle and begin slowly and carefully trimming the hair until you have finished the sections.
 Look for any hairs that you may have missed or any uneven places. Trim anything else that may need to be trimmed or was missed.

 If you want, you can use a coin, or other round object, to trace and make the circle totally perfect.
 This will be used as a starting point to draw the other lines on the volleyball.
 The lines should all be slightly curved in the same direction. The circle you drew should now be split into three sections.
 Both of the lines should be parallel matching the curvature of the other lines that you have already drawn.
 For example, you could write "Mikasa","Molten" ,"Tachikara" , "Wilson" , or "Baden" on the volleyball. You can even add any color you would like.

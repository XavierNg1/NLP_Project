 Sprinkle salt over the bristles of your roommate or sibling’s toothbrush. The next time they brush their teeth, their toothpaste will taste salty and disgusting.


Use a small grain sea salt or table salt. Otherwise, they may see the salt grains on their toothbrush and become suspicious.
 This prank is fun to play on people who are afraid of large bugs. First, print a picture of a large cockroach or other gross insect. Next, cut it out and tape it onto the inside of a lamp shade. When your roommate or sibling turns on the lamp, they will see the terrifying silhouette of the large insect and believe that a real bug is inside the lamp shade.Look for images of gross insects to print out on the internet.
Use clear tape to attach the insect cut-out onto the lamp shade.
 Find a bottle of clear nail polish and a dry bar of soap. Paint several layers of clear nail polish on the soap, allowing it to dry between layers. Next, place the soap in the shower or next to the sink. When your sibling or roommate tries to use it, the soap won’t create any suds at all.


Apply at least four layers of clear nail polish. The more layers you apply, the better this prank will work.
 Purchase several boxes of clear plastic wrap from your local grocery store. Next, wrap your sibling or roommate’s bed in tight layers of plastic wrap by running the roll around the entire bed frame. When they go to bed, they’ll have to spend several minutes struggling to remove the plastic wrap first.Try to use a few long pieces instead of many smaller pieces. This will make the wrapping harder to remove.
You can either wrap each pillow and blanket separately or wrap everything together in a tightly sealed package.

 Instead of mixing a new color of polish, you can paint the polish colors (or multiple colors) on a small makeup sponge, then place the sponge onto your nails and roll it to the sides of your nail, transferring the polish pattern.Use a Q-Tip dipped in nail polish remover to clean up the sides and edges of your nails.
 Paint a base coat of one color of nail polish, and let it dry completely. Then apply thin strips of tape onto your nails, and create a design with the tape (nail striping tape works best).Paint the space between each tape strip, using one color, or alternating between two or three.


While the nail polish is still relatively wet, remove the tape. Apply a base coat to protect your nails and help the design last longer., Paint your nails a solid color and let them dry. Use a second color of nail polish to dab on as a dot, or draw a thin line. Quickly take a toothpick and drag it through the wet polish, creating the design you want.This technique can use many different colors of polish depending on the design you are trying to make.
 Layer nail polish in a bottle. Take an empty bottle of nail polish and pour in several colors, one after the other. Do not shake the bottle. Dip the brush in, apply as usual, and you'll get a marbled effect.


The colors tend to be mix together fairly well with this method. If you want a more distinct marbling effect, try this technique using water.

 Since cyberbullying happens on electronic devices, you can use that same technology to work in your favor. Many phones and websites have ways of blocking people who are being mean to you.For instance, on your phone, you can likely block incoming messages and calls from a particular person.On websites like Facebook, try unfriending and/or blocking the person completely., Sometimes, cyberbullies are referred to as "trolls," and a common internet saying is "Don't feed the trolls." In other words, cyberbullies won't get any enjoyment out of bullying someone if the person doesn't respond at all. Try to ignore the people who are bullying you. If someone is bullying you on a particular website, try avoiding that website so you won't have to read the hateful things the person is saying and so that you won't be tempted to respond., Just like in person, it can help to keep evidence of cyberbullying on hand. Keep emails and messages connected to bullying, and you can even take screenshots of times when cyberbullying has happened. Try to record times and dates, as well. The reason you should keep this information is it makes easier for websites and companies to stop cyberbullying when you present this type of information to them., You can report cyberbullying to the website where it is happening, if it is happening on a social media site, for instance. You can also report it to your school if someone from the school is doing the bullying. If it is more severe, such as if someone is posting inappropriate pictures of you, you can even report it to the police. Just make sure you have your evidence with you when you do., Never give out personal information on the internet. Don't post your home address or your phone number, for instance. Bullies and other predators can use that information to find you, so you want to give them as little information as possible to use against you.

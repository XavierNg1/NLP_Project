 If you haven't broken your pencil tip completely and only need to return a dull point to a sharper tip, you may be able to do so by very lightly sketching on a piece of paper.









Your pencil should be nearly flat against the paper: hold it at about a 30 degree angle and sketch thin lines, rotating your pencil every couple of sketches.
 A slight variation to the above technique would be to hold the pencil at the same angle against a piece of paper or folder and gently move your pencil tip back and forth several times to create a rubbing (imagine that you are trying to evenly shade in a small area).









Keep the pencil as flat as possible against the paper, and rotate your pencil frequently. This may shave down some of the graphite so that you get a longer, sharper point.
 If you don't want to mark up your paper or if you don't have a spare folder handy, try rubbing the edge of your dulled pencil tip against the rubber of your shoe sole.









Again, be sure to rotate the pencil and don't push too firmly in order to protect against snapping off the tip or rubbing it down altogether.

The balance sheets in a financial report provide an overview of what the company currently owns (assets), the amount of debt owed (liabilities) and the profits it has made that will be paid out to shareholders (equity).
Use your company's preferred financial report template to organize the information. On this component of your financial report, you can place the assets on the left side of the page or on the top of the page. Present liabilities and shareholders' ownership in the company on the right side or the bottom of the page.;
, The statement of comprehensive income, also known as the profit and loss statement, shows how much money your company has earned and the amount of money it has lost during a year.


The top line of this statement shows total sales or gross revenue. The lines that follow deduct the gross discounts and returns of products, cost to sale products, operating expenses (including salaries and marketing expenses), and depreciation of items used to produce products such as tools and machinery.
After the operations and sales deductions, add income from interest earned on funds. If your company is paying interest on a loan, deduct that amount. Next, deduct income tax.
The remaining amount is your bottom line or the actual profits and losses during the specific earnings period.
 This section of your financial report is the statement of changes in equity.


To determine the EPS, divide total net income from the income statement by the number of shares currently owned by investors.
 This information is known as cash flow statements.

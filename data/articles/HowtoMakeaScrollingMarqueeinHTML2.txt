 Note that using the HTML marquee tag is outdated and strongly discouraged in web design. HTML files can be opened with a simple text editor If you are starting from scratch, open a text file and enter this sample code:



.<marquee style=”background-color:#000080;”direction=”right” loop=”20” width=”75%”>This is a scrolling marquee</marquee>


, You can change the background of your marquee by specifying a hexadecimal (hex) value, or a RGB (Red Green Blue) value after the "background-color:" part of the code. The default value listed in the sample code, #000080, is navy blue.


For example:.<marquee style=”background-color:#000080;”></marquee>

A full list of colors and their values can be found online., Change the “direction” attribute in the code to any of the following: right, left, up or down.


For example:.<marquee direction=”right”</marquee>


, The “loop” attribute controls how many times the marquee should loop. If you want it to run continuously, leave out this attribute entirely.


An example with the attribute omitted could be:.<marquee style=”background-color:#000080;”direction=”right” width=”75%”>This is a scrolling marquee</marquee>


, The text inside the <marquee> tag and the </marquee> tag will be the scrolling text of your marquee. Write whatever you want your marquee to say here.


For example:.<marquee>Watch this text scroll by!</marquee>


, Drag and drop the file to your browser to open. Your scrolling marquee will display on the page.

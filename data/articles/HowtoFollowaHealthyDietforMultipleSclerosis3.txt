 Shopping for groceries can, at times, be a difficult task for someone with MS. For instance, fatigue and mobility issues can make a shopping trip extremely tiring and it may be difficult to carry heavy groceries home from the store. In order to alleviate these symptoms, try using a grocery delivery service. Search online to find a delivery service in your area., If you struggle moving around the kitchen, you should try to reduce the amount of time you need to spend on your feet while preparing meals. One way to do this is by gathering all of the ingredients prior to beginning meal preparation. This way you will not need to get up and down while you are cooking.If you have issues with balance, you can install grab rails throughout the kitchen to help with moving around during meal preparation and clean up.
Cut vegetables while sitting at a table or countertop to reduce fatigue.
 Microwaves can have a few added benefits for people with MS. For instance, when you use a microwave instead of an oven to heat foods you can place them in lighter microwave-safe dishes. This will be helpful for people with mobility issues.Some people with MS have heat sensitivities that can be worsened while cooking over a hot stove. A microwave is an excellent alternative.
 If possible, share meal prep and cleanup with a family member. For people with mobility issues and fatigue, there may be instances when you canâ€™t cook on your own. Ask for help and share household chores.If you live alone, and sharing chores is not possible, you can look into using a food service such as Meals on Wheels. If you qualify, the program will deliver meals that are fully prepared and ready to eat or heat.
There are also multiple options for pre-made foods at the grocery store. Make sure you read nutrition labels to ensure they are not filled with artificial sugars and saturated fats.

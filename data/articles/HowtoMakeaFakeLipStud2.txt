 You want to start with a clean palette.Do not apply moisturizer or any cream to the area where you will be applying your lip stud. Simply wash your face and towel dry.
 You may want a second pair of tweezers for this. Holding the rhinestone down with one pair, you can use the second pair to lift the protective backing of the rhinestone off., Pick the rhinestone up and gently apply it to the area you want your fake lip stud. The longer you firmly hold the rhinestone in place, the longer your fake lip stud will last.

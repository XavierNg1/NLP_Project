 Capella's the really bright one in Auriga. It's very obvious, but don't confuse it with Vega, Deneb, Sirius etc. Aldebaran is the red one in Taurus.
 It should look like two reasonably bright stars (Alpha Persei and Algol the demon star) surrounded by a smattering of dimmer stars. The left-hand bright star (closer to Capella) is Alpha Persei.
 The other stars in the cluster should jump into view.

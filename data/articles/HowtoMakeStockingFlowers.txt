 This is basically oval-ish, round or like a teardrop, your choice.;
, Leave a small straight piece at the base; wind one of the wires around the other to secure the circle shape.
 You'll need each piece to be large enough to cover the circular shape you've just formed but not so large that it sags. Once you have a good size cut, use that as a template for the rest of the pieces.
 Wrap green florist's tape around to hold the stocking piece firmly in place.
 You will need five petals to form one flower. (And obviously, make as many petals as you want flowers in total).
 Bend the stamen wires in half so that the bead ends form 10 heads when bent up together.
 This piece becomes the stem, so make sure it is long enough. Wrap around the bent stamen pieces and the stem wire with florist's tape to bind in place. This forms the stamen centerpiece and stem.
 Place the middle two petals opposite each other around the stamen piece. Wrap with florist's wire to bind them to the stamen centerpiece and a little part of the stem.
 Wrap florist's wire around to bind them to the stamen centerpiece and a little of the stem.
 Take the tape all the way down to the base of the stem, to completely cover the wire.
 The flower is now complete but you may find that you need to twist the petals a little to make them appear more realistic. This is really a case of experimentation, so just play around a little to get the idea.
 Vary the colors for variety, especially if making a bunch of flowers (see next part).
,, Tie a ribbon bow around the paper.
 You now have a bunch of stocking flowers.

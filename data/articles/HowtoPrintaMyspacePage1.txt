 You can create a Myspace site for free. The site has been redesigned, and it no longer resembles the sparkly, glitter-filled Myspace sites of the past.


You can login using your Facebook login and password. Note that Myspace has rebranded itself by no longer capitalizing the "S" in the middle of its name.Myspace will ask you for basic information like your zip code when you sign up. The process is simple. Pick a user name that no one's taken, as well as a password, and you're in.;
, Once you login to Myspace, navigate to the page that you want to print.


You can choose from several pages within a Myspace portfolio, including your portfolio page, a page for photos and a page for mixes.
You are also able to add connections on Myspace. Many artists add videos, mixes, and songs to their mixes page.

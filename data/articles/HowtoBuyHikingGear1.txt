 If your day hike includes some hiking on rougher terrain, buy lightweight boots.;
, For longer trips, when you're carrying packs containing 40 lbs. (18.14 kg) or more of hiking equipment, wear a heavy-weight boot.


Wear sock liners to wick sweat. Purchase socks designed for hiking so you have proper cushioning and insulation if the weather is cold.

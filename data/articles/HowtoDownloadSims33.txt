 Torrents are a way to share files between computers. You can download all kinds of programs and media using torrents. Downloading Sims 3 if you do not own it is illegal, and this method should only be followed if your discs have been lost or damaged.


The most popular torrent clients are uTorrent, Vuze, and BitTorrent.
 In order to download torrents, you will need to find a torrent tracker. Public trackers will have most popular games, so you shouldn't have difficulties Googling one. Simply enter "sims 3 torrent" into the Google search.


When you are looking at a torrent tracker page, you will see a Seeders (S) and Leechers (L) column. The more seeders there are, the stronger your connection will be and the faster you will get the file. If there are significantly more leechers than seeders, the file may take a while to download.
Read the comments for the torrent. This will help you determine if it contains any viruses, as torrents are a popular way to spread them.
 After you find the torrent you want, click the download link to load it in your torrent client. After it connects to other people, the download will begin. Depending on the speed of your connection and the strength of the torrent, the download could take a significant amount of time.


The Sims 3 download is about 5 GB.
 Games downloaded through torrents often install slightly differently than games purchased legitimately. Read the README file that should accompany most torrents for exact instructions for installing the game and applying the crack.


The crack will allow you to play the game without entering your CD key. This is useful if you've forgotten or lost your key, but is illegal if you do not own the game.
Many games will come in ISO format, which is a disc image. It will need to either be mounted or burned in order to use it.

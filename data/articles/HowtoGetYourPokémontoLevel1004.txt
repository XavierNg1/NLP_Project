 If you don't care what moves your Pokémon learns, skip this step.


As you probably know, you can't choose what moves your Pokémon learns in the daycare. However, there is a way to manage that to a limited level. Assuming your Pokémon only learns a couple more moves you can change which moves will be deleted first. At the Pokémon menu, you can view the list of moves it has. You can switch the placement of these moves, by pushing the button that says "SWITCH" and placing the moves you want deleted first at the higher rows.
Bulbapedia makes a good choice to find out at what level your Pokémon learns new moves.
 Run or bike straight down to the Route the daycare's on.
,, This can be very helpful for accelerating Evolutions, learning a few tutor moves, and more. Go to the Pokémon center in Ecruteak City and get up to six Pokémon you want to max out happiness. The strength of all the Pokémon do not matter. (This is optional.)

,, Also choose this on the B button, preferably, to accelerate the leveling process.
 Come back in the morning to visit the Daycare Center, etc. By now the Pokémon in your current party would have maxed out their friendship levels, and your Daycare Pokémon probably increased in level by a ridiculous amount. (Do not forget to plug up the DS charger.)

 I usually start with the head because its easier for me. Make sure the legs, neck and face seem to scale or else you may have an odd looking body/horse. Don't add details like hair/mane or tails yet.;
, What type of horse do you think it looks like, is it a pony, a draft, or a normal riding horse? Does the picture seem like the horse is running? Standing? Rearing? Bucking? What background do you think should go with it?(If you don't want a background ignore the question.) Is it at the fair, in the wild, in a pasture, or simply in a stall?

, Paint horses usually have splashes of white all over their body. Appaloosa's can be white with brown or black spots which is called the Leopard coat, they can be a pure colour such as black and have white spots known as the Snowflake colour. Or Appaloosa's can be any colour with a white hind-quaters which the colour is known as white blanket.(When they have a white blanket they usually have white spots around the pure white area.)

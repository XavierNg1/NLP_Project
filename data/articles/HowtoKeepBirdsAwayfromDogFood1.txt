 Dogs stay in the best shape if they eat two meals a day. Feed your dog only as much food as it will eat in ten minutes. That way, it'll all be eaten and leftovers won't remain to entice the birds., Allow your dog ten, supervised minutes for mealtime. In general, birds will not bother your dog while it is eating. If any birds should show up, you can scare them away yourself.
 After ten minutes, pick up the dog's bowl and wait until the next scheduled feeding time. Your dog will adjust his eating patterns to get all the nutrition he needs in two ten-minute feedings.After a period of one to two weeks your dog should be adjusted to this new feeding regimen.
If your dog has not adjusted after two weeks, consult your vet for advice.

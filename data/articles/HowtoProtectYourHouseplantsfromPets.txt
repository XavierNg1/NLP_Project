 This is the simplest and most effective solution. Position as many of your plants as possible on high, inaccessible window ledges or on top of tall furniture. Hanging baskets are also a good option. In some cases, you may even be able to prevent a pet from jumping onto a previously accessible windowsill by simply crowding it with houseplants.;
, If you are worried about your pets eating your houseplants, you can place the pots onto tall plant stands. These decorative stands are an attractive way to display houseplants, and they keep the leaves out of reach of your pet's mouth. Unfortunately, these stands can still be overturned by aggressive, energetic pets.
 Many pet stores (as well as some nurseries) sell spray products that are meant to be repulsive to cats and dogs. One such spray product is sold as "bitter apple," and can be harmlessly sprayed on your houseplants. Regular application of these types of sprays will dissuade dogs and cats from attempting to eat or overturn houseplants.
 If you can't keep your pets from damaging your own houseplants, consider growing more attractive options just for them. Catnip, mint, and cat grass (which is usually a variety of oat grass or wheat grass) are 3 plants that cats love to nibble on. Having these plants available may lead your cat to ignore your remaining houseplants.
 If your chief concern is that your pets continually overturn your houseplant pots and spill the soil, you can opt for plants that need little or no messy soil. Succulents and cacti can be grown in a mix made largely of gravel, while lucky bamboo can be grown in nothing but water.
 If all else fails, you will at least want to know which houseplants are toxic to pets so that you can avoid growing them. Common houseplants that are toxic to cats and dogs include aloe, heartleaf philodendron, shamrock, and poinsettia.

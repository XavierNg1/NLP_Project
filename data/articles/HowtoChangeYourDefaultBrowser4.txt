 You can find this on your Home screen or in your App Drawer.
 This will start the Application Manager.
 Switch to the "All" tab to see all of your installed applications. Tap the browser to select it.


The default browser for most Android devices is "Browser" or "Internet".
 This will remove that browser as the default browser.


If "Clear Defaults" is grayed out, you either don't have another browser installed, or that browser is already not the default.
 Open an app that has a link to a web page, such as an email message. A new window will appear asking you to select the browser you want to use.
 Any links you tap in the future will now be opened by the new browser.

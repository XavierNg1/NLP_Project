 Your voice is a delicate instrument that has to be exercised regularly. Think of it this way: football players never go out on the field before a game without stretching to warm up their muscles. It is the same concept for vocalists before a performance. A good singer always takes his or her voice through the motions before rehearsing or performing. This can be done by singing on a vowel and changing keys each time, while going up and down the scale.;

 This is crucial. Refrain from singing, speaking, and whispering if possible. Stay home.
 Buy a personal steamer and use it religiously when you're sick. It will relieve your pain, lessen congestion, and deliver moisture to your vocal cords without overwhelming them. It will also loosen phlegm.
 Ricola is probably the most commonly used lozenge brand among singers because it is natural. Vocalzone throat lozenges are good, as well. Make sure these lozenges have pure, naturally-derived ingredients.
 This will give your voice more time to repair itself.
 This drink is a lifesaver. Some singers like to add lemon to the honey water; however, this acidic fruit may damage your already-sensitive voice.

 You should feel effort in your hips and thighs, but try to relax a little if you feel any pain in those areas. Hold this position for the recommended amount of time, breathing evenly throughout.
 Bring in your feet and have your knees align with your hips to get into table pose and rest there for a moment before repeating for the desired number of reps.

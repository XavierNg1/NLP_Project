 The Norwich Terrier is a stocky breed, with a fox-type expression. They should be no more than 10 inches at the top of the shoulders, and the distance from the shoulders to the point of the rear should be about the same as the height. This is what gives the breed a square look. These dogs weigh around 12 pounds.
 The small dark eyes are oval shaped and should be far apart. The medium sized ears stand up and are like the eyes: they should be far apart. The muzzle is strong and shaped like a wedge. The fully pigmented nose and lips are black., The moderately short body is compact and deep with a wide chest. The legs are made for digging and are short and powerful. The rear thighs are muscular and lead to low hocks. Front and rear feet are rounded and have thick pads. The tail should be just long enough to grab, and it is carried straight up., It should be a hard, straight coat and covers the undercoat. There is a protective mane around the neck and shoulders. Remember - it can be any shade of red, wheat, grizzle or black and tan... but there should be no white markings!

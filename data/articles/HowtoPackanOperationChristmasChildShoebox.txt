 Print off an Operation Christmas Child label, and mark what age the box is for.
 Remember to wrap the lid separately! Tape your label to the end of the box., Try to put in one of each of the following items: a soft toy, something to wear, school supplies, a personal hygiene item, something to play with, and one other appropriate object of your choice. You can put in small toys, like small dolls or matchbox cars, non-liquid hygiene items, like a hairbrush and soap (in a case), school supplies, like a notebook and pencils, and clothes, like shirts and shoes. Remember to pack age appropriate items! (Different countries have different regulations as to what can't go into a box, so check your country's branch of Operation Christmas Child before making your final selections).

Optionally, you can include $7 to cover shipping and handling costs.

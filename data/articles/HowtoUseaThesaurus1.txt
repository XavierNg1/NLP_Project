 A dictionary style thesaurus has an alphabetical list of words, like a dictionary, with a short list of synonyms for each one. A more traditional layout has an index that will send you to a longer, numbered entry.


In a dictionary thesaurus, you'll find the words alphabetically in the main body of the book, followed immediately by a list of synonyms. Some terms (in the photo, the ones in SMALL CAPS) may be cross references. If you want one of these senses, look up those entries, instead.


 


In a traditional format, use the alphabetical index at the back. That will lead you to a number.





The number takes you to the entry. The reason for this extra step is to allow longer, more detailed entries. Rather than list a small selection of synonyms for each term, with a lot of duplication, there is an index to longer, numbered entries. All the words in the entry will appear in the index just once.
 Make certain that you know what the word means and whether it suits your purposes before you use it. For instance, the entry for "intention" contains both "goal" and "raison d'Ãªtre". Though they are both valid synonyms, they have different meanings and connotations. If you don't know that the French phrase refers to a reason for being rather than a short-term objective, consult a dictionary to find out, or select a different term.

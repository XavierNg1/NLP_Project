A new screen will show all the glyphs that can currently be applied to your weapon., Scroll through your glyphs until you find the one you want to use. When you find the glyph you want to enchant your weapon with, hit the A button. This will enchant your weapon.

Enjoy using your newly enchanted weapon when you are playing ESO. Note that you can only add one enchant to a weapon.

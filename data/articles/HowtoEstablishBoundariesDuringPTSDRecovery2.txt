 Avoid blaming yourself for your PTSD. Be patient with yourself as you heal, and don’t try to rush yourself through the recovery process. Prioritize your own well-being, even if that means avoiding certain places and situations for a while.For example, if a certain date or season aggravates your PTSD symptoms, give yourself plenty of downtime and avoid scheduling demanding events during that time.
Make sure to work with your therapist on a plan for how to handle self-loathing. This may include acknowledging and honoring your thoughts, and then redirecting them to be kinder to yourself.
 Anxious or irrational thoughts can feel very real, even if they’re not true. Instead of letting your fears run away with you, focus on facts. When you start to worry or engage in negative self-talk, ask yourself, “Is that really true?”For instance, if you’re worried you’ll never be able to recover from PTSD, take a mental step back and remind yourself that many people do make a full recovery with enough time and therapy.
You can also check in with a friend or family member to help you determine if your thoughts are realistic.
 Commit to caring for yourself as well as you can, even if you don’t always feel like it. Eat well, exercise regularly, get enough sleep, and make some time to relax every day.Keep track of these activities in a personal calendar to ensure that you make time for them.

Rhythmic cardiovascular exercise, like running or biking, is an effective way to ease PTSD symptoms.
Meditation is a good way to relax when you’re feeling stressed. Other healthy relaxation strategies include writing in a journal and doing visualization exercises.
Don’t let yourself self-medicate with drugs or alcohol. These substances can cut you off from your feelings, making it much more difficult to heal from PTSD. They also carry a high risk of addiction.

 Some parenting groups and infant health websites or clubs offer a wide variety of special offers, discounts, free samples, and promotions for a variety of infant products, including baby formula.


General discount lists are particularly useful if you also want discounts on other infant items or if you're comfortable switching your baby’s formula occasionally.
 Collect coupons from magazines, the newspaper, and special interest publications, as well as the Internet, to get the biggest discounts possible on infant formula.


Let friends and family know that you would love coupons or vouchers for free or discounted infant formula if they happen to come across them.
 Some websites allow networking of parents and community members who list items like baby clothes and unused formula packages as “free for pick-up” if they no longer need them.


If you sign up for a local freebie program, always be careful when visiting strangers’ homes, and check the infant formula package for expiration dates and signs of opening or contamination. Only use sealed, fresh packages of infant formula.

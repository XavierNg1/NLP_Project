 The charge may not be working due to incorrect use of the power adapter. Then check out the overall performance of the battery pack by depleting it entirely ahead of charging it once again is a great way of extending the battery power life. If you realized that the battery pack isn't charging, make sure that the energy outlet is live/operational prior to doing a more significant investigation.;

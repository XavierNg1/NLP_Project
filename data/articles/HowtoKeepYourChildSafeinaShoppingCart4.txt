 Before you place your child in the child seat, take a moment to use a disinfectant wipe on the handle. You may also choose to wipe off the seat, too. Your child will place their hands on the handle, and those hands will automatically go in their mouths. Whatever germs are on the handle will be transferred to your child.Many supermarkets provide disinfectant wipes for you to use. If not, carry your own in your purse or baby bag.
Studies have found that bacteria, including E. Coli and salmonella, can live on shopping cart handles.
 If you want to add extra protection for your child, consider placing something over the handle. This may be a blanket or specific cart seat covering that acts as a barrier between your child and the handle. Seat covers also cover the edges of the cart, which also have germs.This can help keep your childâ€™s hands away from the handle. It also helps reduce the risk that your child will place their mouth on the handle.
 After you take your child out of the shopping cart seat, wash their hands. This helps remove any germs they may have picked up from touching the cart. If you are unable to wash their hands immediately, use hand sanitizer or wipes on their hands before driving away.

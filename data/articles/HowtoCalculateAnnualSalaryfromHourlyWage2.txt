  If you work more than 40 hours per week, you must be paid overtime.  This means you earn one and a half times you regular pay for any hours over 40 hours per week.  If you want to figure out how overtime affects your annual salary, keep track of your overtime and regular hours for at least a month.  Figure out the average number of regular and overtime hours you work and multiply to get the total for the year.  Add these two amounts together to get your total annual salary.If in a four week period, you worked 50 hours, 45 hours, 42 hours and 47 hours, and anything over 40 hours is overtime, then your weekly overtime is 10 hours, 5 hours, 2 hours and 7 hours.  Your average weekly overtime hours are (10+5+2+7)/4=6{\displaystyle (10+5+2+7)/4=6}.      

 If you earn $20 per hour, then your overtime rate is $20∗1.5=$30{\displaystyle \$20*1.5=\$30}

 Your average regular weekly salary is $20∗40=$800{\displaystyle \$20*40=\$800}.  Your average weekly overtime pay is $30∗6=$180{\displaystyle \$30*6=\$180}.  Your total weekly salary is $800+$180=$980{\displaystyle \$800+\$180=\$980}.  

 Your annual salary is $980∗52=$50,960{\displaystyle \$980*52=\$50,960}.
  If you get paid for vacation time or when you’re out sick, then you don’t need to make any changes to your annual salary.  But if your employer doesn’t pay you when you’re out on vacation or sick, then this in effect changes the number of weeks you get paid in a year.  If you take two weeks of vacation each year, then you work only 50 weeks per year instead of 52.  You need to use 50 weeks to calculate your annual salary instead of 52.
  Some companies pay bonuses at different times of the year.  These are added to your regular salary.  For example, your employer may give holiday bonuses, sign-on bonuses to new employees or rewards for meeting goals.  Also, sales commissions count as bonuses.  If you earn bonuses, add them to your total when calculating your annual salary.For example, suppose you earn an annual salary of $50,000 before bonuses, and your boss wants to give you a 2.5 percent holiday bonus.  The amount of the bonus is $50,000∗025=$1,250{\displaystyle \$50,000*025=\$1,250}.

 In this case, your total annual salary is $50,000+$1,250=$51,250{\displaystyle \$50,000+\$1,250=\$51,250}.

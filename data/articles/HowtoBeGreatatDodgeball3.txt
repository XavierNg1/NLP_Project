 Catching is the underappreciated skill that wins dodgeball games. Remember that catching balls knocks people out just like throwing them. It’s actually better, because now you have another ball to throw and another teammate on your side! Always be prepared to take advantage of this part of the game., Even though you should always be on the lookout for balls you can catch, don’t catch balls that you think you might drop. You drop it, you’re out. If you’d have to reach for the ball even a little bit, let it go., Balls that you can catch with both hands are the golden ones. This means that they’re coming right at you. You’ll also be much more likely to keep control of balls that you can catch with both hands, rather than diving for one that you’d barely pull in with your fingertips.Be sure to catch balls with your whole hand, taking the brunt of the catch on your palms. Fingertip catches are much harder to maintain without dropping them.
 Once you’ve got the ball in your hands, bring it into your chest. You may be able to catch some balls with your whole body, and that’s even better. Cradle it there until you’re sure you’ve got control. This will help you avoid dropping it., Yay, you caught the ball! Now get moving again. Don’t celebrate, as this is the moment when you’ll find yourself targeted. Immediately after you have control of the ball, get back in the game and be ready to dodge and throw again., Stalling occurs when the referee decides that a player is trying to delay the game. Generally, you should be doing something with a ball after having it your hands for a few seconds. This could include blocking, rolling the ball back to the other team, or throwing it. After ten seconds, the ref can call on you for stalling and send you out of the game.

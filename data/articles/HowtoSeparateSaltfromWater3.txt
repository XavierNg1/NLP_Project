 The methods above aren't the only ways to separate salt from water, they're just the most convenient for most people working at home. It's also possible to separate salt from water with other methods requiring specialized materials. For instance, a technique called reverse osmosis can remove salt from salt water by forcing the water through a permeable membrane. This membrane acts as a filter, permitting only water molecules to pass through and keeping dissolved contaminants (like salt) out.Reverse osmosis pumps are sometimes sold for residential use but are also often used for recreational purposes like camping. Pumps can be somewhat expensive, usually running several hundred dollars., Another way to separate salt and water is via chemical reaction. For instance, research has shown that treating salt water with a chemical called decanoic acid is a reliable way to remove the salt.After adding the acid and heating slightly, then cooling, the salt and other impurities "fall out" of the solution (that is, solidify and sink to the bottom). When the reaction is complete, the water and salt sit in two completely separate layers, making it easy to remove the water.


Decanoic acid is available from chemical supply stores â€” usually around $30-$40 per bottle.
 Using the power of electricity, it's possible to remove particles like salt from water. This is done by submerging a negatively charged anode and a positively charged cathode in water and separating them with a porous membrane. The electrical charge of the anode and cathode essentially "pull" dissolved ions (like those that make up salt) toward them like magnets, leaving relatively pure water.Note that this process does not necessarily remove bacteria or other contaminants from the water, so further treatment may be needed to get drinkable water from this method in the wild. Recent research has been promising, however, suggesting new techniques that do kill bacteria as part of the process.

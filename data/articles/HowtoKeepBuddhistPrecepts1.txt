 You might find that they are put in ways relevant from ordinary people up to more committed Buddhists.


Consider the extremes of each one. Buddhism is a "middle path" focus recommending to avoid extremes as they don't lead to a peaceful life. The first extreme is becoming obsessed by the rules or fretting over them. Its impossible (as per the first precept below) to walk around without squashing microbes, insects that you don't see underground etc. Its all about intention not to kill so if you find a spider inside, the option would always be to leave it alone, or gently scoop it in a glass and let it go outside.
The other extreme is trying to force or belittle other people who don't follow these "rules". There is a great danger (particularly on volatile subjects such as sectarianism, vegetarianism etc) for people to start aggressively pushing their views and essentially trying to get the other person to surrender their own, which is to the detriment of both people. It should be asked whether this is really what Buddhism and the path of letting go of stress is all about. Do what is skillful and abandon what is unskillful is perhaps the best guideline of all.
 The reason is, virtue or goodness is the key foundation behind the noble eightfold path. When you consider virtue (sila), mental development and training (samadhi) and wisdom (panna or prajna), virtue underlines them all. Without virtue, the mind will not settle or be flexible enough to work with to develop the mind. Without virtue, wisdom cannot be practiced or developed. The flipside is wisdom is needed to be naturally virtuous and mental development is needed to train the mind to not run off into unskillful actions. The balancing ended reason is that virtue promotes wellbeing as we are safer and feel safer with ourselves and others. Virtue is the starting block as letting go of harmful intentions is itself virtue, mental skills and wisdom.

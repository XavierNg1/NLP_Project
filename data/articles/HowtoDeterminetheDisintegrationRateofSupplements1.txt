 Over the counter supplements are not regulated as drugs but many companies still use the same methods of testing for disintegration rate. If the company has used the USP standards and testing, they will usually label it so consumers will know.;
, Supplements come in many different forms. It is important to know which form you are taking to determine disintegration rate.


Standard form usually dissolves within 30 to 45 minutes after ingestion. A standard form would be a tablet that is not coated with gelatin or a gel pill. They can usually be crushed into a dry powder.
Enteric coated dissolves once the supplement has reached the intestine.
Gel coated usually dissolves within 30 minutes after ingestion.
Time release supplements will have the amount of time it takes for the supplement to fully absorb into the body on the label. These will vary based on supplement.
Chewable tablets must be chewed or crushed in order to disintegrate fully.

 In time, old caulking dries up, shrinks, and cracks to create air leaks. Removing old caulking around your windows and replacing it with new, weather-resistant caulking can help stop some of those leaks.You can buy caulk stripping tools as well as easy to apply, weather resistant caulking from your local home improvement store.
Always remove old caulking whenever possible before applying a new caulk.
After youâ€™ve piped the new caulking around your window, be sure to use a smoothing tool to flatten the new caulk and distribute it evenly across your window frame. This helps better block air leaks.
 If you notice a gap between the bottom of your exterior doors and their frames, use door sweeps to seal their leaks. Door sweeps can be found online or at most home improvement and hardware stores.Most door sweeps are easy to install. Simply slide them on from the side underneath the base of your door and then screw on.
You may want to use them on interior doors, too, if you notice that cold air tends to travel rapidly from one room to another.
 Add extra insulation in your attic to prevent heat from escaping through the ceiling. Check the insulation in the attic and look for areas that are stained dark. The dark areas are created by dirt and dust and will show you the spots where air is leaking through. Replace or add insulation in those areas.If you plan on doing this project yourself, lay fiberglass rolls, and use metal mesh to create barriers around areas that need to be exposed such as vents.
Remember to wear protective gear such as goggles, gloves, and a mask when installing insulation.

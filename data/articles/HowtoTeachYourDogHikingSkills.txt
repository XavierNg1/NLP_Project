 If your dog will be off-leash in the woods, he should come when called, every time (or close to it). Practice off-leash with your dog at home, then in a yard, then in a dog park where your dog can roam off-leash.


Choose a calling word. It doesn't have to be his name, and it probably shouldn't be if you (or anyone in the house) has ever used his name to scold him. Some people use a whistle instead of a calling word.
Reward your dog every time he looks at you or comes to you. The reward doesn't have to be a treat, though if you have low-calorie, high-value treats, it's always a good default. If your dog loves playing tug or fetch, reward him with that.
Never call a dog to you so you can punish him or put a leash on him. Lure him with something else, like a toy, or chase him if you have to, but just make sure that you avoid any chance for him to associate coming to you when called with being punished (or anything negative, for that matter). Responding to your call should be something he loves to do because good things happen every time he does it.;
, If the dog is chewing on something he shouldn't, or is about to roll around in poop, it's useful to be able to tell him to stop (and have him listen to you).
 This isn't so much a skill, but is developed in the same way. Before taking your dog on a 10 mile (16Â km) hike, take him one several smaller hikes once or twice a week, gradually adding distance. His paws will need time to toughen and his heart and lungs will need a bit of preparation as well.

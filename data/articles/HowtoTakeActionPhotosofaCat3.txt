 Cats can be difficult to photograph because they are quite independent and will not always pose for a photo. As a result, you should have your camera charged and ready to use at all times. You never know when you will see your cat in a unique position, like chasing a leaf or playing with toys.Having your camera ready and accessible will make it easier for you to capture candid photos of a cat.
 It will take time to capture the perfect action photo of your cat, and as a result you need to be patient. Your cat may not immediately respond the way you want. Do not force them to move to a certain spot. Instead, you may have to wait until they are ready. It could take a number of photo sessions to get the exact image you want., Sometimes cats will sleep on top of cupboards or under the bed. It can be difficult to take pictures in these hard-to-reach locations. Try using a camera extender. This works the best with small point-and-shoot cameras or cell phone cameras. Simply attach the camera to the extender and then position the camera so that you can see the cat., Sometimes the best action shots are unplanned. For example, two cats may be playing with each other and you happen to see them. In order to take candid photos, it is best if you are quiet and the cat is unaware of your presence. Avoid making sudden movements so that you do not distract or scare the cat., You can also capture candid shots by remaining far away from the cat and then using the zoom on your camera lens to get a close up shot. This way you will not distract the cat and can still set up a shot of the cat in motion.

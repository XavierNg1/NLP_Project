 Done properly, both of these types of combatives are gross motor weapons, and do not endanger the small bones in the wrist.
 Keep your wrist straight while you do this. Do not roll your wrist up or down - you should have a perfect line from your lead two knuckles to your shoulder.
 Feel them out. Maybe they've been doing this a while are are pretty good, or maybe they're brand new and don't quite know how to hold a pad or take a hit.
 They can be quite annoying when working on plucks, chokes, and weapon take aways, but when punching they will help keep you from rolling your wrist. Once you get the hang of punching correctly, you probably will not need these any longer.
 This involves violently folding the attacker's wrist down over itself (towards the under-side of the arm towards the elbow). It is meant to break the attacker's wrist, so go slowly and don't injure your training partner's wrist.
 In Krav Maga, it is important to be able to fight equally well with either your right hand or left. If you have a hurt hand, make it your power side and go easy with it. If punching hurts, do heel palms instead or vice-versa.

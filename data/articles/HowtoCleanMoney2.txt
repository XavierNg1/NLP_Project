 Run some warm water into a sink or shallow basin. Add a small amount of mild liquid soap to the water and make sure it’s evenly distributed to form a soapy solution. For the purpose of cleaning circulating currency that changes hands often, most standard dish or hand soaps will work.Mild soaps are preferable if you’re a collector or wish to preserve the condition of the coin. Most detergents contain abrasive elements that can wear away a coin’s detailing.
 Place the dirty coins into the soapy water solution. Allow them to soak anywhere from ten minutes to half an hour, depending on how soiled they are. The warm water will loosen the caked-on dirt and grime, while the soap will kill bacteria and eat away at stains.You will be able to observe the water darken as the dirt soaks out of the coins. Yuck!
Use a sponge, scrubber or cue tip to lightly scour the outer surface of the coins after they’ve had a chance to soak for a while. Be sure to throw the scrubber away after using it to clean coins.
 Once the coins have had ample time to soak, drain the dirty water from the sink or basin. Then, transfer the coins to a kitchen strainer to rinse them, or simply hold them up to the faucet by hand. Run cool water over both faces of the coins until all traces of soap have been rinsed away.Failure to rinse the coins sufficiently can cause them to retain a thin coating of soap that dirt and grime can later stick to.
 Lay out an absorbent towel and place the coins on top. Pat the coins with one end of the towel to remove excess water, then let them air dry. In roughly ten minutes, the coins will be clean, dry and ready to be handled without worry.Don’t allow water to stand on coins that have been washed and rinsed. The moisture can damage or discolor the metal, or even cause it to tarnish.

 Keep a wad of castor-oil-soaked paper towel near sinks (placed in small cup or dish).;
, After having done the dishes or having washed your hands, stick fingertips into the wad and then gently massage and spread the oil using just fingertips. Pay close attention to areas already cracked.
 If after using the oil you find yourself with too much oil on your fingertips, spread the excess over the rest of your hands but don't skip the fingertips part.
 It's best to air-dry if at all possible, but the technique will work even with drying!

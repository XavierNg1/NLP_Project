 Go on the Internet. Read a book. This will also help stay away from having to do chores on your period.
 If you have to eat sugary, fatty foods, try to eat as little of it as possible. Processed foods make your period worse. Hopefully, you usually eat healthily, so you don't have to worry about looking suspicious.
 Let's face it, if you barely go to the bathroom, yet have to go to the bathroom every 3 hours to change your pads, then it will make your parents suspicious. Try changing your pads in your bedroom by sneaking a toilet paper roll in your room.

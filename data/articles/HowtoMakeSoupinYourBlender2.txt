 A cold cucumber and avocado soup can get you healthy vitamins from fruits and vegetables. It is also easy to store and serve, as you don't have to worry about reheating it. Before you make your chilled soup, prepare your ingredients.You will need 2 large cucumbers. You should peel and dice them before adding them to your soup.
Chop up two scallions, including the green and white portions.
Scoop out the insides of a large avocado and discard the skin.
 Add the cucumbers, avocado, and scallions to a blender. You should also add two tablespoons of lime juice, 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper., How long this will take depends on the speed of your blender. Keep blending the ingredients until they have a smooth, soup-like quality.If your blender runs on a very high setting, you may want to use a lower or middle setting instead of a high setting. While the high setting will blend ingredients faster, it may make your soup hotter than you want due to the friction.
 You do not have to wait before serving chilled soup. It can be served as soon as it comes out of the blender. It can make a great snack, a side dish, or can be a meal in itself.If you have soup leftover, store it in the refrigerator for later. One advantage of chilled soup is that it does not need to be reheated after storage.

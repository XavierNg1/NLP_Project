 One of the most effective ways to control an ant problem on peonies is to spray the plants with an insecticide. Before choosing a product to spray, make sure that the manufacturer specifically states that the product is effective against ants. Apply the insecticide according to the manufacturer's directions.


This method will not generally be acceptable if you are committed to gardening organically or do not want to harm the beneficial insects that aid the plants in pollination.;
, If you are only concerned about the presence of ants because you want to cut the flowers and display them indoors, a water bath is a simple and effective method. Cut the peonies with long stems so that you have ample room to handle them, and then dip the flowers into a bowl of water. This will remove nearly all of the ants.


For even more effective removal of the ants, you can add a few drops of dish soap to the water. A mild soapy solution will not harm the flowers.
 If keeping the ants off the peonies at all times is your goal, you can make a simple ant trap using paper and petroleum jelly.


Begin by cutting a circle with about a 6 inch (15 cm) diameter out of a piece of paper. Make a straight cut from the outer edge to the center of the circle, and then cut out a small circle at the center of the paper circle.
Smear one side of the paper circle with petroleum jelly. Then, place the circle around the stem of your peony plant, with the plant's stem at the center of the circle. If the petroleum jelly side is facing up, any ants trying to climb the plant will get stuck in the petroleum jelly.
 Another way you can discourage ants from getting on your peonies is by planting ant-repellant plants nearby. Some common plants that tend to repel ants are geraniums, mint, garlic, and calendula.

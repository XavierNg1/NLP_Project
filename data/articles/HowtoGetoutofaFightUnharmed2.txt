 While the number of people you're up against will affect your ability to escape from a fight without injury, your first instinct should be to escape whenever possible. If necessary, shove, disable, or distract your attacker in some way and run for it.Potential distracting or disabling maneuvers you might need to utilize include punching your opponent in the nose, shoving them away, or delivering a swift kick to the groin (if facing a male aggressor).
 The fence is a maneuver that both demonstrates a disinterest in fighting and prepares you to defend yourself if necessary. Show the hostile party your hands with the palms facing outward and fingers pointed up.At the same time, take a deep breath and breathe out slowly to help you relax.
You could also reiterate your unwillingness to fight by saying, “I do not wish to fight. Let’s go about our business.”

, If you’re in an area with security or police, get their attention so they can diffuse the situation. At the very least, attract the attention of passers-by so they can intervene on your behalf. Sometimes an aggressor can be dissuaded from pursuing the fight simply by having another set of eyes on them.When getting help from others, usually a simple "Help me!" will suffice. You might also try, “Over here!” or “Police!”

 It will be located on the bottom or back of the router, typically next to a "password" or "network/security key" heading., You'll be prompted to enter the router's network key, after which point you will likely have the option of changing the password.

If hard-resetting your router doesn't solve your router's problems, you'll need to call the router's customer support hotline for help in diagnosing and fixing the problem.

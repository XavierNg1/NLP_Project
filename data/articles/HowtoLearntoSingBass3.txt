 When you are singing bass your knees and hips should be neither locked nor bent. Instead, they should be loose and relaxed. Your pelvis should be positioned over your feet. This positioning will help to optimize your vocal abilities., You also want to make sure that your head is in the right position for singing. Your chin should be parallel to the floor and your ears should be directly over your shoulders. Many people have a tendency to hold their head too far forward. This can create pressure in your throat that will impact the quality of your voice.In most cases improper head positioning is a result of an overly arched back.
 In order to sing bass, you need to learn how to breathe properly from your diaphragm. Try lying on your back and resting your hands on your waist with your fingers pointing towards your belly button. Then, fill up your stomach with air by taking a slow and deep breath. You should be able to feel your hands rise and fall with each deep breath.Breath in and then exhale while counting to five. Do this ten times, making sure that your hands rise and fall with each breath.
Repeat the exercise twice daily.
 One common problem for bass singers is over breathing. By taking too much air a singer is forced to use their tongue to cap their breath causing pressure. Instead, you should take small breaths while singing and release the breath slowly.

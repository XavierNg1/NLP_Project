 You will need to have your peel-and-stick tiles prepared, a tile cutter or utility knife, and level. Pretty basic, huh? If you tiles are not stuck together on sheets, you may also need spacers to make sure they are all evenly spread.
 The sticky backings of your tiles can’t adhere to walls if they are dusty or greasy. Use a damp rag to completely wipe down walls, and then let them dry completely.
 It is important to make sure you get a good measurement so you know exactly what size you should cut your tiles.


Choose a stopping point, either directly below your cabinets or at an arbitrary point on the wall.
Make sure that you have enough tiles to fill the measured space, as well as a few extras for precaution.
Use a level and straight edge to mark your stopping point along the wall.
 Peel the backing off the tiles, and stick them to your desired location. Always start from the bottom center of the wall and work your way out.


Firmly press the tiles each time you stick them to the wall, to make sure they are firmly adhered.
Hold a straight edge or level to the sides of your tile as your press, to make sure that they don’t shift out of alignment.
 Work your way across the wall, until the entirety of your desired space is filled up. Cut any pieces to fit outlet holes or edges and corners before you attach them to the wall., To keep it looking its best, wipe the backsplash clean with water or a generic kitchen cleaner occasionally.

 Box nets provide more space for you to move around in your bed without touching the walls of the net and getting stung through the net. However, unlike wedge and bell nets, box nets require four attachment points—one for each corner of the net. Look for hooks, pins, or fixtures on the ceiling.If you can’t find a spot over the head of your bed to attach the net, consider moving the bed to a more suitable spot.
An overhead beam will work at an attachment point.
If there are no good spots available, you can screw a hook into the ceiling or use a strong adhesive hook.
 Remove and net and any strings or rope from the bag. Drape the net over your bed and match up the corners with the four corners of your bed., Locate the part of the net that attaches to the ceiling. There will be four loops on the top part of the box—this is the part that attaches to the ceiling.Wrap a rope or string through the loops on your net and tie it to the anchors on the ceiling.
If the anchor is a beam you should wrap the rope around the beam several times and then tie the end securely.
 Drape the corners of the net around your bed and tuck them under your mattress. Make sure that you get every inch of the net tucked in.If there isn’t enough fabric to tuck under the mattress, you may need to lower the top of the net that is attached to the ceiling. You can do this by letting out slack on the rope or string you used to attach the net.

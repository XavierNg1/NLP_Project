 Place it in a saucepan and heat it until it begins to steam, but does not come to a boil. Remove the milk from heat.
 Pour the lemon juice into the warm milk and stir it slowly for several minutes.
 Cover the saucepan with a dishcloth and let the curds separate from the whey for about an hour.
 Place a piece of cheesecloth over a bowl and pour the curds and whey into the cheesecloth. Let the curds drain for about 5 minutes.
 Gather the ends of the cheesecloth and hold it under cool water to rinse the curds. Continue until they are completely cooled, then squeeze the cloth to get the curds as dry as possible.
 Place the curds in a bowl and add the salt and cream or half and half.

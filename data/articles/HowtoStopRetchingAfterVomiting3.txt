 If your doctor has recommended an anti-nausea, antacid, or anti-anxiety medication, take it daily or at the first sign of nausea according to their instructions. If you find that your medication is ineffective, ask your doctor or pharmacist to modify your treatment regimen.It might take some time to tailor your treatment plan to combat symptoms of chronic conditions, like cyclic vomiting syndrome or migraine-related episodes.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist to recommend an alternative medication if you experience any side effects, such as diarrhea, headache, dizziness, or drowsiness.
 To stay hydrated, youâ€™ll need at least six to eight daily glasses of liquid. However, drinking during meals can upset your sensitive stomach.

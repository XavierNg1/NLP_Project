 It can hurt to feel sad, so it's normal to want to switch off the sadness and feel happiness again. Usually this is easier said than done, but sometimes you just need a change in perspective. If you're in a mental rut, and you feel ready to open the curtains and let in some sunlight, try different techniques to help you stop being sad.
 When you feel sad about a particular event or problem, it's hard to just make the feeling go away. Once you've given yourself time to fully experience the sadness, the load should start to lighten. You can help the sadness recede more quickly by staying healthy, talking it out, and using other methods that help you stop feeling sad. When the sadness is ready to go away, it will.
 Sometimes, no matter what you try, you can't stop feeling sad. Distracting yourself or trying to escape from the feeling will only set you further back. If you've been sad for awhile and you don't know why, or if your sadness seems to be stuck, talk to someone who can help. Even though there probably won't be a quick fix, working through your sadness with a therapist trained to help will be the best way to overcome it in the long run.

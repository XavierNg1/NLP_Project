 Another option is to use water to flush out the object in your child’s ear. Get a bulb syringe made for ears and a bowl of warm water. The bulb syringe will allow you to insert water into your child’s ear safely.You can find bulb ear syringes at your local drugstore or online.
 Fill the bulb syringe with warm water. Then, tilt your child’s head in your lap with the damaged ear facing upward. Insert the syringe into your child’s ear and press down on the plunger to release the water. Then, turn your child’s head downward so the water and the object can slide out of their ear.You may have to flush your child’s ear a few times to dislodge the item. If you have flushed their ear several times and the item does not come out, seek professional medical care.
 If there is an insect stuck in your child’s ear, you can use baby oil or mineral to try to float it out. Heat the oil so it is warm, but not hot.Do not use the oil to remove any other objects besides an insect.
If there is any pain, bleeding, or discharge from the ear, do not apply the oil. Seek professional medical care instead.
 Tilt your child’s head so the affected ear is facing upward. Pour the oil slowly into your child’s ear. Pull their earlobe back and downward to help ease the oil into the ear.The insect should then suffocate and float out of your child’s ear with the help of the oil.

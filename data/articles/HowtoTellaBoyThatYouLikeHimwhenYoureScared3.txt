 Bring your diary to school, and have it open and hold it while you're talking (Make sure there aren't many people around.


You don't want someone else to read your diary. Like when you're doing an assignment where you have to have a partner). Don't make it look like your reading or writing in it, because he might think you're not interested in what he has to say. Then, say you have to go to the bathroom, and leave your diary open in front of him (Make sure it's on a page that's about you liking him)

 Most airlines restrict total bag size to 45 inches (114.3Â cm). This is the sum of the height, width and length of the bag. Keep in mind that when you place items in pockets and stuff the bag full, the size might exceed that limitation in bags that meet the restriction without being fully packed.;
, A bag that has many pockets allows you to stow away many smaller items that might get lost inside a bag with no pockets. These pockets should be zippered, especially if they are on the outside. Outside pockets are good for items you wish to easily access in the airport or on the plane.
 A neatly folded change of clothes should fit into your bag.
 The shoulder strap should be comfortable for carrying purposes. The bag should also include a handle to grasp with your hand like a duffel bag.
 Your carry-on bag should hook onto or attach to your larger, wheeled bag for easier transportation to and in the airport.
 For instance, if your other luggage is soft-sided, the carry-on bag should be, too. Or, if you have hard-sided luggage, look for a similar carry-on. Purchase a carry-on bag that either matches or complements that colors or patterns of your other luggage.
, In the case that your bag is lost, the person finding it will be able to contact you.

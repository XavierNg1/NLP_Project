 In a large mixing bowl, crack your eggs open and beat them together. Add your dandelions. Stir them in so that each one is covered in egg., Break out a second mixing bowl. Add your flour, seasoned salt, and ground pepper. Stir until they are evenly mixed., Take them out of the egg, a few at a time. As you do, hold them over the bowl so the excess egg can drain back into it. From there, transfer them to your bowl of dry ingredients and toss them around until they’re evenly coated. Then gently toss them from hand to hand over the bowl to shake off any extra flour before placing them on a plate.If desired, pour your egg into an airtight container and refrigerate for future use in the next day or two.
 Set a large skillet on your stovetop, turn the burner to medium heat, and add your butter. Once that melts, fill the skillet with your floured dandelions. Cook them for about five minutes, or until they turn golden brown. While they cook, line a clean plate with paper towels. Once they’re done, transfer them to your plate so the paper towels can soak up some of the butter before serving.

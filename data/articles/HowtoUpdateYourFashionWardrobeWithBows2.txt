 This is one of the easiest ways to incorporate a bow into your look, and the added dimension helps break up your torso. Avoid this look if you have wide hips, however, since a large bow at your hips may add unwanted volume.
 Stick with a smaller bow to avoid adding too much bulk to your hips. This option works best if you have a tucked-in shirt, making the bow on your skirt visible.
 Tie the ribbon into a large bow at the front or side, depending on what position suits your tastes best. This is a cute, simple alternative to a standard belt.
 The maturity of the heel nicely offsets the girlishness of the bow, preventing your look from becoming too childish.
 This is another way to introduce bows into your ensemble without overwhelming your look.
 Make sure you choose a simple pair of shoes that are still in fair condition.

 This water gun is made by converting a sports ball air pump into a water gun. These are the small air pumps that are used to refill the air in basketballs, soccer balls, and footballs. To make it, you will need a hand operated sports ball air pump, plumbers tape, a drill, and a pair of scissors.You may also be able to use a small hand operated bicycle tire pump as well if you want a slightly larger gun.
 Take the air pump and remove the nozzle at the end, putting it aside. Find a drill bit that fits into the hole in the top of the pump. Take the drill and drill through the metal area on the inside of the pump. Make sure you don't strip the sides of the hole. The nozzle needs to be able to screw back in there.


Make sure the handle lever is pulled out. You don't want to accidentally puncture that part of the pump.
 The nozzle of the air pump should have multiple holes along the needle and one on the end. Using a long piece of the plumbers tape, cover up all the holes except the one at the end of the needle. You want to make sure you wrap it around the area where the hole is as well as the surrounding areas. You don't want any water to leak out of those areas once you start shooting your gun.If you want, you can paint the outside of the pump in a fun color or in a cool design. Using outdoor spray paint or some other waterproof paint, paint the pump and let it dry before you assemble it.
 Take the pump and stick it in water with the lever all the way in. Once the end is submerged in water, pull back the lever to fill the pump with water. Next, screw the nozzle back on the gun. To release the water, just push in the pump lever.

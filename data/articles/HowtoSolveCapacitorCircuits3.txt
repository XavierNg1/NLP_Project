 A parallel circuit has more than one loop and all are connected to same voltage. The capacitors in the circuit are arrange in parallel to each other. 
, The sum of all the capacitance value in a parallel circuit equals to the total capacitance in the circuit. This is given by the equation CT=C1+C2+C3. .

For example: A parallel circuit has three capacitors of value: C1 = 2F, C2 = 3F, C3 = 6F. Then the total capacitance, CT is 2+3+6 = 11 F.
 The total charge in a circuit depends on the total voltage and the total capacitance in a circuit. This relationship is given by the equation Q=CV{\displaystyle Q=CV}. 

For example: The circuit has a total capacitance of 11 F and total voltage of 10 V. Plug in the givens to the equation: Q = 11*10 = 110 C.
 In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each capacitor is the same and equal to the total voltage in the circuit. 

For example: The total voltage in the circuit is 10 V. Then the voltage across V1 is 10 V, V2 is 10 V and V3 is 10 V. 


, Once the voltage is identified for each capacitor with a known capacitance value, the charge in each capacitor can be found using the equation Q=CV{\displaystyle Q=CV}. 

For example: The voltage across all the capacitors is 10V and the capacitance value are 2F, 3F and 6F respectively.

Charge in first capacitor is Q1 = C1*V1 = 2*10 = 20 C.

Charge in first capacitor is Q2 = C2*V2 = 3*10 = 30 C.

Charge in first capacitor is Q3 = C3*V3 = 6*10 = 60 C.
 Once the voltage and charge in each capacitor is calculated, the circuit is solved. Label these information in the circuit drawing to keep everything organized.

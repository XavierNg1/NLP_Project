 You can use a 14-oz soup can size, medium 28-oz size or a large 48-oz size.;
, Trace a circle in the middle. This determines the size of the hat brim.
 Using a paintbrush, dab a bit of glue on each cotton ball and begin covering the sides of the can.
 Crumple newspaper (or any other kind of paper or paper towels) into a ball and cover with a fresh sheet of paper, taping the bottom. It doesn't matter if it isn't perfectly round.
 Put a large amount of glue on the bottom of the head and place on the bottom of the can. The opened part will sit on a table and the head sits on the unopened part of the can. Fill in around the head with cotton balls.
 Cut out small circles from felt for eyes and nose and a smiling mouth from black or red felt and glue onto the head.
 Glue around the snowman's head for a scarf. or you can use a thick red yarn

, Cut a circular piece from your bristle board outside the circle you drew. This will be the hat brim and it should be 2-4" wide depending on your can size. Then cut out the middle circle. (the easiest way to do this is to punch a hole in the middle of the circle and cut outward to the edge and then cut around). Cut a rectangular piece of bristle board about 3-4" wide and long enough to go around the inner circle of the brim leaving a little extra. (See picture #9 below)

, Glue the two ends of the rectangular piece together and set inside the center hole of the hat leaving about 1/2" sticking out the bottom. Snip around this 1/2" piece and fold over gluing to the bottom of the hat. Dab glue around the inner edge of the hat and set on the snowman's head.
 Cut a circle leaving 1/2" extra, snip around, fold the snipped parts, dab glue on each snip and set inside the top of the rectangular piece so that the snips are glued to the sides of the top hat.
 With a little care, he will last for years.

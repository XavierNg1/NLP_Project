 Grease a pan and set aside. If you don't want to use grease or spray, line the pan with parchment paper.
 Sift the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl. This aerates the flour. Lift the sifter up high to make sure the flour is extremely airy., In a separate mixing bowl, combine the butter and sugar. Creaming butter and sugar is a type of mixing method. Start with room temperature butter. Using an electric mixer, beat the butter on low until it is creamy. Add the sugar, and mix on high.Cream until the color is pale, and the mixture is fluffy. Don't forget to scrape the sides of the bowl while mixing.


To make your butter room temperature, take out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before you begin. Room temperature butter should be soft, but not melted., Gradually beat the eggs into the butter and sugar mixture. Add the vanilla extract. Continue mixing until the batter is thick and voluminous., Sift the flour onto the batter, and using an electric hand whisk, combine the flour and batter for about a minute, until the mixture is smooth and creamy.


If you do not have an electric hand whisk, you can fold in the flour. Cut the spatula into the mixture, and then lift the batter over the top. Turn the bowl a quarter of a turn and repeat. This method gently mixes in the flour without losing the air.
 Bake for 25-30 minutes. Check to see if the cake is done by inserting a toothpick or fork into the middle. If it comes out clean, the cake is done.


If you want to add a layer of fruit, jam, or frosting, divide the recipe into two identical pans to make a layered cake.
 After you remove the cake from the oven, let it stand for a few minutes. Use a knife to loosen the edges of the cake from the sides of the pan. Then, place on a wire rack to cool completely.

 Go to the Google Play Store (for Android users) or to the App Store (for iPhone users), and type “Skype” into the search field. In the results, tap on the app’s icon and you will be taken to the app’s details page. Tap on “Download” or “Install” to install the app to your device.


Downloading Skype is totally free.
 Once the Skype app is done downloading, just tap on its icon to open it.
 Enter your Skype name and your password into the text fields, and tap on “Sign in” to go into your Skype account.
 To do this, look to the top of your phone screen where there should be three options: “Recent,” “Favorites,” and “People.” Tap on the “People” button to load your contact list. Tap on the contact you want to send a photo to; this will open a chat window.
 To do this, with the chat window open, look for the blue plus sign right next to your message box at the bottom of the screen. Tap on this button to make a menu appear, and tap on “Send file” to bring up your photo folder.
 Go through your photos, and pick the one you want to share. Once you select a picture, it will then be uploaded into the chat window.
 Once you’re sure you want to share the picture, simply tap on the blue arrow to the right of the image, and that will effectively add the image to your conversation on Skype mobile.

 Wall jumping on chocolate is the best way to practice your wall-jumping if you are new to the game. By default, it has friction, which means that your mouse will not slide back down while wall-jumping.


The red coloured ground is lava, if you touch it you get thrown in the air with lots of force and speed. It can make your mouse die, but you can stop that by pressing and holding the up key while crossing it.






The purple ground is a trampoline. It's possible to wall-jump it. Instead of jumping away from the wall, just jump, then run towards the wall, then when you bounce away from it, jump again. You will not need to pull away from it because it will bounce you back by itself. Trampoline does not work as well if it is touching wood, though. It's not likely you'll need this, unless you're playing bootcamp.






The light blue ground is ice, which can't be wall jumped unless it is at a slant. Although, you can corner-jump it more easily than any other ground. If you don't get it the first time, keep trying!;
, It's pretty much the same as wood. It's usually pretty easy to wall jump on it.
 Then you should be able to run towards it again to reset your jump. Remember, you have to fall into the wall., Do this by typing /room vanilla *your username here*.

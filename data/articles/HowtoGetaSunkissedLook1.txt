 Bronzer is a fast and easy way to achieve the sun-kissed look. You can buy bronzer at a cosmetics store, like Sephora, or at many supermarkets. Choose a bronzer that works well with your skin tone. For warm skin tones, most of the golden brown shades of bronzer will work. For paler skin tones, look for peach tones of bronzer. To apply, use a makeup brush and lightly apply the bronzer to the apples of your cheeks, hairlines, bridge of your nose, and the tip of your chin.Ask a makeup consultant at the cosmetic store for advice on picking the right bronzer.
Do not use too much bronzer at once or the appearance will look overdone and false.;
, Use eye shadow with your bronzer to add to the sun-kissed look. A golden eye shadow is ideal. Apply it to your eyelids, inner corners, and under the eye. Complete the look with black eyeliner and mascara for a more dramatic appearance.You can also use a yellow, orange, or coral eye shadow.
Use white eyeliner instead of black eyeliner if you want a unique look.
 Choose a nude shade of lipstick to complete your makeup. Use a lighter or darker shade of nude, depending on your skin tone. Apply a clear lipstick to add a dewy look. If you want a more dramatic look, choose a bold red or berry color.Coral is another nice, summery shade of lipstick.
 Adding highlights to your hair is another easy way to look sun-kissed. Blonde highlights are a common choice, but blonde may not look good if your hair is very dark. Choose a color that is a few shades lighter than your current hair color. You can buy a kit to do the highlights yourself at home, but it is better to get your hair done by a professional.You can also use lightening sprays and lemon juice to add highlights to your hair.

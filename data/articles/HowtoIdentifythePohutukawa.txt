 These are the most telling aspect of the pohutukawa. They will be arranged around the tree as fluffy balls, as pictured.;
,, The leaves of the pohutukawa will appear white underneath and feel velvety to the touch. This velvet-like layer is made of many tiny hairs that slow the evaporation of water and protect the stomata from salt water. There will also be white branchlets. The leaves grow opposite one another, in pairs.


The leaves are wax-like and waterproof, and they're often curled under at the edges; this habit allows salty water to run off.






Falling leaves turn the colours of deep reds and yellows.
 This is its most common home but it may also be found some way inland.

 You can buy inexpensive ID making kits online that allow you to print your own ID sized cards and laminate them.


Once you design and print them on the computer, use a pouch laminator to laminate the luggage tag card and use a hole-puncher to punch a clean hole through the card.
Attach the luggage ID card to your luggage using ribbon or string.
Using this method can give your luggage a professional and clean look, or allow you to customize it with digital pictures.
An inexpensive ID printing and lamination kit works well.
 Create these with colored paper, pictures you find online, and other craft supplies. Have them laminated at your local office supply store or print shop.


This is a great project for kids. Encourage them to color with bright markers on one side of the tags.
Print your name and mobile phone number on the opposite side of the tag.
Have several laminated on one sheet and cut them apart with scissors. Leave about 1/2" of laminate around the tag.
Punch a hole at the top of the tag, through the laminate and use a zip tie or a shoestring to attach to your luggage.

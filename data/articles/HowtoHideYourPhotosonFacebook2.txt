 Log into your Facebook account and go to your Timeline (until recently, this was called your Wall) by clicking on your name in the upper right corner.
 Click on “Photos” in the header. You’ll see it below your cover photo and between the “About” and “Friends” links. All the photos that are allowed on your Timeline will appear.
 After clicking on “Photos,” click on “Albums.” A list of your photo albums will appear.
 If you want to hide an album, click the settings icon under it. You will be given several options.


Choose “Only Me” if you want to hide the album completely.
Choose “Friends” if you want only your friends and acquaintances to see the album.
Choose “Friends except Acquaintances” if you want to let friends see the album but hide it from designated acquaintances.
Choose “Custom” if you want to designate specific people who can view the album.
 Repeat this process to hide as many albums as you want.


Note that you cannot make your “Profile Photos” or “Timeline Photos” albums private. However, you can choose to hide individual photos in those albums. Use the method below.

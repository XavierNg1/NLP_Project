 Pre-shot preparations: The ball position for this shot is forward in your stance. You'll need to experiment but play it as far forward as you can stand. Open the clubface and open your stance. Light grip pressure is best.;
, The swing doesn't need to be extremely upright.
 Feel as though your through-swing is moving at the same pace or tempo as your back-swing.
 Make sure the clubface is pointing toward the sky after impact. Monitor the back of your left hand (if you are right-handed) and make sure it points to the sky after impact.
 Do not try to swing at the target. Your stance is open so your body-lines are all aiming well left of the target. Swing in relation to your body lines, not toward the target.

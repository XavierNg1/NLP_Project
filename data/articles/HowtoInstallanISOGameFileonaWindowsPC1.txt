 File Explorer in modern Windows operating systems allows you to mount an ISO file to a virtual drive. Right-click an ISO and click on “Mount.” The ISO will automatically be mounted to a virtual drive and will open a new File Explorer window showing the ISO’s contents.If you do not see a new window, open File Explorer by clicking on the Folder icon on the taskbar or press the ⊞ Win+E keys. In the left panel of the File Explorer window, click on “This PC” to show all drives and virtual drives.;
, The program may feature a “Setup.exe,” “Install.exe” or “Autoexec.exe” to run the installer program. Double-click on these files to run the installer.
 If the game requires the disk to be present for the game to run after installation, make sure the ISO is mounted in the virtual drive.

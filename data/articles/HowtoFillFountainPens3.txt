 The converter will replace the cartridge. To remove the cartridge, simply pull it straight out from the grip section.
 Slide the converter straight in toward the grip section. Some will have small “lugs” on the side that you have to line up with open slots. , Submerge the nib fully, up to the grip section, so that the vent hole is beneath the ink.
 If you are using a squeeze converter, squeeze the side of the pen until the ink bubbles. Slowly release your grip, then let go of the converter slowly to allow suction to draw ink into the pen.


Squeeze and release the converter again. Repeat this process until bubbles no longer appear in the bottle of ink and your pen is full.
 If you are using a piston converter, twist the end of the pen counter-clockwise, which will cause an internal plunger to move up or down. Then twist in the other direction to draw the plunger up to draw ink into the tube.


You may need to raise and lower the piston a number of times to completely fill the pen with ink.
Remove any air pockets. If the ink converter was totally empty when you started, you might notice that you can’t fill the ink all the way to the top due to a pocket of air. To remove the air pocket, twist the plunger counter-clockwise to empty all of the ink along with the air, then refill. Squeeze out a few drops of ink. Remove the nib from the ink, and twist the piston counter-clockwise until a couple of drops of ink come out. This will prime the pen for writing.
 Use a rag or paper towel to remove any ink still on the nib.
 Screw the barrel back on over the body of the pen.

 Knowing something about the artist when you visit the museum can help you understand the context of their artwork. It can also give you something to say during conversations about the artist and their work..;
, Depending on which museum or gallery you’re visiting, you might be able to preview the collection you’re seeing on a website. This gives you more time to look at and think about the pieces you’ll be seeing. And you can do so without the pressure of feeling like you have to contribute to the conversation happening around you.


For example, if you are about to visit MOMA (the Museum of Modern Art in NYC) you could do some research about modern art in general and research some of the pieces in the gallery.
 Perhaps one of your pals has an idea of what kind of art you may be seeing and/or even have personal information about the artist. Ask them to share some of their knowledge. There’s nothing wrong with admitting you don’t know much about the artist or type of art you’ll be seeing and asking someone to educate you.

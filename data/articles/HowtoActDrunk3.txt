 Drinking can negatively affect your motor skills and can slur your speech.To slur, draw out parts of the word that you normally wouldn't. Think of how you would talk if you were very tired. If you want to appear very drunk, slur your words more.


You can say something like, "I absolutely love this party. It's so great."
Another example would be, "So what'reÂ  you doin' next week?"

, Just as alcohol affects the way you speak, it can also affect how quickly you can talk. When people are drunk, they will speak slower. Listen to the pace of your voice as you have conversations with people and slow it down if you're talking too fast.


Alcohol can affect the speed in which neurotransmitters communicate with your brain, which slows down your speech., When you're in a loud setting like a bar, party, or club, it's natural that you'll have to speak louder than usual for people to hear you over the music. When you're drunk, however, sometimes you don't realize how loud you are because of reduced cognitive function. Shout in people's faces, and get closer to them than you typically would.


If a person tells you to back off then be polite and walk away.
 When people ask if you're drunk, you should act offended but admit to having a couple of drinks. No one likes admitting that they have had too much to drink, so if you openly tell people that you're drunk, they may not believe you. Act defensive, and people will believe that you're drunk.


You can say something like, "I've only had a couple of drinks. I'm not drunk!"

 A bicycle brake line works very well to clean sunroof drain tubes -- it is the perfect diameter and has just the right flex to make its way down through the tubes. Clean each drain hole you find near the sunroof base.
 The wire should move with little resistance through the tube and push any small dirt or debris particles out as it continues.


Take care not to damage the drain tubes with the metal rod. If you feel a lot of resistance even after twisting the metal wire, do not push it any further. If this happens, you will need to have a professional clean the drain tubes.
 Check for leaks inside the car. If there are still leaks, proceed to the next step.

 Ask potential lenders what kinds of interest rates they would be able to agree on if taking over your existing loan. The more lenders you look at, the better your chances of securing a better deal.


Some good sites to poke around on include: LendingTree.com, Eloan.com, Bankrate.com, Credit.com, and Capital One Auto Finance.
Always evaluate fees versus savings. When it comes to a refinancing plan, there may be fees or other up-front costs. The borrower will have to weigh these against the eventual savings that they get from refinancing with a lower interest rate. In general, a refinancing deal should include at least 1 percent less interest in order to be financially beneficial for the borrower. However, this all has to do with the amount that needs to be paid off, the interest rate on that amount and other factors present in the agreement.
 When you have agreed on a refinancing deal with a new lender, get that information to your old lender and any other involved parties. This allows you to get the lien on your vehicle transferred and effectively get free of your old loan.
 Wait for a check from the new lender for the current debt amount of your old loan. When it comes it the mail, use it to pay off the old lender. Now you can begin paying off the new loan, which will be set at the same debt amount.


Pay any associated fees. In order to make the refinancing effective, you'll need to pay any costs associated with administering this deal. These include prepayment fees, especially.
 Say that you close a deal on a refi to lower the monthly payment as well as the life of the loan. Instead of paying the new monthly payment, continue paying the old monthly payment. What this does is shorten your loan, ultimately giving you more savings on your car., Some firms may seek high up-front costs without actually sealing a refinancing deal. Hold your cards close until you see the details of a refinancing offer for a vehicle.

 Lettering is not necessary on a flag. The colours and symbols on the flag should be enough to identify what the flag is representing. Lettering is also difficult to read from a distance and will look backwards if viewed from the opposite side.Flags are often hung up high and can flap in the breeze. As a result, lettering of any kind will be difficult to read.
 The best flag designs are those that are easy to draw. Do not include a complex seal or emblem on your flag. This will make it difficult to reproduce. Flag designs should be simple enough for a child to draw from memory., If you have been tasked with designing a flag, but donâ€™t know where to start, you can try using a flag design app to give you ideas for different basic designs and symbols.

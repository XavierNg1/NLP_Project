 Take a washcloth with mild soap (not hand soap!) and tap water. This is the most common way to clean a bat and, depending on the stubbornness of the stains, it can be very effective.Wipe your bat with a soft, clean cloth to brush away any loose dirt and grime. You could also use an old sock or a paper towel.
Mix dish soap into warm water to make it sudsy. Dip a clean cloth in the water and wring it out well to avoid dripping. You could also try using shampoo if you don't have dish soap.
Wipe the bat down with the cloth to clean it. Try not to get your gripping tape wet.;
, If you’ve tried using the warm water and washcloth, and stubborn stains remain, you’ll need to try something with bristles.


Work over a bathtub. Take a hard bristled brush, or at least a brush that's good for getting off a hard stain. Then with water running and soap at hand, just scrub.
You could try a toothbrush for smaller stains, but the bristles won’t be as strong. Be prepared that it could take some time.
Use a plastic or nylon scouring pad to clean stubborn areas that may need more attention. Rinse the bat under clean running water to remove residual soap.

 Pull up an online map and type in the address of the child care provider, regardless of their licensing or lack thereof. Go to a website that provides sex offender registration data for the area of the provider and (if possible) use their feature to show registered offenders on a map. Obviously, if there are registered sex offenders at or near the location, you'll need to find another provider for your child.


Provision for finding such offenders varies depending on your jurisdiction.
 Examine each of these persons carefully for charges of child/spouse abuse, public intoxication, DUI, fraud, and assaults. Some home care providers just happen to be related to sex offenders or violent offenders and cannot become licensed because those offenders reside in their home.


To discover the names of those who live with the home care provider, simply go to the White Pages (online), and type in the phone number (and/or address) of the provider. Those associated with them and the residence will be listed by name in the search results.



Discover websites, reviews, and interactions your child's prospective care giver has had (or is having) with others.
Look up their personal social networking pages.
Look each up as if you plan to establish a trusted relationship with them.
 For instance, a Facebook page filled with dubious "selfies" (self-portraits taken with cell phone) and/or pictures of parties involving nudity and/or alcohol may indicate a lack of maturity that should alarm you enough to place your children with a more competent care provider.

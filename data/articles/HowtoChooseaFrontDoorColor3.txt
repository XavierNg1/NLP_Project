 More traditional styled homes, like Victorian homes, pair better with richer, deeper colors. Something like black, navy, or dark red would pair well with a more traditional home. It may be a good idea to stay away from brighter, modern colors.Old-fashioned farmhouse-style homes, however, are an exception. They often have brightly colored doors, such as a red door on a white farmhouse-style home.
 For a home that was built recently or fairly recently, something brighter could work well as a front door color. Think about bolder shades like bright reds, yellows, and blues., A house that's meant to look like it belongs in a certain era or place may look better or worse with certain colors. An English tutor style home, for example, may not look great with pastels. Homes designed with a Mediterranean style in mind may pair well with turquoise. Think about the geographical region or time period your home evokes and look up houses from that place or time. See what door colors are traditionally used., There are no hard and fast rules for painting a door. If you're attached to a particular color, you may be able to make it work even if it clashes slightly with your house's style. Don't be afraid to break convention to get what you really want.For example, if you want a bright purple door, but your house is an older style, think about sticking to the purple but compromising. A rich and deep purple, for example, could pair well with a house with an older style.

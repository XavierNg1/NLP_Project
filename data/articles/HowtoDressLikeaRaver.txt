 Bright colors and sparkles are your friend.;
, (For shirts, that is.)

, But don't overdo it; you don't want to look garish.
 Not like a school bag, but something that looks cute. Stuffed animal backpacks are always a good choice, especially if they are from a cartoon. Toys-R-Us and Hot Topic are a great places to look for one, or try out online stores that specialize in anime.
 For girls, Capri pants and skirts are always good. For guys, large rave pants are always an option.
 This means no flip-flops or anything like that. Try to stay away from basketball type of shoes (use common sense here.)

, Day-glo bracelets, necklaces and accessories ensure you will be visible. Anything glow in the dark is great, especially if you attach it to your arms or legs. The movement of your limbs as you dance will create wonderful trails in the dark.
 (Kandi: Bracelets made out of chunky beads or pony beads of many colors given as friendly gestures at parties and raves.)

, Most ravers throw together random clothes that look good. Girls wear tutus and short with bright colored bras/bathing suits and accessories. Guys wear bandannas/baggy pants/neon shirts/light up shirts. Anything neon or bright is good.

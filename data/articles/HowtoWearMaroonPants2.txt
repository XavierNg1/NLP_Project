 Pairing your maroon pants with a maroon blazer in a similar shade creates the effect of wearing a suit. Look for a jacket in a similar material to your pants for the most cohesive look.If youâ€™re feeling adventurous, pair your pants with a suit jacket in the same color palette, but not the exact same color, for example lavender or light blue., Since maroon is a bold color, it really pops against a neutral palette. Choose complementary pieces of clothing in camel, cream, black, grey and navy to add some sophistication to your look. Layering makes your look appear more interesting, too.You could pair your maroon pants with a cream color top and a camel pea coat, for example. Another option would be a white blouse with a navy cardigan and nude heels.
 Adding accessories dresses up your maroon pants and makes them look more elegant. You can add bracelets, belts, necklaces and earrings in gold, silver or jewel tones to make your pants look more polished.For example, pair your maroon pants with a cream colored blouse and a turquoise necklace or jewel-tone scarf.

A lace peplum top or a silk blouse in pale yellow could provide a sophisticated twist.
 A slightly cropped pant can look more formal than full-length pants, which often are cut like jeans. Choose a maroon pant that is cropped just above the ankle. Avoid pants that are cropped higher at capri length, as these can make your legs look shorter and are no longer in fashion., Many pairs of maroon pants are in casual fabrics like denim and cotton. To wear maroon pants in a more formal setting, seek out styles that are made of finer materials, such as leather or silk. These make your outfit look more expensive and sophisticated.

 National chains like Home Depot or Lowes will definitely sell furniture sliders. If you are planning to move your furniture over carpet or grass you should buy sliders that specialize in that movement.


If you donâ€™t have any sliders you can also try using Frisbees.;
, Lift each corner and put a slider underneath so that the smooth edge is towards the floor. This will reduce the friction and make moving much easier.
 Once you have the sliders under the corners of the furniture you can begin to push it. Having another person would be helpful to insure that the furniture does not tip. Push the furniture from a lower section rather than the top to minimize the risk of tipping. The friction is almost eliminated with sliders and the furniture should move very easily.

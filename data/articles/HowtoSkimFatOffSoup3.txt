 Shift the stockpot so that half of it remains on burner and half of it hangs over the edge.Consider placing an upside-down heat-resistant plate or pie dish beneath the overhanging edge of the pot to prevent the pot from tipping over.
 Carefully glide a large metal spoon underneath the fat that gathers over the side of the soup removed from the heat.


Fat and other impurities will naturally gather at the coolest spot, so after a few minutes, you should notice most of the fat shifting to the side that has been tilted away from the heat.
Tilt the pan slightly toward the burner as you skim to reduce the amount of broth you spoon away with the fat.
 After skimming away as much fat as possible, readjust the stockpot so that it sits over the heat evenly again. Repeat the same skimming process every 15 minutes or so throughout the rest of the cooking process.

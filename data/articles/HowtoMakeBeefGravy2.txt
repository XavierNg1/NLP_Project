 After preparing a roast, steak, or other cut of beef, pour the drippings from the pan into a measuring cup.


You could also use a fat separator, if you have one. If not, a large glass measuring cup works best. Use a measuring cup that holds at least 2 cups (500 ml) of liquid.
Note that this recipe for beef gravy can only be prepared if you cooked a roast, steak, or other cut of beef that produced adequate pan drippings.
 Remove the fat from the top of the pan drippings using a spoon. Reserve 2 Tbsp (30 ml) and discard the rest.


Transfer the 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of reserved fat to a small saucepan and set aside.
 Pour enough beef stock or beef broth into the removed drippings to create 2 cups (500 ml) of liquid.


If desired, you could use water, milk, or cream instead of the stock, but beef stock or broth will create a stronger beef taste.
 Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of flour to the fat in the saucepan and cook over medium heat until smooth.


Stir the flour and fat together until thoroughly blended.
The combination of fat and flour is referred to as a roux.
For a thicker gravy, use 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of flour.
 Slowly pour the combination of pan drippings and broth into the roux, whisking continually to prevent lumps of flour from forming.


If possible, whisk and pour at the same time to maintain more even control over the consistency of the gravy. If this is too difficult, however, you can alternate back and forth between adding the drippings mixture and stirring it in.
 Bring the gravy to a boil and stir until it thickens.


Do not cover the saucepan.
 Add salt and pepper to the gravy, as desired, in order to season it. Stir well to incorporate the seasonings.


If you are uncertain about how much to use, try adding 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground black pepper.
 Pour the beef gravy into a gravy boat and serve with your meal.

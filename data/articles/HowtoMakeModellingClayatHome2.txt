 For this no-bake clay recipe, you will need the following ingredients:









2 cups baking soda
1 Â¼ cup water
1 cup cornstarch

, In a saucepan, combine the baking soda and cornstarch. Slowly add the water into the mixture. Continue stirring the mixture while heating it over medium heat. This should take about 4-5 minutes.








The mixture will start thickening up quickly. When it is almost the same consistency as playdough, the clay is done.
 When the clay has reached the appropriate thickness, remove the saucepan and pour the mixture onto a clean surface. Cover with a dishtowel until cool.









You may have to spoon out the mixture if you can't get it to pour from the saucepan.
Once the dough has started to cool, knead it until it's thin and smooth. You can also use a rolling pin.
 If you'd like a variation of the no-bake clay that doesn't require any cooking, use this recipe instead.









Gather the following ingredients: 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 cup salt, and 1/2 cup cornstarch.
Mix the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Slowly add warm water until the clay mixture starts becoming hard.
Sprinkle flour on a clean surface, and place the clay on top of it. Knead the clay.
 The clay should be easily shaped into different shapes. If it gets a little too hard, add a tiny bit of water.Allow the shaped clay to dry overnight before painting.








Paint the figures using acrylic paint or other types of craft paint. Add glitter, accents, or other craft accessories to your figures and shapes.
To change the color of the clay, add food coloring to the clay. Separate the clay into different sections to make different colored clays.
You can seal the clay when you're finished by adding a clear coat, such as shellac, acrylic spray, or clear nail polish.

 Preheating your oven will make sure that it is at a stable temperature and will cook the frozen corn evenly. Most ovens will take around 30-45 minutes to properly heat., Spread the frozen corn on an ovenproof tray and season. Season the corn with herbs and spices, or whatever you desire. You may need to break up frozen lumps of corn. Simply place a tea towel over the lumps and apply pressure with a small skillet or plate.
 Once the oven is heated and the corn seasoned, you can place the tray in the oven. Roasting times can vary depending on how cooked you would like the corn to be. The corn should be tender after 5 minutes, but you may need to cook it for about 15-20 minutes if you would like to see any color., Once the corn is cooked, remove the tray from the oven and allow the corn to cool slightly. Season the corn with any additional spices and leave it to cool for about 2-3 minutes. Once the corn has cooled, place the corn in a bowl or on a plate for serving.

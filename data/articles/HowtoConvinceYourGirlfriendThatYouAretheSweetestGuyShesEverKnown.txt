 This step is fairly easy. Just do the things that every girl dreams of their prince charming doing. This may include holding open doors, carrying books/bags, and waiting for her patiently.;
, Try to avoid drugstore items and go for something that has actual meaning to her. Try to think back to a story that she has told you and get something to remind her of that moment.
 All girls love to talk. It's important for you to be the guy who listens. Don't just say mumble or use one word replies. Try to contribute to the conversation.
 Although it may not seem like it matters, saying caring things to her or doing something that she usually hates doing (such as a chore) will register in her mind making her think that you are very sweet.
 The more involved with the people she cares about the better. If she sees you with her parent(s) she will start to realize that you truly are sweet.

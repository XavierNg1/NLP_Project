 One of the leading causes of excessive of bleeding is the failure of the uterus muscles to contract. Assessing the fundus is one way to detect if the uterus is contracting properly or not.


You can do this home (as described in the following steps) and should report any problems to your doctor if you notice them.
 First of all, go to the bathroom and get rid of all of your urine. A full bladder can change the position of your fundus, so get it all out before you try to locate your fundus. Your fundus is the top area of your uterus, and can be felt by pressing down on your navel or umbilicus. Your fundus should decrease in size each day after childbirth.Keep in mind that ‘palpate’ and ‘press on’ mean the same thing. If you talk to your doctor about this process, he or she may use the word palpate or palpitation. Keep in mind that they mean pressing down with your fingers on some part of your body.
 A normal fundus is firm and can be palpated on the midline. A ‘boggy’ uterus many indicate that your uterus has not fully contracted yet after childbirth. If you press on your uterus, you may find that if feels soft or soggy, rather than firm. This must be fixed right away (how to help your uterus contract is covered in the next step)., When your uterus have not contracted fully, you run the risk of losing a lot of blood through your discharge. Because of this, you need to help your uterus to contract, or seek medical help. To perform a fundal massage, gently press down on the fundus and give in a massage. You may feel it begin to firm up under your hands. This is your uterus contracting.


If you are still in the hospital, a nurse will do this for you. If you are at home and are concerned about doing this yourself, go to a hospital right away.

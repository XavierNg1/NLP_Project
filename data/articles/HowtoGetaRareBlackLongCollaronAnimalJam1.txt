 Choose any membership you would like and buy it. Members gain access to several new adventures that can get you the black long spiked collar. Spikes are also only for members if you want to get them through adventures, so membership is required.;
, Make sure your animal is just high enough so you can complete larger adventures. Meet Cosmo is the last non member adventure, and requires level 4 animals to do hard mode. Member adventures that are above that level require higher levels.


Complete the adventures that you have access to first to gain courage for your level. Go on the higher adventures once your animal is leveled up enough.
 This is the only member adventure that is known to reward spikes. Host this adventure with four other eagles/owls and work on getting the purple crystal shards.


To get each of the purple shards in this adventure, have your eagles fly down until you reach a rock formation. Have each eagle sit on each rock tower on the formation until an arrow appears. Follow wherever the arrow points to, and it will lead you to the next formation. Do this again until another arrow appears. Repeat this five times until you get a purple shard. Repeat this same exact process until you get all five crystal shards.
 There are a ton of member prizes that are rewarded on the Forgotten Desert adventure, and one of them are rare spikes, including the black long spiked collar.
 It's extremely rare, but spikes can actually be rewarded from green shards, and that's rarer than getting one from a ground chest (which is possible - see the animal jam wiki wikia for proof). Open all ground chests just in case as well - it's very rare, but a black long may actually be rewarded from there too. Yellow, blue, and even white shards also have higher chances of rewarding a black long or other rare spikes.

 Don't friend people just because you see them at school or you've heard their name somewhere. Just friend your REAL friends.;
, You get notifications if you tag something then someone else does.
 You don't want some random people seeing personal information.
 Sometimes the best way to have a low profile and maintain it on Facebook is to just not use it very much!

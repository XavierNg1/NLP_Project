 The soil should be moist, but not damp. Avoid letting the soil dry out too much in between watering, but do not allow it to become soaked. Water the soil directly instead of pouring the water over the leaves. If the leaves get too wet, mildew can form.
 Rosemary often does best when given full sun. A sunny window that faces south usually works best.


Rotate the pot on a weekly basis to make sure that every side of the plant gets exposed to the sun.This is especially important after the first year, once rosemary plants start to grow a little taller.
 You can keep your rosemary outside during the spring and summer, but once temperatures fall below 30 degrees Fahrenheit (-1 degree Celsius) they need to come indoors in order to continue thriving.
 Air circulation can help prevent mildew from developing on the plant. You should run the fan three to four hours each day, unless you are able to keep a nearby window open part of the time.
 Outdoor insects do not often attack rosemary, but aphids and spider mites are known to cause problems indoors. If an infestation occurs, spray the rosemary with insecticidal soap until the pests are gone and the plant is healthy again.
 Even though they thrive well in heat outdoors, indoors, rosemary often does best at 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 degrees Celsius). Warm or cold, you should also keep the room it is in fairly dry to prevent the development of mildew.

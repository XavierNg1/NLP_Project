 Look for a professional groomer online by searching for “groomer” in your neighborhood or general area. You can also search for a professional groomer in the classifieds, online or in your local newspaper.Another option is to ask other pet owners you know to refer you to a good professional groomer. They may be able to recommend their own groomer as an option.
Search for a groomer who works with your dog's breed and has a high level of experience grooming your dog's breed. A groomer who works on Golden Retrievers, for example, may not be as skilled at grooming on other breeds like a Bernadoodle or a German Shepherd.
 Once you talk to a professional groomer, ask them for guidance and advice on grooming. Depending on the groomer, they may ask for a consultation fee or agree to give you advice free of charge.For example, you may ask the groomer, “How often do I need to groom my dog?” “What types of grooming tools will I need?” “Can you tell me the best way to groom my dog on a regular basis?”

, If the groomer is willing, have them demonstrate grooming techniques on your dog directly. Listen to them as they explain how to groom your dog so you can repeat the techniques yourself when you are at home.


You may ask the groomer to show you specific techniques, such as how to trim your dog’s fur or how to cut your dog’s nails. Or you may ask the groomer to teach you how to maintain your dog’s coat on a weekly basis as part of the grooming.
For instance, the groomer may show you how to trim your Golden Retriever's hair properly and tell you to never shave their hair. They may also show you how to groom your retriever's tail so it looks like a fan so the dog appears healthy and clean.

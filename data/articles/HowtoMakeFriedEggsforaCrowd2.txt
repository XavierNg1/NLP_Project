 Place one or more rimmed cookie sheets into the oven. Set the baking temperature to 500ºF (260ºC). Allow the oven to warm up with the cookie sheet(s) inside., Take the sheets out of the oven using oven mitts. Apply a light layer of cooking spray.You may want to hold each sheet with your oven mitts over the sink as you spray, so that the cooking spray doesn’t get on your stovetop or counters. Then return the sheets to a heat-safe surface before adding the eggs.
 Place a bowl nearby for easily disposing of the egg shells as you crack them. Crack the eggs open and gently pour them onto the sheet one at a time. Leave a little bit of space between each egg. When you’re finished, put your oven mitts back on and carefully put the sheet(s) back into the oven. Bake the eggs for three minutes.If you don’t want the eggs sunny-side up, remove the pan from the oven while wearing your mitts. Flip the eggs over with a spatula. Return the sheets to the oven and bake for three more minutes or until they are as done as you desire.
 Use a spatula to cut apart any eggs that have become attached to each other. Transfer the eggs to serving plates.

 This is a simple method for making indoor “snowballs”: simply take a white sock and tightly roll it up on itself.If your kids aren’t particular about the color of the “snowballs,” you can use socks of other colors too. Try to use thicker, more padded socks, as these will produce larger “snowballs” and be more fun to throw. Using a pair of thin dress socks or small ankle socks will result in a tiny, flimsy snowball.


The number of socks you’ll need depends on the number of participants in the snowball fight. Plan to provide each participant with about 10 “snowballs” to start the fight.
Younger children may grow bored and need fewer than 10, while older children may need double or triple that amount

, To make this version of an indoor snowball, start by turning the socks inside-out, and then cut two circular sections from the body of the sock. Each section should have a roughly 3-inch (7.6 centimeter) radius. Using a needle and white thread, stitch each of the two circular sections closed, leaving only a small opening on one side. In this opening, stuff a handful of polyester fiberfill, and then sew the opening shut. At this point you’ll have two soft indoor snowballs; repeat as many times as needed.If you’d rather not use socks that you already have around the house—or don’t have enough white socks for a snowball fight—you can purchase socks inexpensively at a local thrift store or dollar store.
The supplies you’ll need for this step—needle and thread, scissors, and fiberfill—can be purchased from a craft-supplies store.
 Take one of your child’s crew socks, and stuff it with any type of soft material that will not hurt someone if thrown at them. You could stuff the crew sock with one or two additional socks, a handful of polyester fiberfill or cotton balls, or crumpled up newspaper.To secure the open end of the sock, simply tie it off with a rubber band.

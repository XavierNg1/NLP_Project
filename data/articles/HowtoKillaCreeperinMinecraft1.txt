 Make a fishing pole from three sticks and two pieces of string.Use it next to a body of water and right-click when you notice a trail heading toward your lure.Keep at it until you get raw fish.


The fish trail will not appear if particles are set to the lowest setting.
An enchantment table can improve your fishing rod.;
, Feed the raw fish to an ocelot to turn it into a tamed cat that will follow you wherever you go unless told otherwise. If you have one or more Cats following you around, creepers will run away from you before they can explode.


Ocelots are most often found above sea level on grass or leaves in jungle biomes., One cool strategy is telling a circle of cats to sit around the edges of your buildings. If the cats are close enough together, no Creepers will be able to even come close. Then you can safely shoot the creeper with a bow, or just ignore it.

 Just as you would for a straightforward base oil application, comb through dry hair to work out any tangles. You hair can be just-washed or on its second or third day out from your last shampooing. Spread old towels or paper towels around to protect against oil splatter.
 Essential oils are too strong to apply in large amounts directly to the scalp. Even with this diluted delivery system, you may feel a strange tingling sensation in your scalp. Don’t worry — it’s perfectly normal. It just means the essential oil is doing its work!


Pour a teaspoon of your chosen carrier oil into the palm of your hand.
Add 2-3 drops of your chosen essential oil.
Rub your hands together to mix the oils and spread them over your palms and fingertips.
 The essential oils won’t be useful on the shaft and ends of your hair. You should target your scalp, follicles, and hair roots with them.


Using your fingertips, massage the oils into your scalp.
Remember to treat the entire scalp, not just the top of your head.
 Using a wide-tooth comb, comb through your hair to both detangle it. This will also spread the oil through any hairs that didn’t get treated by your fingers. Split your hand down the middle so you can work with your hair in two sections, rather than tackling it all at once.
 Pour a teaspoon of your base/carrier oil into the palm of your hand. Rub your hands together again to spread it out over your palms and fingertips.


If you are using castor oil, mix ½ teaspoon of castor oil with ½ teaspoon of a thinner, lighter oil (like grapeseed oil). Castor oil is thick and gloopy on its own.
Run your fingers and palms through your hair to transfer the oil.
Begin where the essential and carrier oil treatment ends, closer to your scalp.
Run your hands down to the ends of your hair.
Work your way all the way through one section of hair, remembering to pay attention to the hair on the back of your head.
Give the second section of hair the same treatment.

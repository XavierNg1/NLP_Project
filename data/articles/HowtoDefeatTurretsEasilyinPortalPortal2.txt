 This is pretty much the easiest technique to defeat a turret requires the turret to be on a portal-friendly surface, and another portal-friendly surface, preferably on a wall or on a roof of the test chamber. It will fall in the portal, and when it hits the ground, it will randomly fire and then go into sleep mode.;
, The cube technique is very similar to the Portal technique. First, you must have a portal-friendly surface above the turret, a cube, and a portal surface near you and out of the turret's firing range. Put a portal over the turret and near you, grab the cube, and drop it through the Portal. It should hit the turret, and with the same results as the Portal technique. Another use of the cube is to whack the turret over with the cube, but this really doesn't help, as you will be in it's firing range if you succeed or try to succeed.
 To do this, place a portal in a direction facing a Turret, and another where an Energy Ball is about to hit. It will knock the turret over.
 If you can, sneak up behind the turret and knock it over by simply running into it. You can also pick it up by pressing X on your controller (or E on your keyboard) and dropping it back down so it falls over and shoot randomly then closes.

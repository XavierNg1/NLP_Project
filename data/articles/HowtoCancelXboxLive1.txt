 On your browser, go to www.xbox.com and access your account. Login using your Microsoft credentials and go straight to My Account.


Use the credentials associated with your Xbox Live account. It may be the same as your Skype, Outlook, Windows 8, or other Microsoft accounts.
You may need to re-enter your credentials before accessing the My Account page.;
, In the My Account page you will see 4 main options: Payment & Billing, Subscriptions, Security, Family & Forums, and Manage Devices. Select "Payment and Billing".


Selecting Subscriptions will display your current active subscription with Xbox Live. It also shows how long it is active.
 Upon selecting this option, you will be shown your credit card information and its expiration date. From here, you can edit or remove your credit card information.
 Click "Remove" to deactivate automatic renewal of your Xbox Live subscription (granting that it is set to auto-renew). You will then be asked by the system if you are sure of the removal. Choose "Yes" to go ahead with the deactivation.


Technically, you are still an Xbox Live subscriber until your current membership expires. In short, this method ends your membership at the end of your current term.

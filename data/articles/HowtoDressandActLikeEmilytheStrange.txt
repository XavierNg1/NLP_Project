 This is basically all she wears, so if you want to be like her, you need the right outfit.;
, This includes black tights(stock up on these) and white Mary Janes.
 Don't put anything in it. Also, get bangs if you don't have them.
 Make sure it is black. Name it one of Emily's cats' names, such as Miles, Mystery, NeeChee, or Sabbath. If someone tells you that your cat has the same name as Emily's cats, just smile mysteriously and leave.
 Her favourite ones are "That sucks rocks" and "Gibbering bumfarks".
 Emily was an awesome skater but if you really can't skate or you are bad at skating , don't be a poser and carry around a skateboard. Be a thinker instead.
 Emily is an inventor.
 Don't smile at a joke. Only laugh or smile at something scary or really goth. And make sure you have an evil laugh.
 If you're in a public place such as the mall, look mysterious and sit around petting your cat. But if you don't have a cat don't bother with fakes etc. It looks stupid and won't have the same effect.
 Emily is loyal to her mother, cats, Jakey and possibly Raven., Be yourself. Don't give a damn to what others say., Emily travels heaps. Embrace (if you can) your travelling idk spirit.

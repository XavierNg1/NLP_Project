Once there, build up both Gokus' Ki to level 7 so you can use Collect Energy 3 times, then use the Genki Dama (Spirit Bomb) at full power easily.
Power up to MAX Power Mode with both Gokus.
 Make sure you hurry up before MAX Power Mode ends.


Use your Spirit Bombs at the same time.
One of you should be under the stage, take a while to explore, then if your enemy gets against the mountain you are under (You should see their feet, or part of their clothes)you can attack them with Kamehameha. (Kaio-ken attack will put you above the stage if you hit correctly)

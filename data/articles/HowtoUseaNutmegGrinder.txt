 There is a cutting blade at the base of the container, at the bottom of a spring-loaded plate. The crank handle that you can see on the top is turned to cause the blade to grind the whole nutmeg. The nutmegs on the top are there for both decoration and use (if used before they go stale).;
, Simply twist the middle of the grinder to release the top from the bottom. In the middle you will see a round hole and a shaft that leads down to the blade. Place a whole nutmeg into the shaft.
 Check it is all firmly in place.
 Turn as much as needed to obtain the freshly ground nutmeg. Be sure to grind into a bowl.

 This technique works best if you choose an eyeshadow in the same color as the eyeliner you plan to use for the wings. Otherwise, any neutral color like gray, black, or brown will work for this. Ditch your regular eyeshadow brush, and grab an eyeliner brush., Using the eyeliner brush, flick the powder from the outer corner of your eye upwards. To make sure that both wings extend along the same angle, follow the angle of your bottom lash line. In other words, imagine your lash line continued outside the outer corner of your eye. Draw your shadow along that imaginary line, and ensure that they look even.This is a perfect trick for beginners, because eyeshadow is easier to remove from skin than liquid or gel eyeliner. You can easily erase your eyeshadow wing if youâ€™re unhappy with it, and simply start over.
 Once you're satisfied with your eyeliner wing, trace over it with your liquid or gel eyeliner of choice. This step is much less scary if you have a pre-approved shadow outline to trace. Fill in the wing with your eyeliner, and make sure once again that everything looks even.The shadow will also act as a primer of sorts, giving your eyeliner something to adhere to and ensuring it stays in place all day.

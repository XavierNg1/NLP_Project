 The required engine size is dependent on the amount of power that the generator will need to supply. A good rule of thumb for a useful, compact generator is to choose an engine in the range of 5 to 10 horsepower. Note that most engines rate their horsepower at a speed of 3,600 rotations per minute (RPM). These motors are about the size of lawn mower engines, and are typically available at lawn equipment stores, industrial supply shops or power equipment outlets.;
, This head will use an internal magnet to create electricity when the shaft mounted magnet is spun by the external engine. For most applications, output levels of 2,500 to 5,000 watts is suitable. In sizing the head, use the specification of the manufacturer to determine the engine size needed to drive that head. As a rough estimate, a generator can produce about 900 (749 watts per horsepower is the actual conversion) watts per input horsepower. Heads are available through industrial supply outlets and industrial equipment catalogs.
 This alternator will generate 12 volts DC when the shaft is driven by the external engine. The alternator chosen must have a built-in voltage regulator. A 500 watt alternator is typically sufficient, and would require about another horsepower from the chosen engine. Alternators are widely available at auto parts suppliers.

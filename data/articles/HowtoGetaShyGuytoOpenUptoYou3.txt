 By demonstrating you trust him enough to make yourself vulnerable, he may begin to feel safe in the conversation. Share your interests or thoughts, at first.


You might start by sharing how you spend your free time.
After you've shared factual information, you should move to disclosing emotional information to establishing an emotional connection.Don't move too fast. If he still seems nervous or uncomfortable, don't rush into talking about your emotions too quickly. You can start small, with something positive, such as "I saw this great movie the other week and it left me feeling happy for days.", In addition to being an emotional disclosure, this will reduce his worry he is the only person to experience social anxiety.This also increases the intimate nature of the conversation, as it is a self-disclosure about your feelings for him.


For example, you can tell him, "I was really nervous to come talk to you." He will likely follow this up by asking why. If you get the sense a compliment might embarrass him, you can explain sometimes you feel anxious approaching people.
Avoid jumping into an admission of your undying affection; it will likely be too much too soon. He may become so uncomfortable he withdraws.
 Always respect his boundaries and don't expect too much. The goal is to get him to start disclosing; you likely won't get him to reveal his deepest darkest secrets in a day, but this will help to progress levels of intimacy.


Try asking for disclosures about how he feels in the situation. This is a less serious question than asking how he feels about you or the friendship.
A good way to get him to connect with his feelings, without overwhelming him, is to ask "How comfortable are you right now?"
You can then ask him further open-ended questions: for example, you could start off with "What is it about this situation that makes you feel....?" If he starts to withdraw, revert back to more superficial questions.

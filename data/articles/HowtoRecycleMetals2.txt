 If a magnet sticks to the metal is is ferrous, and if it doesn’t it is non-ferrous. A standard magnet from your fridge will work perfectly for this test.


Non-ferrous metals include copper, aluminum and brass.
Steel and iron, which is a ferrous metal.
Copper, brass, aluminum, stainless steel and bronze are very valuable to recycling centers and scrap yards.
 Most recycling pick-up companies accept metal, so unless the metal you have is valuable, recycle it in your blue bin. You can make the most money on aluminum, brass and copper at the scrap yard.


Bronze, cast iron, steel and tin are all recyclable in the blue bin.
 Make sure that all the metals that you are recycling are thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed off debris and food particles. Empty out cans and remove labels if need be.


Cleaning will help you get more money at a scrap yard because that’s less labor that they have to do themselves.

 You may be able to reduce assaults, disorderliness, and other crimes by limiting the consumption of alcohol in public.Have your city council outlaw drinking in public areas.


Put up signs telling people not to drink in certain places. If you run an open-air festival, for example, you could prohibit the purchase and consumption of alcohol.
If you see someone drunk, call the police and report them. The police can intervene before a crime is committed.
 Walk through your parks and other public places and observe lighting. Report to your city whether streetlights are broken or if the light is too weak. Sometimes, overgrowth from trees will block the streetlight.


A well-lit area is less inviting to criminals. Also, it helps alert pedestrians and potential victims to suspicious-looking people.
 Organize a trash removal campaign to clean up public parks, sidewalks, and vacant lots.A clean area will signal to criminals that someone is watching the area. Criminals will have less of an incentive to stick around.


Have the city haul away abandoned vehicles, since they can attract criminals as well.
Beautify the area. Plant flowers and trees and paint over any graffiti.
 Generally, a neighborhood that has easier access will have greater crime than an area that restricts access. Local government officials should consider closing certain streets and rerouting traffic away from high-crime areas.


For example, you may want to subdivide an area so that no one can drive straight through a neighborhood.This limits access and limits the ability of criminals to get away quickly.
Also closing streets thwarts people who cruise around looking for people to shoot. They soon realize they may end up at a dead end, so they may avoid the neighborhood altogether.

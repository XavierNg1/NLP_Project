 Exercise seems to be the answer to everything, right? Well studies have actually shown that people who exercise regularly have a lowered desire to watch TV! So not only will getting active distract you and give you something else to do, but if you commit to do doing it regularly, it will lessen your TV addiction., It is common for people to flip on the television anytime that they feel lonely. If you find yourself in this position, turn off the TV and phone a friend instead. That conversation will definitely be more uplifting and better at countering feelings of loneliness than another episode of Mad Men.
 If you and the people you live with are huddled up around the TV every night, try changing the scene and pull out some board games. Board games can be a lot of fun for people of all ages. Depending on the game, they encourage interaction, cooperation, strategy, critical thinking, and having a sense of humor. Start up a game and then look around: you are sure to see a room full of smiles., If you really craving some form of passive entertainment, try listening to a podcast. Podcasts exist on almost any subject and in a variety of genres (comedy, storytelling, non-fiction, etc.) But listening to podcasts still helps you reduce your screen-time. Best of all, podcasts are totally portable! You can tune in from your car, the bus, or walking down the street.Find podcasts through a podcast app, the iTunes store, or through a basic internet search.
 If you really have the itch to take in some audio-visual entertainment, take yourself to the movies instead of lounging on the couch. Going to the movies is a great way to get out of the house, it’s a fun activity to do on a date or with a friend, and it creates a much more immersive experience than watching TV at home. Plus, a movie is presented in a limited quantity: you’ll only watch those 90 (or so) minutes, and then you’ll be done.

 While Perler beads, jump rings, and Perler accessories can usually be found in craft stores, you might have to order the key chains online. You can also just use string to attach your creation to the item you're accessorizing.

, Pull out a pegboard, if you're using one, or use a hard, iron-safe work surface like a wooden table.
 Arrange the Perler beads on the pegboard or surface in whatever pattern you want, such as a heart or Pokeball. Use a picture for reference if you need to.
 If using a pegboard, carefully transfer it to an ironing board and turn on the iron. If not using a pegboard, leave the beads on the surface and turn on the iron. Place a sheet of parchment paper or Perler ironing paper over your design.









Make sure the iron is on a "dry" setting, not a steam one.
 Carefully move it in a circular motion, making sure that all of the beads are fused. Pressing too hard or moving too roughly can knock beads out of place! Completely fused beads shouldn't have visible holes in the center.
 Put a heavy flat object on top of your creation and let the beads cool.
 Lift the fused beads and flip them over, then iron the back for a smooth, finished look.
 If you have jump rings, spread one open with your fingers or jewelry pliers. Push it through the hole in your creation. If using string, thread it through the hole.
 If using string, simply loop the string through the key chain's last link (you can loop it through more than once for extra strength), tie it off in a knot, and trim the ends.
 Alternatively, tie the Perler bead creation directly to the purse/backpack/etc. using string.

 To qualify for these more lenient requirements, include the following documents in your application:


Your partner's current UK passport, or a copy of every page of the passport (including blank ones), or his or her registration or naturalisation certificate proving citizenship.The marriage certificate or civil partnership certificate. If you have a different type of official partnership, or if you are part of a homosexual couple in a country that does not recognize your partnership, you may still meet these requirements. Contact the UK Visas and Immigration office for advice., To qualify for citizenship, you must have entered the UK at least three years ago, and lived here for most of the past three years. You are allowed 270 days of absence over this period, but up to 300 days may be overlooked.If you have a family and home in the UK, and your application meets all other requirements, this number may increase:Up to 450 days over the past three years if you have four years of residency, or up to 540 days if you have five years of residency. A compelling reason for absence (travel for UK armed forces or UK business) may replace the residency requirements.
 You do not need to meet this requirement if your spouse or civil partner works for the UK government, or in designated service.This includes service with certain groups not directly under the UK government, such as the British Red Cross, a member of the Council of Voluntary Welfare Work, or NATO., Apart from these differences, the application for citizenship is the same as for foreigners living in the UK.

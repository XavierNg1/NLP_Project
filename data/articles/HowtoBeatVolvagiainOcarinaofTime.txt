, Once you see flames flaring out from a random hole, run by it and wait for the creature to come. When Volvagia pops out, hit her with the Megaton Hammer (Z-Targeting makes it easy) and then with the sword.
 Since she is enormous and curls into a C shape, it can be difficult to avoid her. This is the part of the battle where it's possible to hit her with arrows. If you don't want to, hang off the side of the island and wait until she disappears into a hole.
 This time, Volvagia will fly straight up to the ceiling. Rocks will begin to fall, but avoid panicking as this will increase your chances of getting hit. Instead, run around and dodge the rocks. You can stay on the island and use your shield, rolling whenever a huge shadow looms over you. Another option is to hang onto the ledge of the island again, which shields you from damage.
 Eventually, Volvagia will die. The scene may be gruesome, so it's best to look away if you dislike violence. Finished.

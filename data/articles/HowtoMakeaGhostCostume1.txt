 If you don't want to cut the brim off your hat, you can just wear it backwards. Or, purchase an unwanted one from the thrift store.


The hat should be as light in color as possible, or people will be able to see it through the bed sheet that will be draped over your head.;
, If it drags on the floor too much, then mark the place where it should be cut.


The costume should drag just a little to create a floating effect, but not so much that the person wearing it trips.
, Have the person under the sheet poke out his or her fingers to where his or her eyes are, and draw little dots on the sheet at these points.
 Pin it to the baseball hat. Place the mark you made for the center of the person's head right in the center of the baseball hat.


Pin the sheet around the hat; you'll need to use about three or four more pins.
If you don't want the black dot on the top of the head to be so noticeable, you can flip the sheet over. You should still be able to see where the mark on the top of the head is, but it will be less visible to onlookers.
You can also just cover the mark with white-out. Or, use a fabric marker pencil that fades (invisible fabric markers).
 Cut eye holes where the eye positions have been marked. Circle them with black magic marker. The eye holes should be at least twice as big as the wearer's eyes.
 Use the marker to draw a nose and a mouth. You can cut a hole for either the nose or mouth, to make it easier to breathe.
 If you marked a place where the sheet should be cut, cut along that line.

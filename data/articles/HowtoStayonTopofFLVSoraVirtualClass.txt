, Your teacher is only there to help, if you have any question email, call, or text them. If you still don't understand ask them to clarify. And if your teacher isn't helping you at all tell Florida Virtual School, they only want teachers who will aid you in every way you need.
 Being on a computer all day can be very distracting. To help set up a 45:15 break time, research has shown the human brain has a limited prime-time of focus. 45 minutes is the approximate amount of focus time, so work for 45 minutes and take a 15 minute break. During this time do whatever you want to, but as soon as your 15 minutes is over, work!

, If you just can't stand the quiet play music, don't turn it up too loud making it a distraction. Music has shown to increase focus when paired with work of any kind.
 People all the time will tell you to think of all the bad things that will happen if you don't complete your work. This method however simply does not work! This usually does not motivate people in any way, so try to think of the good that will happen when your work is turned in, you can even make a list. For example you could write: My parents will be happier with me. I will have more free time. My thoughts won't be centered around school all of the time.
 Tell yourself things like: "I can do this, I'm smart, I can finish this in no time, this is too easy to push off." Keeping yourself up-lifted will improve your focus 100%.
 Caffeine has shown to boost energy, improve your mood, and sharpen your mind. Who wouldn't want that?

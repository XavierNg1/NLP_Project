 The intro will play. It will show your character on a car explaining the plot of the other two games (being stranded on a house in the middle of the forest, fending off endless hordes of zombies), you crack a joke about how that looks so much like a game, and just as you are explaining how you ended up in that forest, a zombie with a rocket launcher blows up your car. You are the only survivor (unsurprisingly), and you must get yourself "out of this godforsaken city", the game states as being your main goal.;
, There, you can save your game and upgrade your weapons, as well as buy ammo. You may want to save you ammo and use your knife, by pressing the space bar (QWERTY layout). Keep your distances , you must keep walking backwards if you don't want to be attacked. Practice this technique after you get to the garage, and don't fight any hordes bigger than four zombies with your knife. Another tip for saving ammo: avoid missing.
 Then, just get $500 to purchase a better armor, going from 150 to 200 HP (HP means hit points or health points). Then, don't follow the arrow to the Police Station. Just keep killing zombies until you get $2500. See "Tips" for how to get more money.

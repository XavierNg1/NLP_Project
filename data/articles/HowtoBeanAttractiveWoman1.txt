 Don't copy movie stars like Jessica Lange or Andrea Thompson to achieve your look, If you observe people at a party or any social gathering, you'll notice the majority of guys are drawn to women with unique (but not intimidating) personalities. Focus on what makes you interesting and fun to talk to, and let those aspects of your personality shine through.;
, You can be pretty but not attractive if you don't learn how to love yourself. Nobody will care how shiny and thick your hair is, for example, if you keep complaining about your waist size. Confidence is powerful and infectious, so try to learn to be confident.
 Stick up for what you believe in. Knowing what you like and don't like, what you believe in and what you disavow, is extremely attractive. Being principled will help you maintain your moral compass and keep your social life tidy.
 Every woman has their own perception of beauty and what they think men find attractive. "Wear this," "Do that," "Show your left ankle; men love it, and they will respect you for it too!" While sometimes helpful, this kind of advice can keep you distracted from the real goal: expressing who you are.


Go with your own gut, your own instinct; the men who don't respect you for it aren't the men you want to attract. Besides, women all have different ways/methods of attracting others.

 Don't go to work if you're experiencing food poisoning, especially if you work in food service. Give yourself plenty of time to recover before you return to work (usually 48 hours after your symptoms disappear).If you work in food service and begin experiencing food poisoning while at work, immediately notify your supervisor and leave the food prep area. Never handle food when dealing with food poisoning.
 It is likely that you will feel fatigued as your body fights to rid the toxins from your system. It is recommended that you rest as much as you can so that your body can use its energy to recover. Take frequent naps, which will also keep you from overexerting yourself.


Avoid strenuous activity. Participating in strenuous activities while fatigued can result in injury.
 Don't eat large meals or lots of solid food.Chances are these won't sound good anyway, but your body needs a chance to recover from whatever toxin or bacteria has made you sick. Avoid eating very much for the first day or two that you have food poisoning symptoms.


Instead, consume lots of liquids, broths, or soups. Wait several hours after experiencing nausea or vomiting before consuming more food.



Avoid taking anti-diarrhea medicine. While diarrhea from food poisoning can be inconvenient, it is a mechanism used by the body to quickly expel the toxins within. Therefore, it is recommended that you do not take any anti-diarrhea medicine.
 If you're experiencing vomiting or diarrhea, it's important that you wash your hands to prevent the spread of germs. Don't share towels or handle other people's food.It's a good idea to keep disposable cleaning wipes in the bathroom. Once you've used the bathroom, wipe clean any surfaces you touched.

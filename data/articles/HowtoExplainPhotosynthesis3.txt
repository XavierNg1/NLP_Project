 ATP is a molecule used to store and exchange energy. NADPH is a molecule used to transport electrons. Both will be needed during the light independent phase of photosynthesis to provide energy for carbon fixation to occur.The light independent reactions can be carried out by the plant in the light or in the dark, whereas the light dependent reactions can only happen in the light., Carbon fixation is the process by which carbon atoms or carbon based molecules are bonded to (or fixed to) other carbon atoms or molecules. Carbohydrates, such as glucose, are constructed in this manner. This process requires a lot of energy that is supplied by ATP and NADPH.You can tell young learners that the plant “sticks together” carbons from carbon dioxide.
 The light independent reactions are the last set of photosynthesis reactions. Through carbon fixation, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) is produced. G3P is a small carbohydrate that can be converted into longer carbohydrates such as sucrose or starch.Sucrose is used by the plant for energy.
Starch is stored in the chloroplasts as an energy reserve.

 If you produce saleable wares, sell them yourself! Consider selling on Etsy or another free online marketplace. You can also sell your art on your website, but until your name is really out there you might be difficult to locate.
 If your artwork is small and saleable (jewelry, pottery, clothing), you can sell it at arts and craft fairs. Just book a table, set up an attractive display, and set prices on everything.
 If you are studying art and are not sure how you'll make a living, consider honing an art that has commercial applications outside of the fine art world, such as design, photography, or animation.
 If you are a writer, consider directing some of your talents to commercial ends. Writers are valuable to companies looking for grant writers, proofreaders, copywriters, affiliate bloggers, and editors., Many artists support themselves in part by teaching their art. Consider tutoring, working at an after-school or summer program for children, or becoming a full time teacher of dance, visual art, or acting.


If you have a graduate degree, consider working as an adjunct at local colleges.

 This is a very guttural sound, almost like you think something is gross or disgusting. Think of the vowel sign in the word "took," as in, "she took my example."

, Think of it as saying "jeh," but elongating the j slightly so that is sounds more like an "sh" sound. Think of the G sounds in "George."


The pronunciation rhymes with the English name "Shea."

, This is just like the pronunciation of G, but with an E sound instead of an A.
 A good trick for saying U is to start saying a hard E sound, like "eeee," then move move your lips forward as if you were saying "You." This somewhat "compound" sound is tricky, and easiest to learn by listening to native speakers. It is very similar to an exagerated sound of disgust in English, "ewwwww," but it starts with a very pronounced E sound.


Your tongue and mouth are situated like an "eee" sound.
Your lips are rounded in an "O" shape., It is similar to the English version, but you slightly de-emphasize the y sound in the middle. It is similar to the French pronunciation of U.
 The oddest pronunciation in the alphabet, Y has two sounds: "ee-greck." The second part sounds a bit like "gekko" with an R and no O.


You do not, however, want to pause between "ee" and "greck." Think of it as a two syllable word.
 When adding accents to letters, such as when spelling something for someone, you usually add the inflection or mark after the letters. So, for "è" you would say "e, accent à grave," (or, phonetically, "eh, ak-cent ah grav"). The accents are pronounced:


A right pointing dash (`) is an "accent à grave." Pronounce "ah-grav."
A left-pointing dash (such as in é), is an "accent aigu." Pronounce "ah-goo."
A point up (^) is known as a "circumflex." It is pronounced just like it looks.
 French has a few extra letters and combinations, which brings the total tp34 letters. The additional ones are:


Ç ( Ss ) (Also known as a çedilla, or "sirdiya")
Œ ( Oo )
Æ ( Ay )
â ( Ah )
ê ( Eh )
î ( Ih )
ô ( Oah )
û ( Oh )., Once you have them all down. try saying them in order to practice your pronunciation:


A (ahh), B (bay), C (say), D (day), E (euh), F (f),G (jhay) ,
H (ahsh), I (ee), J (jhee), K (kaa), L (l), M (m), N (n),
O (o), P (pay), Q (kyoo), R (err(rolled r)), S (es), T (tay), U (e-yooh),
V (vay), W (dooblay-vey), X (ix), Y (ee-greck), Z (zed).

 The scrap needs to be roughly rectangular or squarish in shape and large enough to make the cat in the size you're wanting. If it's not already rectangular or square, simply cut to size.;
, This will determine the size of your cat; if needed, find a larger piece at this stage or make the piece smaller. Then, unfold.
 The longer it is, the better.
 Cut a small curve shape from the top, leaving two small triangular points of fabric sticking up for the cat's ears.
 Begin to sew the fabric (still folded). Use a blanket stitch, and start from the bottom left corner. Stop sewing halfway through the right side of the cat.
 The ears don't have to be stuffed, and can be left floppy.
, Sew on eyes, nose, and whiskers.

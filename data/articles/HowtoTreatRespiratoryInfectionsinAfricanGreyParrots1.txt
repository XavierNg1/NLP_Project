 The most common respiratory problem experienced by African Grey parrots is called aspergillosis. This condition is caused by a common fungus, and by can be brought on by poor ventilation, poor sanitation, or an over-crowded environment.This condition can be either acute or chronic. Symptoms of aspergillosis include:

Acute aspergillosis:

Trouble breathing
Loss of appetite
Frequent drinking and/or urination
A bluish tint to the parrot's mucous membranes and skin (known as cyanosis)


Chronic aspergillosis:

Very rapid breathing
Difficulty breathing
Inability/loss of desire to exercise
Voice changes
Reluctance to speak
A clicking sound when inhaling

;
, If you notice any of these symptoms in your parrot, it is crucial for you to see your vet as soon as possible. Aspergillosis can be quite serious if not treated right away. Be prepared to tell the vet:

What symptoms you have noticed
When the symptoms began
Any other health problems your parrot may have
Any medication your parrot is taking
An accurate and detailed description of their diet
Whether or not your parrot has been in contact with other birds (and when)

, Aspergillosis is treated using a variety of antifungal medications, such as itraconazole and amphotericin B. Treatment will likely go on for a series of months, and over that time a mix of medications might be used.These medications may be administered by way of injection (by your vet) or orally at home. In some cases, they may even be applied topically.
 If the condition has caused lesions that are accessible, your vet may wish to remove them. This will involve a minor surgery. Your parrot will be placed under anesthesia, and the lesions will be carefully removed., It is possible for your bird to come down with aspergillosis as the result of a weakened immune system. Your vet may wish to test for additional underlying conditions. Such conditions will also need to be treated in order for your parrot to recover.

 On the other hand, to convert a Fahrenheit temperature to a Kelvin temperature, it’s easiest to convert to Celsius and then make the conversion to Kelvin from there. This means we begin by subtracting 32.


Let’s say the temperature is 82°F. Subtract 32 from that number. 82 - 32 = 50.
 When converting Fahrenheit to Celsius, the next step is to multiply by 5/9–or divide by 1.8 if you have a calculator around.


50 x 5/9 = 27.7, which is the Fahrenheit temperature now converted to Celsius.
 Since the difference between Celsius and Kelvin = 273.15, you can then get the Kelvin temperature by adding 273.15.


273.15 + 27.7 = 300.8. Therefore, 82°F = 300.8°K.
 Compare your result to this table to see if it makes sense. If it doesn't seem to fit the scale, try again. Make sure you subtract before multiplying.

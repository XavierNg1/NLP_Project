 You can purchase a strong vibrating accessory that connects to an alarm clock and vibrates when the alarm goes off.When the alarm clock goes off, the device will shake the bed to wake up the hard of hearing!
Manufacturers also make “pillow vibrators,” which shakes the pillow when the alarm clock rings.
 If you want to help a deaf or hard of hearing person, get them a strobe light that they can attach to their alarm clock.When the alarm sounds, strong strobe lights will flash in the direction of the bed.
For safety, combine the vibrating accessory with the strobe light to better guarantee waking up on time.
 Before going to bed, have them set their cell phone to vibrate. Then, have them sleep with the phone either under their pillow or held in their hand. In the morning, call them and the phone will vibrate, waking them up.

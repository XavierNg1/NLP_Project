 If your browser prompts you, select Run, Save, or Open. The Windows installer is not compatible with Windows 8. You must use the method in the previous section.


The Windows installer will install Ubuntu alongside Windows. Your files and programs will not be affected. When you reboot your computer, you will be able to choose which operating system you would like to load.
 Once you run the installer, you will be presented with the configuration menu. Choose your new Ubuntu username and password.


You can also change the size of the Ubuntu installation. A larger installation will give your Linux operating system more space to install programs and add files, but this will take away from the free space that Windows has access to.






You can choose your Desktop environment. The three most common are:






Ubuntu (the most popular) has Unity, a unique and intuitive desktop environment.
Kubuntu has KDE which resembles Windows
Xubuntu uses Xface, which is faster and good for PCs that are 2-3 years old.
Lubuntu uses LXDE, and can be used with very old PCs or netbooks with as little as 512MB of RAM.
 The installer will begin downloading the files necessary to install Ubuntu on your computer. Installation will happen automatically.


Downloading the files can take a significant amount of time depending on your internet connection. You can use your computer while the files download in the background.
 Once the installation is complete, you will be given the option to reboot now or later. When you reboot, you will see a new menu before Windows starts that allows you to choose between Windows and Ubuntu.

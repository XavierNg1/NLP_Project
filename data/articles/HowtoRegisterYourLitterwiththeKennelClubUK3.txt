 To register the litter with the Kennel Club, the mother dog and the father dog both must be registered with the Kennel Club. Their registration must be in order before the male dog gets the female pregnant and by the time the mother gives birth., The Kennel Club changed their policy on how many litters a mother dog can have. If a female dog gives birth to more than four litters, any litters after the fourth will not be eligible to be registered with the Kennel Club.The Kennel Club keeps a record of the amount of litters the dog has, so if the dog has had four or more, the litter is ineligible.
 Litters can only be registered if the mother dog is the correct age. Female dogs that are eight years old or older at the time of the birth make the litters disqualified for registering. Additionally, female dogs that are under one year old at the time of pregnancy are also disqualified.There are a few exceptions. If the application is submitted before the dog get pregnant, the dog has given birth to one litter that is registered, and the vet provides evidence that the dog can successfully give birth to the litter, the Kennel Club may make an exception.
 To prevent inbreeding, the Kennel Club does not register litters that are the result of close relationship matings. For example, a parent-offspring or sibling mating is not accepted.This means that you cannot register father-daughter, mother-son, or brother-sister matings.
 There are a few other reasons why a litter may not be eligible for registration. The mother dog has to be at a UK resident at the time of the birth. The mother dog also cannot have two litters by c-section.The mother and father dog must not have any puppies on file that were ineligible for registering in the past. This information will be on the ownerâ€™s certificate.

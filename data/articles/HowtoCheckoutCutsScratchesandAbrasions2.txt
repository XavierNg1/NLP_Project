 This happens because the injury breaks or tears the tiny blood vessels that live right under the skin's surface. Your body wants to stop the bleeding, so the platelets in your blood come to the rescue.;
, This is called clotting, which works like a plug to keep blood and other fluids from leaking out. A scab (a hardened and dried clot) forms a crust over the wound. This protects the area so the cells underneath can have time to heal.
 Damaged blood vessels are repaired, and infection-fighting white blood cells attack any germs that may have gotten into the wound. You can't see it under the scab, but a new layer of skin is forming. When the new skin is ready, the scab falls off. A scab usually falls off within a week or two. If you pick at a scab, the new skin underneath can be ripped and the wound will take longer to heal (and it may leave a scar). Try not to pick at scabs.

 Many radio antennas have telescoping links that allow it to extend or detract. Find the link directly below the break in your antenna. This is likely the best place for you to apply your aluminum foil.;
, The radio signals in the air must be conducted by unbroken piece of foil. The signal cannot transmit across gaps in the metal, so using a single piece will help you prevent these from forming., Due to aluminum foil's malleable nature, your antenna will probably be somewhat flimsy until you apply your duct tape.
 This will insulate your break from the elements as well as strengthen the connection bridging the break in your antenna. Continue wrapping your duct tape until the foil is completely covered.
 Turn on your radio to see if your fix has improved your signal. If the signal is still poor, you may have a gap in your foil and will need to rewrap the antenna.


You may notice that different wrapping techniques have an affect on the clarity of your radio reception. Every antenna break will be different, so you may want to experiment with different ways of wrapping to find the best aluminum wrap for your break.

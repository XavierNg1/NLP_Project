 Press Command+J (Mac) or Ctrl+J (Win) to first create a copy of your image. This is so you don’t make any changes to the original. If you look in the Layers panel, you’ll see that you now have two layers with the same image. The original stays safe on the Background layer, and the editing work you’re about to do will be on the copy on Layer 1 above it., It’s a good idea to adjust the name. Otherwise, you could easily get it mixed up with the original. So that you know which image it is, however, you may want to keep the same name but at the end in all caps, add “WITH TEXT REMOVED.”


To do this, right-click directly on Layer 1. The Rename option will appear. Change the name. Press Return (Mac) and Enter (Win) to accept the name change.
 Click near the edge of your text. Drag the tool until you've created a rough outline around the text. Make sure to leave a thin border around it. This action helps Photoshop to do a better job of blending the background after you remove the text., Alternatively, just press Shift+F5. A box labeled Fill will pop up on the screen. Select Content-Aware from the drop-down menu next to Use. Click OK. Wait for Photoshop to fill in the space left where the text was eliminated.
 This allows you to see the image better. Save the altered image. Once you get the hang of it, it shouldn’t take longer than a few seconds to remove text using this feature.

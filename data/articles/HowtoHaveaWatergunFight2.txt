 Take how many people are playing into account. If it is only going to be a handful of friends or family, stick to a small space, like your yard.Force everyone to take part by keeping them close, rather than let everyone spread out to safety for the whole game. For bigger groups, choose a bigger location, like a park, beach, or multiple yards throughout the neighborhood.


Obviously, keep it outside! Soaking the inside of your home can cause mold and mildew and, more dangerously, electrical shock and fires.
Also, be considerate of other people if you use a public space. Avoid having your game shut down by the police or park staff because too many bystanders complain about getting caught in the crossfire!, Remember that everyone is going to need to reload at some point. Make sure that one or more sources of water are handy. If no outside faucet is available, fill one or more kiddie pools (or any other large containers) with water.Keep it fair. If you are going to play a game that involves defending territories, make sure both sides have equal access to water.
If your battlefield is stretched across the neighborhood, check with friendly neighbors in between your house and your friendsâ€™ to see if you can use their outside faucets, too.
Heed any posted warnings. Do not use natural bodies of water like streams and lakes if there are signs telling you not to swim or drink the water.
 Expect very young players to get caught up in the heat of battle. If young children are included, make clear boundaries that no one should cross. Explain these boundaries very clearly before beginning the game.


Stick to areas on your block to avoid having kids run out into the street.
Keep everyone in the open so no one gets lost or injured without anyone else knowing.
Have an adult supervise reloading from natural bodies of water like rivers, creeks, and oceans in case the shore is slippery or the currents are very strong.

 People who were abused or neglected by their parents often mirror the same behavior with their own children. They may believe that the way they were treated is normal or they just aren’t aware of any other type of parenting. As such, they may show their children the same type of parenting.

Your loved one may be the victim of CEN if they ignore, tease, reject, isolate, or terrorize their child. They may also withhold love and affection., You may notice that your loved one doesn’t seem to notice when their child is upset. They may not understand that they are truly sad or angry and just brush them off. Their lack of emotional fulfillment growing up may make them closed off to emotional outbursts that occur around them.

Additionally, they will likely cause the same behavior in their own children when they grow up to be parents., A common type of withholding among parents who struggle with CEN is not spending much time talking or otherwise engaging with their children. They often don’t put any effort into bonding with their children because they don’t know any better.

For instance, you may notice that they don’t talk much during meals, don’t offer support or encouragement with school or extra-curricular activities, and don’t spend much time on a one-on-one basis., Children turn to their parents for support and encouragement, especially when times are tough. You may notice that your loved one doesn’t give the love to their child that you feel they need, even when it may be obvious they need it.

For example, when the child’s favorite pet passes away, best friend moves, or they get hurt, you may notice your loved one doesn’t console the child or even understand why they are so upset. Even just not asking what the child is so sad about and ignoring them could be defined as childhood emotional neglect, and a sign your loved one has it.

 Chop your cucumber into slices or chunks, and place them in the bottom of your cocktail shaker. Toss in the basil leaves, leaving one or two aside for garnish later. Pour your orange juice over top, and use a muddling tool to muddle everything at the bottom of your shaker., After you’ve muddled the leaves and cucumbers, pour in the rest of the ingredients. You can tweak the amount of gin you use in this cocktail to make the drink weaker or stronger, but you may want to taste it as is before deciding to add more. Add a handful of ice, put the cap on your shaker, and shake., After you’ve shaken everything and the ingredients are thoroughly blended, remove the cap of your shaker. Strain your drink by popping a strainer on your shaker, or using a Hawthorne or julep strainer. Strain it into your cocktail glass of choice, and then garnish it with a bit of basil or a slice of cucumber on the rim. Enjoy!

 Individuals with a recent diagnosis of Celiac or extensive damage to the intestinal villi may benefit from targeted or general vitamin supplementation.


If a specific deficiency has been identified, individual pills can be taken under the supervision of a health professional; in other cases, a general multivitamin may be all that is necessary until the villi heal and the deficiencies are corrected.
If the villi are extensively damaged, a vitamin injection may be required to correct particular deficiencies.
 Both gluten intolerant individuals and those with Celiac disease need to begin a dietary regimen that strictly avoids gluten and cross-contaminated food products.


Dietitians can help newly-diagnosed individuals with gluten intolerance or Celiac disease plan a healthy and balanced diet that is free of gluten.
Gluten intolerant individuals may not experience adverse reactions to products not explicitly containing gluten. Cross-contaminated grains and food products with only minimal amounts of gluten may not aggravate symptoms in the gluten intolerant, but should still be avoided by those with Celiac disease.
Some individuals with Celiac disease also have negative reactions to the topical application of products that contain gluten, such as shampoos, lotion, and make-up. If an individual diagnosed with Celiac disease does not experience a full remission of symptoms after careful dietary avoidance of gluten, avoidance of beauty products and hygiene products with gluten may resolve remaining signs of illness.
 Individuals with Celiac disease often experience symptoms caused by intestinal inflammation that may mimic full-body allergic reactions and cause skin rashes, swelling, and gastrointestinal distress.


In severe cases of Celiac disease, anti-inflammatory steroids may be prescribed to reduce symptoms of the condition until a gluten-free diet enables the body to heal.

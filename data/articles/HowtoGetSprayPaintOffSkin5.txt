 Fold a baby wipe in half lengthwise or vertically, then in half once more crosswise or horizontally. You should have a neat little square wipe.









By folding the wipe, you give it extra layers, making it more resistant to tearing and shredding.
Having a thicker wipe also gives you a little more power than a thin wipe would.
This method is not necessarily the most effective one, but most baby wipes contain cleansers that are gentle on the skin yet strong enough to wipe away big messes left by little ones, so they can generally tackle spray paint, as well.
 Use firm, even pressure to scrub the folded baby wipe over the skin, back and forth, passing over all areas of the stain as you work.









Once one side of the wipe is too covered in paint to be of use, unfold the wipe and flip it around to reveal a new, clean side. Continue unfolding and refolding the baby wipe in this manner until the entire thing is covered in paint.
 If you got a lot of spray paint on your skin, one baby wipe probably won't be enough. You can repeat this method as needed, however, until all the paint does eventually lift off.

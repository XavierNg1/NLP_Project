 It is important to try to present the facts as they really are so that people see your side of the story as much as the one being told by those ratting on you or making up tales. Always be sincere, honest and forthright in your self-defense.;
, This is vital because the more you let it get to you, the more likely it is that others will feel they have succeeded in undermining you and making you feel worthless.
 Often those who cast the stones are the least squeaky clean themselves but it does serve their purpose to have a scapegoat diverting the attention from their behavior. Remember that all is not what it seems during any scandal.
 This is not a time for being quiet and helpless; defend yourself with words, authority figures and even with analogies that demonstrate how others are not perfect either.
 Tell them you forgive them their miserly attitudes and lack of a sense of fairness and kindness in the world. Let them know that being the way they are will not stand them in good stead in the future should they try to create a scandal out of somebody else. However, let them know that you are prepared to move on and beyond the matter at hand and that they are not a source of angst for you.
 Talk to people as always. If they cease answering you, simply smile, hold your head up high and walk on by.
 Wherever you can get support, take it. Be it family, friends, teachers, mentors or others, use such support to bolster your belief that this is but a short blip that will pass in time. Learn from it and know who your real friends and supporters truly are.

 To obtain an accurate reading of a solution, you can use pH paper. This is not to be confused with the common litmus paper. Both can be used to test for acids and bases, but they differ in important ways.pH strips contain a series of indicator bars that will all change color after exposure to a solution. The strength of the acids and bases on each bar differs. After they change, the color pattern of the bars can be matched to the examples that come with the kit.
Litmus paper are strips of paper that contain an acid or a base (alkaline). The most common of these are red (which contains an acid that reacts with bases) and blue (which contains a base that reacts with acids). The red strips turn blue if the substance is alkaline, and the blue strips turn red if they contact an acid. Litmus papers can be used to provide a quick and easy test, but the cheapest of them do not always provide accurate readings on the strength of the solution.
 The water sample must be deep enough to cover the test strip.
 Just a few seconds of exposure will suffice. The different indicator bars on the paper will begin changing color within a few moments.
 The color(s) on the chart should match the color(s) of your test strip. The chart should correlate color patterns to pH levels.

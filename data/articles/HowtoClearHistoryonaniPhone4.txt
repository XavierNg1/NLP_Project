 You can delete text message conversations using the Messages app.
 This can be found in the upper-left corner.
 Tap the checkbox for each conversation that you want to remove. You can select multiple conversations.
 All of the selected conversations will be deleted without confirmation.
 By default, Messages will store all of your messages forever. You can change these settings to only keep messages for a year or for 30 days, which can free up space and reduce clutter:


Open the Settings app.
Select "Messages."
Tap "Keep Messages."
Select how long you want to store messages for. This will automatically delete messages that are older than the new setting.

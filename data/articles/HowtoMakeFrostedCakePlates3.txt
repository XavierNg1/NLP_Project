 Once the paint has completely dried (wait at least 2 to 3 hours), turn the sprayed plate over. There should be a white ring with no paint on it, where the base sat while being spray painted. This is where you are going to apply the waterproof silicone sealant. Squeeze a thick ring of sealant around that white edge and place the base on top, pressing firmly.

Leave to dry for a few hours upside down, then you can turn it over to finish curing.
Wait overnight to begin using, so that the silicone is fully set.
 Use with cakes, cookies, sweets, snacks and other finger food.

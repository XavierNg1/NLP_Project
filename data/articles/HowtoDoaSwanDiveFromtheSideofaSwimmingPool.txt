, Only swan-dive in the deepest end reachable, as the swan-dive will take you very deep very quickly.
 Your toes should be just hanging over the edge of the pool. Your other leg can be next to it or several inches behind, it depends on your preferences.
 This is essential for later.
 Be sure to push slightly up, too. Snap your legs together tightly and lean forward when you do. Your body should be slightly bent.
 Do this quickly, as time is tight.

 You should enter the water smoothly with little splashing.
 This is essential, as nobody can perfectly execute a swan-dive first-time.

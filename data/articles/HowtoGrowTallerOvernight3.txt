 Shorter hair can make you look taller. Any cut that shows of your shoulders and neckline will do the trick. This is particularly helpful for petite and/or shorter people. If you do not want to cut your hair, wearing your hair in a ponytail or high bun can create the same effect.If you are nervous about cutting your hair, try on wigs or use a hairstyle makeover app to see what you would look like.
 Hairstyles that are more voluminous in the top sections will give you a few extra inches. Your hair should appear shorter and flatter on the sides. The contrast between the volume on top and the flatter sides will make you look taller than you are.This hairstyle is easier to create if you have a shorter haircut.
If you have fine hair, a layered hair cut will give your hair more volume.
Wash you hair with a volumizing shampoo and avoid heavy products (e.g. gels, serums, and creams) that may wear your hair down.Look for lightweight products that are formulated to add volume and texture.
 Adding a lighter color to your hair will add body and depth. Highlighting your hair is especially important if you have longer hair. Long, straight hair in one color can overwhelm your look. Coloring your hair will add some dimension to your long hair.The difference in height will be more noticeable if you cut your hair and add some color.
Consult a professional stylist about which color is best for you.

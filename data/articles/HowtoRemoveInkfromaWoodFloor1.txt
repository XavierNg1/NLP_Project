 You may feel the need to panic and wipe up the stain, but resist that temptation! Wiping up the stain without the use of a cleaner can lead to an even bigger stain. If possible, blot up some of the ink with a paper towel. Just press the ink stain until you can’t remove any more of the ink with blotting alone., The kind of toothpaste you use to brush your teeth should work just fine—unless you use gel toothpaste. In that case, get some basic toothpaste that can even be bought from the dollar store. Put the toothpaste directly on the ink stain., Okay, now you can start wiping instead of blotting. First, dampen a clean, soft cloth. Rub the stain for a few minutes. You’re ready to stop rubbing when the cloth slides over the wood with ease., Check the wood out to see if most or all of the stain is gone. Then, rinse off the rag you just used to clean the floor. Use that same cloth to rinse off the floor. Wipe off the wood until there isn’t any toothpaste left on the floor. Use a towel to pat off the wood until it is dry., Look over the result of your hard work. At this point, the stain should be completely gone. If not, don’t stress! There are other things you can do. You can repeat the process until you get the result you want. Or, you can use a stronger chemical to get the job done.

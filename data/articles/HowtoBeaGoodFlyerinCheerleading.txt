 The last thing you want is to fall because your body is all over the place. A tight body also gives a structured look and appearance.;
, It only makes you more scared. If you focus on one thing, then you will have better balance. Try to focus on something slightly above eye level in the air; this helps keep your chin up so you look more confident.
 Do this by squeezing everything in and pushing yourself up. This makes it easier for your bases to hold you. It also makes it easier for you to keep balanced!

, If your coach asks you to do something that you are unsure of, try! If you don't, you might lose your spot!

, Judges point you very harsh on it.
 Being a flyer has many challenges, including having faith and trust with the people whom are holding you up. Don't blame one another think what you could've done to make the stunt go better.
 You can't be afraid and questioning things while being thrown into the air trying to spin. There should be nothing on your mind except for what you're doing and it should only be about spinning or whatever your stunt includes!

, Don't try to balance yourself because your knees will become loose and you will fall! It's up to the bases to balance you; if one is higher than the other, tilt. Never bend your knees you can tap the leg that's higher. Try to stand in the center of your foot and don't shift your weight.
 Don't fall on one person.
 Just go along and you won't lose too many points. Continue to smile and focus on having a good recovery. A sour face will bring down your performance score on the whole routine.

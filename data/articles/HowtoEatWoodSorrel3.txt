 Slice up one medium sweet onion and add it to a heavy pot. Add Â¼ teaspoon (1.25 mL) salt and two tablespoons (30 mL) of butter. Turn the heat to medium-low. Stir the ingredients occasionally and cook them until the onions become soft.Instead of onions, you can get sweetness by making a custard out of eggs, milk, cream, and sugar., Turn up the heat to medium. Pour in a splash of dry white wine. You don't need much, so add enough to spread out along the bottom of the pot. Wait for a minute as it cooks off.
 Add one tablespoon (15 mL) of flour to the onions. Stir the pot to mix the flour and onions evenly. Allow the mixture to cook for two minutes., Add five oz. (141.7 g) of sorrel leaves to the onions and stir to distribute them. Cover the pot and allow it to cook for one minute. The sorrel will quickly wilt. Move the pot away from the heat.


You may wish to shred the sorrel to spread out the tart flavor.
 In a separate bowl, crack open two eggs. Add one cup (240 mL) heavy cream, a pinch of nutmeg, and a pinch of black pepper. Whisk the ingredients.
 Dump the whisked egg into the pot with the sorrel and onions. Also, add in 2.5 oz (70.9 g) grated Gruyere cheese.
 Line a prebaked tart shell or pie crust inside a round baking tray. Sprinkle another 2.5 oz (70.9 g) of grated Gruyere so it coats the bottom of the shell.


The tart shell can be made at home by mixing flour, sugar, salt, and butter. Knead it into a dough, then roll it out over a baking tray. You can add filling ingredients such as beans, rice, or lentils., Fill the tart with your sorrel mixture. Place the tart in the oven. Turn the heat to 375 degrees F (190 C). After 30 or 40 minutes, the tart shell should appear solid and light brown.

 Not all sore throats are caused by strep, but a sore throat is the most common symptom of strep. Be mindful of throat pain and difficulty or pain when swallowing. The effects of strep are often visible in the tonsils in the back of your child's throat. They may become red and swollen and might even develop white patches or show signs of pus., Strep throat is also known to cause fatigue, stomachache, vomiting, headache, and fever. Strep throat can also cause swollen lymph nodes: large protruding bumps in the neck, usually in the front.You normally shouldn’t be able to feel your lymph nodes. If they have grown to the point where you can feel them, it is likely that you have an infection. They might also be tender and reddish in color., Be similarly mindful if your child's sore throat is accompanied by swollen lymph nodes or if he or she develops a fever higher than 101 °F (38.3 °C).

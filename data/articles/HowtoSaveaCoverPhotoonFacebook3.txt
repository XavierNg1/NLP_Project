 Hover over the camera icon on your cover (it’s on the upper left side) and click the “Upload photo” option that will appear. The file explorer window will open.


Select the photo from your local computer that you want to be used as your new cover photo, and click on it. Click “Open” on the file explorer window, and the selected image file will be uploaded to Facebook as your new cover photo.
 Once uploaded, you can immediately see your new cover photo. You will be given an option to reposition your photo. Drag the photo to reposition it properly. Since the cover photo is horizontal, you have to ensure that the area covered can fit in the allocated cover photo box.
 This will save the new cover photo you’ve uploaded. It will also be saved under your “Cover photos” album on Facebook.

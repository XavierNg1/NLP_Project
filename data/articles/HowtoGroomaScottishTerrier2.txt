 Clipping a Scottish Terrier takes time and practice. If you feel uncomfortable about using electric clippers, or don’t have time to clip at home, take your Scottish Terrier to a professional groomer. Clipping should be done four to six times a year.Professional groomers can be expensive.

Use a picture of the typical Scottish Terrier coat appearance to guide you as clip the coat at home., After attaching the #10 blade to your electric clippers, start at your Scottish Terrier’s head. Move the clippers from the eyebrows to just in front of the ears. Also, clip from the chin down to your Scottish Terrier’s chest., With your Scottish Terrier’s head clipped, use the electric clippers on the back, legs, and sides. Continue moving in the direction of hair growth. As you clip the body, make sure you clip equally on both sides—use a mirror to ensure both sides are evenly clipped., The genital and anal areas can be very sensitive. Use extra caution when clipping the hair in these areas. If you do not feel comfortable using the clipper in these areas, trim the hair with your thinning shears instead., For some areas of your Scottish Terrier’s coat, it will be easier to use thinning shears instead of an electric clipper. For example, use the shears to trim and shape the hair on the tail. Also, use the shears to trim the hair on the outside edge of the ears and excess hair inside the ears. To trim the eyebrows, hold the shears parallel to the side of the head.Trim the eyebrows so the inner eyebrows are longer than the outer eyebrows.

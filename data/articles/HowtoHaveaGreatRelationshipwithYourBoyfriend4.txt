 A good way to better your relationship with your boyfriend is to have interests outside of him. You and your boyfriend should share interests and do things together, but you shouldn’t do everything together. Having different interests keeps things interesting, gives you things to talk about and tell each other about, and helps you both cultivate other relationships. It’s important to keep your individual selves even when growing closer.It’s okay if you like playing music but he likes art, or if you like baseball and he likes football. You can both enjoy these other interests with each other, but it’s perfectly fine for you to go to a baseball game with your friends while he goes to an art opening with his friends.
 One problem that may arise in a relationship is when you place your happiness in the other person’s hands. You expect your only happiness to come from that person. While it’s important to be happy when you’re with your boyfriend, he shouldn’t be your only source of happiness.Your relationship will be better when you find ways to be happy. This might be through friendship with others, volunteering, sports, hobbies, or academics.
If you have trouble finding ways to be happy, you may want to consider seeing a therapist or counselor to help you work through any issues you have.
 Another way to better your relationship with your boyfriend is to better your relationship with yourself. If you have good self-esteem, you won’t feel as insecure or jealous. Instead, you will trust yourself and your boyfriend more.


Don’t base your worth and self-esteem on your boyfriend. Your self-esteem should come from inside you. Base it on your positive attributes and characteristics.
Find ways to be confident in yourself. Dress nicely, be proud of your accomplishments, exercise, and try new hobbies. These are all ways to build confidence.

 Exfoliating your skin removes flakiness and gives you a healthy glow. Try an exfoliating body scrub in the shower and a deep pore cleansing clay mask for your face and neck. Be sure to moisturize!


If you don’t have a body scrub, try mixing brown sugar with any body lotion for a homemade exfoliant. Apply to your skin in a circular motion and then rinse off in a warm shower.Be sure to exfoliate 24 hours before the beach to give your body time to recover from potential inflammation., Getting a wax or shaving at home will eliminate body hair to get you looking great in a bikini. If shaving at home, be sure to lather up on shaving cream and use a good, 3-4-blade razor to avoid unsightly cuts or razor burn.


For those opting for a wax, be sure to book an appointment a few days before you hit the beach to give inflammation time to heal.
 Use sunscreen all over your body and face to avoid a burn. Sun damage also can cause wrinkles, so it’s important to lather up even if you’re working on a tan. Look for moisturizers, make up, and lip balm with a little added SPF to get some extra protection.
 Sweat and dirt in your pores can easily turn into unwanted pimples and blackheads. If you struggle from body or facial acne, use a body wash that contains salicylic acid to maintain blemish free skin., This should be applied after you moisturize. It usually takes between 5-7 days for skin to peak, so plan accordingly.There’s no need to use a self-tanner, but many find it boosts confidence in the early beach season when skin is still lighter from winter. Remember, pale skin is beautiful too!

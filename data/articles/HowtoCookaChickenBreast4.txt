 It's okay if the chicken breasts overlap, but they will cook more evenly if they don't.Skinless, boneless chicken is the best for this method, but you can use bone-in chicken as well.
Do not wash the chicken breasts beforehand, as this will only spread bacteria. Any bacteria will be killed during the cooking process.
 At this point, you can also add in some soy sauce for extra flavor.
 The water should be 1 to 1Â½ inches (2.54 to 3.81 centimeters) above the chicken. How much water you use will depend on the size of your saucepan.
 The thicker the chicken breasts are, the longer they will cook. They are ready when the meat is no longer pink inside.If you are using bone-in chicken, it will need to cook for about 20 minutes., Use a pair of tongs so you don't burn yourself. You can serve the chicken as is, or you cut or shred the meat, and use it in your recipe. You can also discard the water, or strain it, and use it as a base for soups or sauces.

 If you have AT&T and want to stick with it, for now, your only option is iPhone. Similarly with Sprint, as the Palm Pre only works with Sprint right now. If you are willing to change cell phone services (you can now take your number with you), then this should not be an issue. (Note: It is rumored that the Pre will come out with AT&T and Verizon later in 2009. Similarly, it is rumored that the iPhone will come out with a Verizon compatible version at some point in 2010).;
, Since mobile to mobile calls within one network are usually covered without counting towards your monthly minutes, you may find yourself spending a lot more minutes (and dollars) calling people depending on which carrier you choose.



One of the biggest differences between the Palm Pre and the iPhone is that the Palm Pre allows you to have multiple applications open at once.
The iPhone will only let you use one application at a time, and forces you to completely quit what you are doing if you need to use another application. For example, that means you can't be logged into IM while you are look at a map on the iPhone. On the Pre, this would be no issue.
The iPhone has been out longer so if you desire access to a lot of applications, then the iPhone might be a better choice right now.



The Palm Pre can sync with multiple contact lists (Facebook, your computer, Outlook) and will merge them together seamlessly.
The iPhone can only sync with one contact list at a time.



The Palm Pre has a keyboard with little keys on it, so it is a bit easier to type on.
The iPhone does not have a keyboard, instead you type via a keyboard that shows on the touch screen.

 A small portion of the bowel is harvested and then examined by a histologist who looks at the cells under a microscope. Samples can be taken by endoscope, in which case only pinches of tissue from the lining are obtained.


Full-thickness bowel wall biopsies can be taken surgically during laparotomy (surgical exploration of the abdomen).
 Full thickness biopsies are associated with a high complication rate. This is nothing to do with the skill of the surgeon, but a reflection of the bowel wall's tendency to swell in response to injury, which can cause sutures to cheese-wire through and loosen, allowing gut contents to leak out into the abdomen.
 If you are considering bowel biopsies discuss them fully with your veterinarian so that you are aware of all the risks and advantages.

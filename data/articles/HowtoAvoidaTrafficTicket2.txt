Maintain your vehicle. Cracked windshields, burnt-out taillights, and other minor maintenance issues can get you a ticket.
Look attentive. Being the one in the pack with a cell phone cradled on your neck and a burger in the other hand is not a good thing.
If you are buying a new car, choose a plain-colored sedan with economy styling over a sporty-looking coupe with bright, eye-popping colors and/or customized appearance. There are lots of economical-looking little cars with snappy power-to-weight ratios and safe, excellent handling.
Don't cover your car in eye-catching stickers and/or controversial slogans, no matter how mad or happy some politician makes you. A cop may be a big fan of the guy you loathe most, or loathe the guy you are fan of the most.
Remove license plate frames and dealer stickers that identify you as being from out of town wherever else you go in your state. People who travel a long way are less likely to show up in court to dispute a ticket. However, don't cover up your license plate - you can be pulled over for this infraction.
Don't drive a rolling pigsty. All windows should offer unobstructed views to the driver.

 Most skaters find it easier to turn in one direction. If turning right, your left skate should be on the outside. If turning left, your right skate should be on the outside.
 Have them pull to your side as you try to resist their motion. When done correctly, they will be able to slowly pull you to your side as you form small amounts of snow at your blades. This will help you become more familiar with proper body angle relative to the ground as well as general balance.
 One of the keys to stopping at speed is being able to quickly switch from a skating position to having both feet perpendicular to your line of travel. Start by having someone pull you. Then, practice transitioning from a "gliding" position to a "stopping" position. Once you are comfortable with this transition, work on skating and stopping: from low speeds to higher speeds.
 It takes time to train your knees, your hips, and your feet to work in sync â€“ and that means a lot of time down on the ice. Chances are that you will fall a few times until you can get your balance right. Just keep trying and getting back up. With a bit of determination, you should be hockey stopping in no time!

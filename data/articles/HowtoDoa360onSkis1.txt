 You should be skiing at a bit of a slope to help get you moving.









Start in flatter and easier slopes. This will give you enough speed so that you can turn without stopping, which can make you lose your balance.;
, Use your head, arms, and shoulders to rotate. While turning, make sure that the skis are completely flat, so that the entire surface area of the ski is touching the snow. This will not only stabilize your balance, but it will also lessen the chances of you falling.









Your arms and shoulder create a lot of the spin, so really focus on using them to help you spin.
Your skis should be parallel to each other throughout your turn. Keep your legs shoulder-width apart.
 Keep looking over your shoulder until you've returned to your starting point.








Avoid looking down at the ground. This can throw off your balance and contribute to a fall., Your skis should stay on the ground through the entire rotation. Continue practicing as you ski down.









Gradually add pops, or tiny jumps, during your grounded 360s. This will be good practice for eventually doing an aerial 360.

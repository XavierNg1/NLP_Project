 Start studying from the very first day of the session. Revise and learn whatever you have learnt in school. Do your home work everyday. The most important thing is to pay attention in class. If you don't do that, it can be impossible for you to get an 'A' grade in tests. If you have any doubt, do not hesitate to ask the teachers. Teachers will be very happy to help you if you have any doubt.;
, Always be polite to them. Never make fun of them and always obey them. Paying attention to whatever the teacher says and submitting the home works and projects given by the teacher on time are great ways of showing respect towards them.
 Besides maintaining your grades and being a good student, you should spare some time for you friends and have fun with them.
 Do not make friends with spoilt students. They will make you a spoilt girl/boy too. Make friends with those who you think will help you improve as a person and will show you the right way. Remember that a 'True Friend' is one who wants you to be better in everything and is always there to help you in the most difficult situations.
 Be polite with them, obey them and if they tell you to do household chores, do it for them.
 Eat a nutritious meal everyday and exercise for at least half an hour daily. Take care of your personal hygiene. If you are a healthy teen, you can enjoy your life in better way at school, home and everywhere else.

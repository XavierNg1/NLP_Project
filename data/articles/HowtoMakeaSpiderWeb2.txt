 Pipe cleaners are pliable wires that are covered in fluffy fabric.


You can try other colors if you're feeling adventurous.
Pipe cleaners can be found at local arts and crafts stores like Michael's or Hobby Lobby.
 Twist two pipe cleaners together at the exact center of each stick to form an "X". Twist the third pipe cleaner down the center of the "X", creating what looks like a snowflake shape.The sticks should be spread out in a circle, leaving even gaps between each stick. This forms the web framework.
If you are having trouble twisting the pipe cleaners together, you can use hot glue instead.
 Twist on a new pipe cleaner about an inch (2.5cm) from where the sticks all join. This starts the capture web which you'll be weaving around the framework.
 Each time you reach a framework thread, twist or loop the capture thread around it once to secure it.


Avoid pulling on the pipe cleaners as it can remove some of the tuft surrounding the wire.
Continue weaving in this manner to create the spiral. Each time a capture thread runs out, simply wind on a new thread in the spot where the last thread left off and keep weaving.
 After winding the last strand, trim loose ends using sharp scissors. There are two choices for finishing the web:


Leave a bit of the threads from the framework extending beyond the capture thread spiral––this looks jagged and is typical of the cartoon style caricature of spider webs.
Weave a capture thread as a border on the edge of the framework. This looks neat and finished, like a tidy spider worked there.

Whole black peppercorns can be used to flavor long-simmered sauces or soups. When used in this fashion, a subtle, almost floral, pepper flavor is imparted into the food.
When ground, some of the essential oils of the peppercorns are disbursed into the air and the resulting flavor is pungent.
Crushed peppercorns retain most of their essential oils, giving them a very pungent flavor that pairs well with the taste of beef.;

While many recipes do not require toasting the peppercorns before using them, doing so can help to improve the flavor of your dish. As is the case with most spices, the heat from toasting brings out the essential oils in the peppercorns and allows the full flavor of these dried berries to be tasted.
To toast, simply heat the peppercorns in a dry skillet over medium heat, shaking occasionally, until fragrant, which should only take 3-to-5 minutes. Allow them to cool before crushing.



The classic way to crush peppercorns is by using a mortal and pestle. Crushing by hand allows you to easily monitor the extent of the crushing.
Using an electric spice or coffee grinder is more time-saving if a large amount of peppercorns need to be crushed. Grind the peppercorns by pulsing, checking periodically to make sure they don't get over processed.
Another technique that takes some arm strength, but gets excellent results, uses common kitchen pans. Pour the peppercorns into a large heavy skillet. Crush the pepper using the bottom of a heavy saucepan. The skillet helps to keep the berries from shooting all over your kitchen.
A simpler technique is to pour the peppercorns into a zip-top bag and sealing it after removing as much air as possible. Lay the bag down, smoothing the berries out into a single layer. Then pound the berries with a rolling pin, meat mallet or even a hammer.



Most recipes will have you oil and salt the meat, then press the pepper into the surface. Follow your recipe for best results.

 Peel and cut the squash into your desired size.









Cut the squash in half and cut off both ends. The squash should be able to stand flat on its end.
Use a sharp chef's knife with a smooth blade to shave off the outer peel.Cut the butternut squash into cubes. For most purposes, 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes work best, but you can make the cubes larger or smaller as desired.
Remove the seeds and pulp as you cube the squash.;
, Freeze the pieces for several hours or until completely frozen solid.









Make sure that the pieces are spread out in a single layer and are not touching each other. The pieces of raw butternut squash should be frozen separately, but if they are stacked or touching, they will freeze together instead.
If you do not have parchment paper, wax paper will also work well.
 After the pieces have frozen completely, place them in a large freezer-safe plastic container.









Leave 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) empty headspace at the top of the container. As food freezes, it expands. The extra space allows the squash extra room to expand.
Avoid using glass containers since glass is more likely to shatter in the freezer.
If desired, you could also use resealable plastic bags as long as they are freezer-safe.
Mark the container with the current date so you will know, for future reference, how long the butternut squash has been in the freezer.
 Place the containers of frozen butternut squash in the freezer and store for 6 to 12 months, or until the squash shows signs of decay or freezer burn.









Frozen chunks of butternut squash can usually be used directly from the freezer, but you may also thaw them to reduce cooking time.

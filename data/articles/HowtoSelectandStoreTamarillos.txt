 Tamarillos should be fresh, with no green skin around the calyx. If there is green skin, this means that the fruit will not ripen and it will taste inferior. The flesh should be firm but slightly soft to a gentle touch.It should also be heavy for its size and unblemished. Ripe tamarillos are fragrant.
 Tamarillos can be stored at room temperature or in the refrigerator. If stored in the refrigerator, they will last up to two weeks; one week for those stored at room temperature.
 When using tamarillos, wash first. If you want to eat the flesh easily, scoop it out and eat with a spoon. For other uses, the tamarillo should be peeled. To peel it, cut a cross in the base. Blanch it to remove the skin quickly.


To remove the skin from a tamarillo, boil water in a saucepan and drop in the tamarillo for one minute. Remove and test if it peels easily (if not, boil for another minute). Place in a bowl of cold water, then peel once cold enough to handle.
 There are many uses for tamarillos. Not only can they be enjoyed as they are, scooped out of the skin but they are also great in chutneys, relishes, preserves, jams and sauces.


When cooking with tamarillos, always use stainless steel or enamel saucepans and knives. This will avoid discoloration.

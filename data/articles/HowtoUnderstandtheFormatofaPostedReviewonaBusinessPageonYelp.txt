, Take a look at a few of their stats (which include the number of reviews they've left and how many friends they have) to the left of the review in question.
 You'll see buttons for sharing the review to social media or by email, along with writing a business update, or editing the review if you own the "rights" to it. Or if you really don't feel it's right and, again, you own the rights, you may remove the review from the buttons that it provides. However, your mouse cursor must be firmly hovering over that particular review for the buttons to appear.
 You'll see the rating the review was placed in, the list the review was placed in (optional, only if the user has categorized it that way), along with the review and votes.

 If at-home rehabilitation is not enough for your dog, then additional rehabilitation services would be needed. When you visit a veterinary rehabilitation center, a veterinary physical therapist will perform a thorough physical examination to assess the orthopedic injury and design a treatment plan., A veterinary rehabilitation center has many therapeutic options for helping a dog recover from injury. The physical therapist will decide which options will help your dog. Examples of these options are:Heated, underwater treadmill
Fitness balls (strengthens muscles, increases flexibility)
Ultrasound therapy (helps break up scar tissue, improves blood circulation, speeds up healing)
Electrical nerve stimulation (reduces pain, prevents muscle loss)
Laser therapy (reduces pain and inflammation)

, You’ll probably have a lot of questions about what your dog will be doing at the rehabilitation center. During your appointment, don’t hesitate to ask questions:


How long will my dog need to receive the extra rehabilitation? When will you know that my dog is fully recovered?
Can I stay with my dog during its rehabilitation sessions?
Should I continue doing rehabilitation at home?
How much will these rehabilitation services cost? Are they covered by pet insurance?
What if my dog isn’t comfortable with certain exercises, like the underwater treadmill?

, Once you are comfortable with what rehabilitation services your dog will receive, schedule the appointments.You can either schedule the appointments one a time or schedule a series of appointments at once.


Choose a schedule that will allow you to conveniently drop off and pick up your dog.

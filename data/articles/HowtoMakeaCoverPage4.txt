 Unless otherwise specified by your instructor, your cover page should be in 12-point Times New Roman.You should use a standard 1-inch (2.5-cm) margin on all sides of the title page.
Your cover page should be double-spaced.
 A running head is a header that will be found on each page of your paper. Your running head should include an abbreviated form of the title.Introduce the running head with the words "Running head." Follow this label with a colon.
The running head itself should be in all capital letters.
The running head should be no longer than 50 characters, including spaces and punctuation.
 Since this is the first page of your essay, the page number will be “1.”The page number and running head should be evenly aligned horizontally.
Use standard numerals, not Roman numerals or written numbers.
 The title should be placed roughly one-third of the way down from the top of the page. Generally, this would place the title about 2 inches below the header line.Capitalize the first letter of all major words but not for minor words. For example: How to Make a Cover Page
Do not italicize, bold, or underline the title.
 On the line directly below the title, include your first name, middle initial, and last name.If other students were involved in your study or essay, their names must be listed, as well.
Separate each name with a comma.
 The line directly below your name should state the institution you are associated with. The first letter of each major word should be capitalized.For example, if you are submitting the paper for a class taken at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, you should include this in the line beneath the author's name (i.e. your name, and the names of your co-authors.)
Check with your professor for any additional guidelines.

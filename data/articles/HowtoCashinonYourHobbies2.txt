 Some hobbies, such as playing an instrument, speaking a foreign language, writing, and drawing require some level of skill. You may be able to monetize your hobby by teaching others these fundamental skills.For instance, you could provide in-home lessons or partner with a community or recreation center and start teaching classes.
 You can also make money by sharing your knowledge or passion through writing a book or blog. For example, if you have a passion for sports, cooking, parenting, sewing, dog training, reading, etc you could start a blog that focuses on that topic. As you get more followers some companies will pay to place ads on your blog. You could also self-publish a "how to" book that teaches a specific skill.Before starting a blog, research other similar blogs to see if there is a niche market available that you could tap into. You may find that there are multiple blogs about cooking, but few that focus on gluten-free cooking.
To attract advertisers to your blog try writing product spotlights, partnering with other small companies to do giveaways, and ask your readers to give feedback on certain products., You can also make money through video blogging. If you are great at video gaming you could create a youtube channel or vlog that shows others how to beat video games. Once you have enough views you can start earning money from advertisements that play before your video.


Alternatively, you could create demo videos that teach how to sew, knit, or cook.

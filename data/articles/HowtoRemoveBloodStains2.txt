 This method is best used on fabrics that can be washed in a washing machine or thoroughly washed by hand. If you use this method on carpets, rugs or furniture, you run the risk of the smell of the toothpaste permanently permeating into the fabric.









Apply toothpaste on the blood-stained area.
Let the toothpaste dry.
Rinse the toothpaste away with cold water.
Wash the stained area with soap and rinse thoroughly with cold water. Repeat if necessary.
 Both blood and meat are organic material that can be broken down by the action of enzymes: proteases, celluloses and lipase. Commercially-made unseasoned meat tenderizers can be effective when applied liberally to dry blood stains. Dishwasher powder or capsules usually contain these enzymes as well.









This method is best used to clean sturdy fabric like jeans jeans, but not delicate fabrics. Avoid enzymes on linen, silk or wool. These products break down proteins and could damage the silk, linen and wool fabric which are made of proteins.
Fill a small bowl with 1 cup of cold water.
Drape the bloody region of the fabric into the shallow water.
Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the enzyme product directly onto the wet stain.
Leave for as long as 1 day. Every few hours, massage the paste into the stain.
Wash the garment as you normally would.
 Using saliva can be an effective way to remove blood stains, because the enzymes in saliva that help digest food also break down the proteins in blood, and it's those proteins that make blood so difficult to clean. Note that this method is best used on small stains.









Gather some spit in your mouth.
Spit on the blood-stained area.
Rub the stains out.
Soak the fabric in cold water.

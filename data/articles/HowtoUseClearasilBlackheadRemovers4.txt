 Most of the Clearasil products for blackheads contain a medicinal ingredient called salicylic acid. As the name implies, it is an acid, which means it has the tendency to dry your skin. While this is beneficial within the pore that contains a blackhead, it is not beneficial to the rest of your skin. Therefore, in order to replace any moisture in your skin that was removed with the acid, apply a lotion or moisturizer to your face after you’re finished washing., You are never too young to start using an eye cream. Eye creams are designed specifically for the delicate skin around your eyes, where you should not use regular facial moisturizer. Clearasil doesn’t make an eye cream, so you’ll have to select one from a different brand. Choose an eye cream that helps address a specific issue you have, for example: dryness, puffiness, dark circles, etc.Eye cream is meant to be dabbed onto the skin under your eyes and then gently rubbed in.
You can use eye cream on your eye lids, but it’s not as necessary as under your eyes.
 Regardless of the time of year, you should always apply a layer of sunscreen to your face and neck after you’ve applied your lotion or moisturizer.If you do not use a lotion or moisturizer, apply the sunscreen after you’ve used a cleansing pad or a treatment gel or cream.
 You lips are also skin, but are often overlooked when thinking about sun protection. In addition to sunscreen on your face and neck (and any other area that’s exposed to the sun) you should also use a lip balm with SPF every day. Various lip balms, lip sticks, lip glosses, etc., come with SPF. Look for a product with at least SPF 15.Keep in mind that really shiny lip glosses can actually absorb more sun and UV rays causing more damage to your lips than a non-shiny gloss. But wearing a matte gloss isn’t enough, you should also wear a lip balm with SPF under your lip gloss (or instead of your lip gloss).

 To pull off your look, you have to be completely confident. If you act like your look is perfectly natural instead of being self-conscious, then people will take you seriously and will be convinced you're a real pirate. Here's what to do:


Don't act like you're wearing a costume. When people compliment you on your outfit, look confused and brush them off.
Walk around with confidence. Strut your stuff, walk with confident strides, and pose with your hands on your hips. Don't cower in a corner with your hands folded, because that's not what a real pirate will do.
Wherever you are, march around looking in all directions, as if you're preparing for a sword fight that you'll win any minute.
 To pull of your pirate look, you'll have to have the attitude of a true pirate as well. You can't slip up and talk like a regular person, and should remember to be capturing the attitude of a pirate at all times. Here's how:


Be slightly aggressive at all times. Scowl, growl, and be surly.
Slur your words. Pirates are tipsy, so don't forget to slur everything you say, and never talk too quickly.
Refer to yourself as "me." As in, "Me needs another swig of this here rum."
Say "yer" or "ye" instead of "your." As in, "Ye need to get yeself together, ye mangy rat."
The occasional "Ahoy!" or "Blimey!" will go a long way.

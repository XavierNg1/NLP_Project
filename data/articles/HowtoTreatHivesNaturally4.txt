 While it is not known exactly how stress and hives are related, stress does seem to put a person at higher risk for having hives. Reduce your stress levels by trying to relax. Take time out of you schedule everyday to take part in relaxing activities, such as a leisurely walk, reading a book, gardening, or watching a movie.


Relaxing activities can be very subjective. Find whatever makes you happy and relaxed and do it every day., Deep breathing techniques have been shown to help reduce stress. Start by lying flat on your back. Use pillows under your knees and neck to make sure you are comfortable. Put your hands, palm down, on your stomach right below the rib cage. Place the fingers of your hands together so you can feel them separate and know you are doing the exercise correctly. Take a long, slow deep breath by expanding your belly, breathing like a baby breathes, meaning from the diaphragm. Your fingers should separate as they lie on your belly.


Make sure you are using your diaphragm to breathe rather than your rib cage. The diaphragm creates suction that pulls more air into your lungs than can be achieved by expanding the rib cage., Positive affirmations are phrases you say to yourself to help reduce your stress and bring up your mood. When saying these, use the present tense and repeat as often as you can. Examples of positive affirmations are:


Yes, I can do this.
I am successful.
I am getting healthy.
I feel better every day.
Some people write down their positive affirmations on sticky notes and post these notes everywhere they can to help them relax every day.

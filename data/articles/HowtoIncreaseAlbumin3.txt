 Inflammation and infection can cause you to lose albumin, especially while you’re receiving dialysis treatments. Infections in your gums can be especially problematic. Ensure you’re not losing albumin through a mouth infection by visiting your dentist every six months for a cleaning and checkup.Note that dietary changes may be insufficient to raise your albumin levels if you have an oral infection such as peritonitis and are receiving dialysis.
 Especially if you have health complication such as kidney disease that puts you at risk of low albumin, it’s important to recognize signs and symptoms that your levels have dropped. These include persistent swelling, tiredness, feelings of weakness, prolonged infections, slow-healing wounds, and whiteness in your nails. Bring these symptoms to the attention of your medical team., If you are receiving dialysis treatments, it’s important to keep your treatment schedule. This is partly because failing to do so may hinder your ability to maintain healthy albumin levels., If you tend not to eat a lot, it’s especially important that you make sure to get at least one full meal every day, in addition to any smaller meals you regularly eat. If there is a certain part of the day where your appetite is stronger, such as the morning, make sure to eat a full meal at that time everyday., Changes to your albumin levels won’t happen overnight. In fact, it will likely take at least three weeks for your albumin levels to rise, as proteins build up slowly in your blood. Stick to any plans you’ve developed with your dietitian, however, and your efforts will start to pay off.

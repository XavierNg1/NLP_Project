 Oxygen bleach is an environmentally-friendly cleaner that does not harm nearby plants, unlike chlorine bleach. Read the instructions on the bottle of bleach to determine the recommended ratio of water to bleach.
 Scrub the surface to get rid of stains. Let the cleaner sit on the surface of the deck for 15 minutes.
 You can rinse with a hose or a pressure washer.

 You can make the contest “winner takes all” or you can divvy up prizes between first, second and third place finishers.
 Some groups enjoy a cash prize while other groups give away movie passes, gift cards or privileges, like a chance to leave work early. Trips or gym memberships also make great prizes.
 A consultation with a personal trainer, an appointment with a dietitian, a guest speaker or a healthy recipe swap can all be organized and paid for with a portion of member dues.
 Get together for a healthy dinner or have a party to announce the winners.

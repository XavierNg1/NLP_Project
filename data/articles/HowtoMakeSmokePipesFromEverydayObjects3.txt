 You will need:

Hardwood-handled hammer, axe, or mallet
Bench vice
Narrow drill bit, such as 1/8-inch
6-inch long, 3/16-inch drill bit
1/4-inch drill bit
Wire screen
8 inch piece of 1/2 inch electrical tape (optional)
Tool handle bump guard(optional)

, Place your chosen tool-handle into the vice horizontally, with the crosscut faces facing up or down, then later the other way., The bowl can be no further than this from the handle base.
Too close and your eyebrows are goners, too far and your drilling must be precise.
 (Remember that you can drill deeper, but can never put the wood back.),, To add a carb to clear the shaft of smoke:

Drill 1 inch past the bowl
Flip the tool in the vice
Drill into the handle with the 1/8 inch bit 1 inch beyond the handle to meet up with the end of the shaft channel.
,
Wrap a thin band of electrical tape over the bowl/carb and around the handle.

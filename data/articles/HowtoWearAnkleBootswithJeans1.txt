 The term “bootcut” isn't just for show. These jeans are fitted around the hips but flare out slightly below the knee, making them the ideal cut to wear over ankle boots and other boot styles.


Be careful when pairing ankle boots with jean styles that are cut wide down the length of the leg or those that flare out dramatically from the knee down. If you have shorter legs, these styles can make your legs appear even shorter when paired with ankle boots.;
, Instead of trying to tuck or hem these jeans, allow them to fall directly over the top of each boot, masking the boot from sight.


Avoid tucking and cuffing bootcut jeans. The extra material used to create the wide, open legs can look bumpy and unflattering when manipulated.
 Bend your knees while wearing both the jeans and the boots. If the jeans are long enough, they should continue to hide the top edge of the boots even when the material bunches in this manner.When worn poorly, ankle boots can break the visual leg line at an awkward place and cause your legs to look shorter as a result. By wearing bootcut jeans that sufficiently and smoothly cover the tops of these boots, you can prevent that broken, stubby look and help your legs appear longer.

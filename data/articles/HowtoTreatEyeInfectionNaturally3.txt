 Blepharitis is a chronic inflammation of one or both eyelids. It is not contagious and is often caused by bacterial infection (staphylococcal) or by long-term skin conditions like dandruff or rosacea. It can also be caused by excessive oil production in the eyelid, which leads to bacterial infection. The two main types of blepharitis are anterior, which affects the outer edge of the eyelid, and posterior, which affects the inner edge., The most common symptoms of blepharitis include:


redness
irritation
watery eyes
sticky eyelids
sensitivity to light
persistent itching
the presence of flaky "scales"., Anyone of any age can contract blepharitis, though people with pre-existing skin conditions like dandruff or rosacea are often at a higher risk., There is no medication used to treat blepharitis, so the best course of action is to treat the symptoms to reduce pain and irritation.


Use a warm washcloth compress. Re-wet as needed for five to ten minutes, several times each day.Gently wash your eyelids with a non-irritating baby shampoo to remove crusts and flakes. Be sure to thoroughly rinse off the eyes and face after washing.Avoid wearing contact lenses and eye makeup during an outbreak.
Massage eyelid glands as needed to release excess oil. Always wash hands before and after touching the eyes., Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic, such as azithromycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, or tetracycline to treat your blepharitis infection.

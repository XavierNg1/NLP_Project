 Remove as much of the glue that you can. Even if it has dried, you should still attempt to remove residual glue.


If the glue is fresh, dab at the spot with a towel. Soak up as much of the glue as you can.
If the spot has dried, use a damp towel instead. Make sure the water on the towel is warm enough to cause the glue to soften.;
, Pour distilled white vinegar into a cloth and wipe the area for at least a minute, being sure to adequately wet the area. Leave the vinegar on the spot for at least 15 minutes.You can also use equal parts water and vinegar if you prefer. However, you may need to leave the mixture on overnight.
The vinegar should cause the adhesive to start peeling off fairly quickly and easily.
Use a wet cloth to remove any adhesive and let the area sit to dry.
Be sure to use only distilled, white vinegar and test a small area before using the solution on larger areas.
 An alternative to white vinegar is to use dish soap, a common household product. You will want to combine approximately one tablespoon of dish soap with one cup of warm water.Using a cloth, apply the mixture directly to the residual adhesive. Gently scrub the spot, but be careful not to apply too much pressure, as you donâ€™t want the glue to get pushed deeper into the carpet.
Pat the spot dry with another cloth and let it sit.

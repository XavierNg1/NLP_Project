 Do not just assume that you are in the right. Do your research before you do the recording, or you might find yourself sitting in jail for having broken the law.;
, While you don't need a sign saying something like, "Hey, I'm video taping here!", it is a good idea to make it fairly obvious that you are recording. Your legal standing will be much stronger.
 Most cops aren't used to being filmed, and might get nervous. They might not know the laws either (they're human), and arrest you for recording them. Whether or not you are in the right, it is still very unnerving.


When confronted by a police officer, a good response would be something like; “Officer, I’m not interfering. I’m asserting my First Amendment rights. You’re being documented and recorded offsite.”, That is against the law, and could get you arrested.
 Try anonymously uploading it to YouTube instead, as this is probably the safest thing for you to do in these uncertain times.
 Just because you believe it is legal, doesn't mean it is, or that the cop knows it's legal. Even if you are wrongly arrested, you are still arrested. Be prepared. Things that you can do to be prepared are:


Have your lawyer's number handy.
Have a way of getting funds to make bail.
Do not resist the cops when they arrest you. That will only make things worse and get you a real charge.
 Whether it is an iPhone, video camera, or something else, know the easiest and quickest way to get around and use it.


Do not point your device like a weapon. The police would be well within their rights to defend their lives with deadly force if they think you are holding a weapon on them.

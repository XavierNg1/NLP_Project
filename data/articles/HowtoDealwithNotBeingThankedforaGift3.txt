 Perhaps during the next holiday season, you only give gifts to people who said “thank you” to you the previous season. Or maybe you skip giving someone a gift for their birthday the following year because they did not seem to appreciate the gift you gave them this year.You may set your own limits around giving gifts to only those who appreciate them based on your comfort level. For example, you may not be able to get out of giving a close relative a gift, even when they do not say “thank you.” Rather than get them a lavish gift, you may go for a less expensive gift so you spend less money on them and potentially feel less upset about not receiving a thank you from them.
 Moving forward, you may also try to give gifts to others without the expectation of a thank you. This may be hard to do, but setting yourself up for no thanks or praise at the onset can make it easier for you to give gifts freely and generously. Practicing giving without acknowledgement from others can be a good way to be more selfless and generous towards others.For example, for the holiday season, you may focus on giving gifts to those you love and let go of expectations around receiving a thank you from them. That way, when and if you do receive thank you’s from them, you will feel surprised and pleased.
 If you do not feel comfortable giving without expectation, you may decide to skip gift giving all together. Rather than spend a lot of money on gifts every year for friends and relatives, you may opt for spending that money on yourself instead. You may feel better about focusing on your own needs rather than give to others, especially if you do not get the thanks and praise you feel you deserve.


Another option is to donate money to charities or local organizations rather than to family or friends, as you will definitely receive thanks and praise from a charity or organization for your gift. This may be a good way to still give to others and get the thanks you are seeking.

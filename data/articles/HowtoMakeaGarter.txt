 This pattern uses wide ribbon, making it easy to put the garter together. You'll need to decide what color is suitable and the texture of the ribbon.









If it's for a wedding, the ribbon should probably be satin or velvet, although any quality ribbon will be ideal.
As for color, this could be themed with an outfit, it could be blue for the "something blue" in a wedding or it might be cream or beige, which is neutral enough to go with any outfit. The "something blue" for the garter is actually traditional, and dates back to the fourteenth century––blue symbolizes love, purity and faithfulness.For a stage costume, brighter colors are useful, especially if the garter is meant to be seen by the audience.;
, The wrong sides should face each other so that they end up inside the garter, with the right side facing out.
 Use straight stitch and sew along the edges. It's important to keep as close as you can to the ribbon edging. Once you've stitched down both sides, the result is a casing.










An alternative method involves simply stitching the lace straight around the middle of the garter. This requires careful hand stitching to avoid sewing the casing and elastic together though.
 Use a zigzag stitch to keep the lace edging in place.
 You should now have both sides of the garter casing edged with lace.
 Pull this needle through the casing and tie the elastic in a small knot. This will bring the garter together in a round but the ribbon casing won't yet be sewn together. The ribbon should now bunch up around the elastic.
,,, Hold in place tightly, to gather the tulle into a rosette shape. Stitch the rosette in place on the garter where the two pieces of ribbon were joined together, facing outward.
 Sew into the middle of the rosette.
 The garter is now ready for wearing.

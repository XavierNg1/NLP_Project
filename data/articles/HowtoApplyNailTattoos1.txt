Some water slide tattoos made for nails can be used with any color.;
, Try using sewing scissors or nail scissors; a curved blade will work well. Pick the pieces of the tattoos you like best, and make sure each piece will fit on one of your nails without any overlap. At least part of your nail plate should show around each tattoo piece.

You can remove tattoos from a bowl of water with tweezers, after soaking them., Press down firmly and evenly.

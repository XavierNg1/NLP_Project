 Stand with your feet parallel to one another, about shoulder-width apart. Raise your heels off the ground so that you are standing on the balls of your feet, and then slowly lower yourself back down.If your ankles feel particularly weak, or if you have balance issues, you can perform this exercise with your back against a wall.
For a bit more resistance and a slightly more difficult work exercise, hold free weights in your hands as you perform the exercise. Don't use anything overly heavy, particularly if you are just beginning to work on strengthening your ankles.
This will also strengthen your calf muscles.
 Stand at the edge of an exercise step deck or a large book, with your heels over the edge and the balls of your feet on the step. Slowly lower your body so that the balls of your feet stay on the book but your heels touch the ground. Raise your body back up and hold the position for a few seconds before you lower yourself back down again.Your heels might touch the ground depending on the height of your step, but be sure to control the lowering of your body and avoid smacking your heels when you reach the bottom of the stretch.
 Tie a belt or a similar sized piece of rope around both ends of a light dumbbell so it forms a triangle when you hold it by the center of the belt or rope. Sit on a counter and insert your feet (covered by shoes) into the triangle, resting the rope just below your toes. Lower the weight by pointing your feet slowly downward. Then using your ankles, lift the weight back up.

 You can either shampoo and condition your hair or just use a spray bottle to get it wet, then pat gently with a towel. You want it to be damp, but not soaking wet.









Some people get better results with hair that hasn't been washed in a couple of days. The natural oils produced by the scalp can help give hair that tousled, textured, beachy look., This is especially useful if you have just shampooed and conditioned your hair. Smooth some curling cream from the roots to the tips while your hair is still damp.
 Divide it the same way you would if you were creating pigtails, into two equal sections at the nape of your neck.
 Twist them tightly, starting at the nape of your neck and ending at the tips of your hair. Secure the twist with a rubber band.









If you have very thick hair, divide it into four sections and twist the sections together in pairs.
 Use a hairpin or a hair clip to clip it to the top of your head.
 You can go to sleep and let it dry overnight, or wait 4 - 6 hours to let it completely dry during the day. If you take out the twists while they're still wet, the waves will fall out.
 Let your hair loose and gently run your fingers through the waves to give them some body.
 You can use special sea salt spray to get a truly ocean-inspired look, or simply spray on some hair spray to keep your waves in place all day long.









You can make your own sea salt spray by mixing 8 oz. water with 1 tablespoon of sea salt. Use more sea salt for more texture, and less for less texture.
You can also mix water, salt, a drop of coconut oil and a squeeze of lemon.

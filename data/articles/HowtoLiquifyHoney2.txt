 Many people use honey in their diet because it contains enzymes that assist in digestion and promote overall health. If you are one of them, and find yourself with a crystallized mass of hard honey, use a warm water bath for best results.


As mentioned above, microwaving can not only affect the taste of the honey, it can also zap the honey beyond the point in which its enzymes break down. Since you can control the temperature of a water bath more easily, you are less likely to lose the beneficial aspects of honey using this method.
 Avoid plastic containers if you can; not only are they shallower (making tipping over a very real possibility), they are also worse at conducting heat., After water has reached about 105°F (40ºC), remove the saucepan from the heat source. The water will continue to heat even after the heat source has been removed.


If you don't have a thermometer to accurately judge the temperature of the water, look for bubbles to start forming on the outside of the saucepan. Small bubbles start forming at 105°F (40°C).You should still be able to dunk a finger in the water comfortably at 105°F (40°C).
Do not exceed 115°F (46°C) when warming. If there's any doubt about the temperature of your water, let it cool down and start over. Honey that is warmed above 115°F (46°C) is not longer considered raw., Open the honey jar and carefully place the honey in the water bath. Wait for the warm water to begin breaking down the glucose crystals on the sides of the honey jar.
 Crystallized honey is a poor heat conductor; stirring will help transfer heat more evenly from the sides of the jar to the middle of the honey.
 Since the water bath — removed from its heat source — will only get colder, you're in no danger of overheating the honey by simply leaving it in the water bath. Stir occasionally for best results; otherwise, set it and forget it.

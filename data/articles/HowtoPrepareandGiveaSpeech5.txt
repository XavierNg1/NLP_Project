Make eye contact with members of your audience. If eye contact is too intense for you, look just above their heads at a point such as a clock or a painting.
Move your eyes around your audience so that everyone feels included in the presentation.
 The natural adrenaline rush that you will have in front of your audience may make you want to speak much too quickly. And have a confident smile on your face.
 If by chance, you forget your speech, then simply say thank you and leave the stage. Your audience will find you much more easy to relate to, and you won't lose their confidence in your knowledge of your subject.
 Acknowledge your audience with a smile, a brief nod or a slight bow, if appropriate.

 Dry skin can be very itchy, especially for older adults whose skin may be thinner. If your itchy feet have dry, ashy skin, use a daily moisturizing cream, lotion, or ointment on your feet every day.

Look for a product with a petrolatum base, which can soften and moisturize even dry, cracked skin., Soak your feet in cool water, or place a cool wet cloth against the itchy areas of your feet. Cool water can be soothing to irritated, itchy skin.You can do this daily, or even several times daily - but if soaking often, be sure to moisturize your skin afterwards., Oatmeal baths have traditionally been used to soothe itchy skin.

 Soak your feet in salt water to relieve aching and potentially help with itching and irritation. Dissolve 2 teaspoons of salt for each pint of warm water you use. Use a shallow pan or a few inches of water in the bathtub - enough to cover the tops of your feet. Soak for 5-10 minutes.You can do this hourly until your itching improves. Salt can dry out your skin, so rinse your feet in cool water and moisturize your feet after your salt soak.
 Itchiness can be caused by even a mild allergic reaction to something you’re wearing or a product you’re using. Try making one small change at a time to identify your trigger – switch laundry detergent, change your soap, and wear only natural cotton socks. If you can identify what is causing your itching, avoid your trigger in the future.OTC antihistamines may relieve itching that’s caused by allergic reactions.

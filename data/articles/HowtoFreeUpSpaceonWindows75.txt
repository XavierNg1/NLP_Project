 Go to the Pictures, Videos, Music, and Documents folders to find old media you might not want anymore.


You may have these files in different locations.
Before deleting these files, you may want to back them up to a CD, DVD, or an external hard drive.
 Once you've found media files you don't want, delete them.


Movie files can take up especially large amounts of space.

 Fry as much bacon as desired. No more than two strips of bacon per scoop of ice cream is recommended.;
, Chop up the bacon into minuscule bits. Set it in a bowl on the side.
 Take the chocolate ice cream and scoop it into a bowl separate from the bacon. The dish will taste better if the ice cream has defrosted a bit and is just starting to melt.
 Sprinkle the bacon bits on top of the ice cream. If you're willing to go the extra mile, flatten the ice cream, sprinkle on some bacon, and then give your ice cream a scoop like shape again. This will embed bacon bits into the scoop and add some extra crunch to the ice cream itself.
 Get some chocolate syrup and drizzle on top of everything.
 Chocolate bacon ice cream always tastes better with a cold glass of milk.

 There are many ways you may be able to advocate professionally for the elderly. People work as patient advocates between elders and medical professionals, caregivers, or as coordinators helping elderly individuals enroll in medical or government benefit programs.Understand that most forms of elder care will require some sort of training. Look into the requirements for the field of elder advocacy that interests you and see if it is feasible for you to accomplish with your schedule and personal finances.
Talk to professionals in different fields of elder advocacy and ask them, "What kind of training did you need for this job? What did the training prepare you for and what did it not cover?"

, Once you have your field picked out, enroll in the courses or program necessary for you to get into your field. Check with local colleges, junior colleges, and community centers to see if they offer programs relevant to your field of interest.Enrolling in a patient advocacy certification program, for example, will teach you about the medical programs relevant to seniors, and the type of specialized care necessary for the elderly, as well as how to work with medical professionals to make sure these needs are met.
 Look for employment in under-served elderly communities near you. Talk to local hospitals or nursing homes to see if your services are needed, or look at working as an independent, third-party contractor.


If possible, opt for employment within the elder care community. Third party contracting may be costly for elderly citizens, and may only be accessible for some.
Consider non-traditional jobs such as those working with your local government or for a non-profit organization, as well as those directly within senior communities.

 This formula is for finding the slope given two points on a line: m=y2−y1x2−x1{\displaystyle m={\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}}, where m{\displaystyle m} equals the slope of the line, (x1,y1){\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})} equal the coordinates of the starting point on the line, and (x2,y2){\displaystyle (x_{2},y_{2})} equal the coordinates of the ending point on the line.
 To use this method, you need to be given the coordinates, as you will likely not see them plotted on a graph. Don’t forget to keep your coordinates in the correct positions. You should be subtracting the coordinates of the starting point from the coordinates of the ending point.

For example, if your points are (-4, 7) and (-1, 3), your formula will look like this: m=3−7−1−(−4){\displaystyle m={\frac {3-7}{-1-(-4)}}}.
 Subtract the values in the numerator and denominator. Then, simplify the slope, if necessary. You would simplify the slope just as you would  simplify any fraction. For example:m=3−7−1−(−4){\displaystyle m={\frac {3-7}{-1-(-4)}}}m=−43{\displaystyle m={\frac {-4}{3}}}So, the slope of the line is −43{\displaystyle {\frac {-4}{3}}}. Note that since the slope is negative, the line is moving down to the right.

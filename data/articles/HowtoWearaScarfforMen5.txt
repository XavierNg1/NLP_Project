 Hang the scarf off the back of your neck so that the ends drape straight down across your chest.


One end should hang slightly lower than the other. The short end should extend down to your mid to low chest, while the long end should drape down to your upper waist.
Note that a medium-length scarf works well for this style.
Scarves with patterns or thicker weaves work especially well since the knot is easier to see as a result.
This style is moderately to very warm, depending on how tight the knot is tied.



Keep the knot loose so that it will be easy to adjust and easy to stuff the other end through.
 Pull the short end of the scarf into the top of the knot and out through the bottom of the knot.


If the knot is too tight to slip the other end through, loosen it slightly without undoing it.
 Readjust the ends of the scarf so that they are about equal in length.


Pull on the knotted end slightly to tighten the knot around the other end.
This style is often worn outside of your jacket or overcoat.

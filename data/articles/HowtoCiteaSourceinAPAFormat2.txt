 To correctly create a citation for a book, list the name of the author (last name first), the publication date, the title of the work, the place of publication, and the publishing company. If you don’t have any of those pieces of information, simply exclude them from your citation.

To cite a website, give the author, date of publication, title, and the URL to the page.


For example: Alexander, 2012. Tips for Healthy Relationships. http://www.psychologywebsitehere.com/tipsforhealthyrelationships., In-text citations are required by APA format and are used to cite a source within your writing. They must be given at the end of the sentence which uses information from the cited source, and before the period at the sentence. Place in-text citations in parentheses, and include the author name and the date of publication. If you don’t have either of these, use the title of the work you are citing.


If you don’t reference the author in your sentence, end the sentence with (Jones, 2001).
If you want to include the name of your author in your sentence, cite the date in parentheses directly after their name rather than at the end of the sentence. For example: “Jones (2001) also had an interesting theory when she stated...”

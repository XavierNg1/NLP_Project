 Use a comb to separate each section from the rest of your hair. After you have separated each section, braid it and secure it with a small elastic hair band. Leave about a 1” tail of unbraided hair at the bottom of the braid. , Continue sectioning and braiding your hair until you have braided all of it. The number of braids you will have when you are done will depend on the thickness of your hair, but you should have several small braids when you are done. , Secure the towel with a strong hair clip or safety pin.The towel will help prevent hair from getting on your neck and clothing. You may also want to put some newspaper on the floor to catch the hair that you trim off.
 Cut the ¼”- ½”section off the bottom of the braid. Make sure the scissors you use are meant for cutting hair and that they are very sharp.Make sure that you cut straight across and not at an angle. , Take your hair out of the braids, run your fingers through your hair, and shake out your curls.
 Inspect your hair from all angles and make sure it looks how you want it to look. Use the scissors to touch up any spots that don’t look right. Look for any strands that are drastically longer than others or that are angled differently and trim as needed.

 The first five numbers range from 1 to 75, and the last number is called the Mega Ball, which can be anywhere from 1 to 15. The Mega Ball can be the same number as the first five, but those numbers will be different. Your winnings are based on how many of your numbers are the same as the numbers listed each week. You win more for having more numbers matched, but you can still win smaller amounts by having just a couple matching numbers.
 This number is added to boost how much money players can win from their numbers. You could have four matching numbers and win only $500. However, if the Mega Ball matches correctly, then that prize is boosted to $5,000. In order to get a jackpot, you need to match all five numbers and have the correct Mega Ball. , Players have the option to purchase a Megaplier, which will randomly choose a number between 2 and 5. If you win a prize, then your winnings will be multiplied by this number, except for a jackpot. For example, if you won $50 and had a 3x Megaplier, then you would win $150. Note that the Megaplier is not available in all states, but it is available for purchase online.

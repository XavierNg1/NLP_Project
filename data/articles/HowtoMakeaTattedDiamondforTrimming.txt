 They should not be far from each other. Each is composed of 5 double stitches, 7 rather long purl divided one from the other by 2 double stitches, 5 double stitches. Instead of making the first purl in each of the 3 next leaves, fasten the cotton to the last leaf of preceding leaf.;
, Begin a fresh circle by 2 double stitches, 7 purl divided by 2 double stitches, 2 more double stitches.
 Work a very small circle thus: 2 double stitches, fasten the cotton to the last purl of the first circle, 3 double stitches, 1 purl, 2 double stitches.
 Work a larger circle thus: 2 double stitches fastened to the purl of the small circle, 2 double stitches, 4 purl divided by 2 double stitches, 2 more double stitches.
 Work another small circle similar to that above-described.
 Then to the fourth purl of the same leaf, and repeat from * (step 4) three times more, always fastening the first purl of the first circle you are working (each time you repeat the pattern) to the purl of the last small circle last worked.

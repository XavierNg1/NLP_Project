 Write down some of your most troubling problems. Not any minor ones, but major ones, such as friendship problems, family problems, school problems, or even physical problems. Remember that you can't really live a life with no problems and you'll always have problems but you have to know how to fix them.;
, Figure out how serious each of the problems are and which you can live with and which you can fix.

 You'll need fishing line, a mouse trap, ring caps, tent pegs, nails, screws, and rubber bands., Use a drill to screw through the mousetrap onto the top half of the tent peg. Use a screwdriver and wood screws to screw them together., The bait pedal is the metal rectangle part that the mouse steps on to release the trap. Drill a hole behind it through the mouse trap. You'll tie a knot over the bait pedal later., If your pop caps are in a ring, cut out individual ones.One should fit over a small nail head.Instead of pop caps, you can use a glow stick., You need to see where it's hitting the wood when it releases., Where the bow hits the wood along the sides, drill a small hole on each side. Hammer a nail in each hole. The head of the nail should face the bow as it swings down. In other words, the bow should come down and hit the nail on the head when the trap releases.If you're using a glow stick, drill four holes. Tie the glow stick on so that the bow hits it when the trap releases., If you want to camouflage your trap, paint the mousetrap and the pegs to match the surroundings.You can also paint the tent pegs before you attach the mousetrap.
 Securely tie the line to the other tent peg. Hammer the peg into the ground., Make sure the wire is taut across the path. Run it into the back of the trap to the front, and tie it to the bait pedal., Rubber band the tripwire onto the peg and the mousetrap. The rubber band will secure the tripwire., Add a pop cap to each nail head. Pull the bow down to arm the trap., When the tripwire is triggered, the mousetrap will hit the pop caps, making a loud bang. It will tell if a person is walking in the area.If you used a glow stick, the glow stick will light up when hit.

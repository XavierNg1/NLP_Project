 Soon-to-be moms should always register for gifts for their baby showers. Many register at places such as Target or Walmart. Car seats, strollers, and other big items are important to register for, but there are also many people who would love to buy something for your little one but lack the money to purchase something pricey. Baby clothes are the perfect gift for people on a budget (which, let's face it, many of us are). Register for newborn clothes as well as clothes in 0-3 and 3-6 month sizes., Visit websites and blogs that are geared at new parents or do an Internet search for "baby clothing giveaways." There are many people and companies who are eager to help, especially if they think that doing so can promote their own store or blog. Some contests may give away clothes, while others will give away gift cards that can be used on clothes.In addition to looking for contests focused on providing baby supplies, you can also search for contests that have nothing to do with babies as long as the award includes a gift card to a department store or another store that sells baby clothes., If you're in a difficult financial situation and you cannot afford baby clothes, you may qualify to receive help from numerous charitable organizations. Church charities can be extremely helpful to individuals going through a rough time, and you may also be able to get free baby clothes from secular charities, as well. Look online to find the charities near you.Contact local community organizations for low-income or teen mothers. A Chamber of Commerce or town hall may be able to give you a list. These groups will give you used clothing that has been donated. When your baby outgrows them, you can pay it forward by donating them and other clothes back.

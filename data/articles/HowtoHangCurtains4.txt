 The length of a balloon curtain can be adjusted up or down, but the length isn't meant to be changed frequently so it's best to decide on the length you want before installing.


Lay the curtain face down on the floor; you'll see horizontal rows of rings sewn on the back of the shade. Use the split rings that came with the shades and slip one into each of the rings along the bottom-most row of the curtain. Now, slip each split ring onto the ring in the row above it. Repeat this process row by row until you get your curtain the length you want.
 Slide the rod through the rod pocket at the top of the curtain and spread the fabric out evenly across the rod. Mount the rod on the brackets and puff out the curtain from behind to create fullness.

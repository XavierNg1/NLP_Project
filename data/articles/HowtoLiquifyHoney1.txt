 If you want your honey to retain the benefits of “raw” honey, use the microwave with caution. While quick and efficient, microwaving can easily destroy the beneficial enzymes by overheating them.;
, Besides presenting a possible health hazard, plastic containers don't transfer heat as well as glass does. Bottom line: you'll get the job done quicker and more safely if you move your honey to a glass jar instead of using a plastic container.
 Cooking time for your batch will vary based on the amount of honey you’re liquefying, the starting temperature of the honey, and its sugar content as well as content the wattage of your microwave. It is best to start off at low power and use short microwave times. This may take more cycles and an extra minute or two, but you won't ruin the taste of the honey or inhibit the effectiveness of the good enzymes during the liquefaction process.


Experiment to find what works for you in your environment, but experiment cautiously. Above 100°F (38ºC), the flavor of honey is altered; above 120°F (49ºC), the beneficial enzymes in the honey start to break down and stop being effective.
 If pockets of honey have started to liquefy, stir the honey to help transfer the heat. If the honey hasn’t started to liquefy, continue microwaving in 30 second increments until some crystals start to liquefy.
 Continue until the honey has nearly liquefied, then stir until the process is complete.


If most of the honey has liquefied but some stubborn crystals remain, you may want to finish the job off manually by stirring the honey vigorously instead of continuing to heat it.

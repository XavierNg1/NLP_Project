 Hold your poodle’s paw by placing your hand around the cuff. Use a number 40 blade to clip the coat around your dog’s paws. Clip the hair around your dog’s toes, as well as the hair on top of the foot.When shaving the paws, use light pressure to avoid digging the blade into the skin.
 Similar to the cut between the eyes, clip an inverted “V” at the croup. The croup is the muscular area on your dog’s rump, i.e., before the onset of the tail. Then, clip a two to three inch band at the base of the tail. Make sure the band goes all the way around the tail.
 Use curved and straight shears to shape the rest of the coat. Use curved shears for curved lines and straight sheers for straight lines. Follow the natural lines of the dog’s body when shearing the coat. Use the shears to shape the hair on your poodle’s hips and legs (insides and outsides), rump, sides and undersides, front, and end of the tail.

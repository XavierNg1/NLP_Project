 Whip up a half cup (118 g) of glaze with only two ingredients: powdered sugar and milk. Pour 1.25 cups (160 g) of powdered sugar into a mixing bowl (160 grams). Stir in 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of milk until the mixture turns smooth., Give your glaze a little more flavor. First, stir 2 teaspoons (30 ml) of vanilla extract into your milk. Then pour the mixture into your sugar, tablespoon by tablespoon, stirring to mix as you do so., Use 1.25 tablespoons (18 ml) of butter or margarine for extra flavor and texture. Let it soften on the counter long enough so that it mixes more easily. This could take about 20-30 minutes. Alternatively, you could stick it in the microwave for 30 seconds to speed things up. Then stir it into the glaze until it mixes evenly., Use these recipes to dress up baked goods. Ice or drizzle doughnuts, cakes, cinnamon buns, pastries, or whatever your munchies crave.For a light drizzle, use a spoon to pour small, thin amounts at a time.For a heavier drizzle, use a liquid measuring cup or any other container with a pouring spout.
For a more artful drizzle or icing, pour the glaze into a squeezable icing bag.

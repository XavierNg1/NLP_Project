 As mentioned in the previous method, all fruits and vegetables should be washed beforehand to remove any dirt or pesticide residue. A nylon-bristled brush will make this quick and easy.
 Hold the thick top of the carrot using your non-dominant hand. The carrot should be positioned at a 45-degree angle to the cutting board.


Hold it in between your thumb and forefinger and then flip your hand over so your palm is facing the ceiling. Your hand is underneath the carrot, supporting it.
 If you donâ€™t own a vegetable peeler, a paring knife will get the job done. Just be careful not to peel too much of the meat off the carrot. A gentle scrape of the top will do.


Also be careful not to hurt yourself! Your non-dominant hand shouldn't come anywhere close to the blade's edge. Make sure your fingers are under and to the sides of the carrot, not risking getting cut.
 As you peel and peel, rotate the carrot to expose the raw skin that hasn't yet been peeled away. You should be able to shift it in your non-dominant hand without stopping the process.


Sometimes it's easy to miss the very top of the carrot near where your wrist is. If this is the case, just flip it over and take care of the base by holding the tip and resuming your technique.
 Then, discard those along with the peels into your garbage or compost pile.


Place the carrot on a separate plate and continue peeling until all of your carrots are peeled. Rinse each peeled carrot before use.

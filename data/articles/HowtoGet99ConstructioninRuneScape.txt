 Build crude chairs You are going to need 630 normal planks, and at least twice as many nails to build them, as at this level you will bend a lot of nails. You can build these by building a Parlour, and then choosing the chair hotspot and picking crude chairs.
 Build Oak Larders. You build these in the kitchen area. You can do these until level 74 if you would like, as it is slightly faster than the other method, however it is much more expensive to do it this way.
 Make mounted Cape of Legends. You need to have completed legends quest to get this. This is a very inexpensive way to get to 99, only requiring 3 teak planks and a cape of legends, however stocking up on these capes can take some time.
 Make Mahogany Tables. These are fairly expensive, requiring 6 mahogany planks. Build a dining room and put a table in. This method is the quickest until level 73.
 Flotsam pawnbrokers. These take the same amount of planks as the mahogany table, but you are able to make them significantly faster, almost doubling your exp rates.

 Chatting away with others can make long distances seem like a trip to the mailbox. Preoccupy each other and talk about things you would usually chat about on the phone or online. Don't let the conversion drift towards "Oh, my gosh that hill is huge.";

, What now? Try walking in a park or some place where you can enjoy the scenery. Change your routes so you don't get stuck looking at the same thing, again and again. Walk at different times of the day too. If you usually walk around mid-day, try taking a jog while the sun is setting in the evening.
 Just be sure that your cell phone plan will cover all minutes you may use up!

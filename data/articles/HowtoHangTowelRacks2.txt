 If you are using a stud, attach the bracket to the stud with wood screws. If you are not using a stud, drill a hole into the wall where you will place the bracket and anchor. Set the bracket into the hole.
 Guide the anchor through the bracket and into the wall.
 Use a screwdriver to secure the anchor into the wall. The flare on the anchor will open when you screw the anchor into the wall. The flare should be wider than the hole.
 Place the towel bar with one end at the bracket. Mark a line on the wall at the other end of the bar. Use a level to confirm that the line is straight.
, Place the first cap over the first bracket. Draw the cap to the bottom of the bracket.
 Place one end of the towel bar into the cap that is on the bracket.
 Place the second cap onto the free end of the towel bar. Position the second cap onto the second bracket. Draw the cap to the bottom of the bracket. Ensure that the towel bar stays attached to both caps while positioning them into the brackets.
 Confirm that the bar is level.


Your towel rack is ready to use.

 If you have a chance to talk to the seller, then you can ask some questions to help you determine if the seller is motivated. If the seller seems to have a timeline or financial motivation to sell the house, then the seller may be motivated. For example, a seller might mention a hardship, a divorce, or a small business investment that went bad. Those are all signals that the seller is motivated. Some good questions to ask include:Why are you selling the property?
Where are you going next?
When do you plan to move?
Have you done a lot of improvements on this house?
Have you spoken to other agents?

, If the seller is using an agent, then you can talk to the agent as well. The agent may be willing to answer your questions about the seller as well or drop clues about the seller. One of those clues might make it clear that the seller is motivated. Some good questions to ask the agent include:Why is the owner selling?
How soon does the owner hope to move?
Has the owner already found a new house?

, Sometimes, real estate is priced for a quick sale without being advertised as such. Check the asking price of the property against the value of other properties in the area. If the price is significantly lower, the owner is likely a motivated seller. You can probably come in at an even lower price and close the deal.


Check to see if the owner has lowered the asking price one or more times as well. If the house has been on the market for a while and the price has dropped, then this can also indicate that the seller is motivated.

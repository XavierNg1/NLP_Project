 It’s preferable to set the iron down on a surface other than the iron board, especially if you’re using a more manageable tabletop board. A silicon-based or heavy terry cloth pad will help you avoid setting the hot iron down on a surface that’s prone to scorching. It will also help ensure the iron won’t get knocked over accidentally., If you’ve set the hot iron on a table and need to locate it, reach carefully and slowly at a level slightly below the table. Feel for the cord, then grab hold of it softly and slowly to avoid pulling the iron off the table. Let the cord guide your hand up to the iron so you can find the handle and safely lift it., An ironing cable holder is a device that clips onto an ironing board or table on one end and, with the other, holds the cord away from your work area. This will help you avoid knocking the ironing over, accidentally ironing over the cord, or setting the iron down on the cord, which may cause it to fall. The clips that hold the cord in place will also make it easier to locate the cord without pulling the iron off of a surface.You can find cord holders online or at a home goods store.

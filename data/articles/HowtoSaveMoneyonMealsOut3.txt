 Red meat is notorious for being pricier than other types of meat like chicken or turkey. Try to avoid red meat or, instead, order cheaper cuts of meat when possible — like beef brisket or chicken thighs.Vegetarian options are also usually cheaper when dining out.
 Most restaurants serve portions that are way more than what one person needs for a single meal. And while it can be nice to have leftovers to take home, it’s also nice to have a cheaper bill in the restaurant.Split an entrée with the person you’re dining with so that you both save a little money.
Sometimes restaurants issue a charge for splitting an entrée, but it will still probably end up costing less than ordering a whole second meal.
You can also split appetizers, sides, and dessert with your dining companions.
 Drinks are always expensive at restaurants, especially if you’re considering an alcoholic beverage. One way to cut down seriously on your bill is by refraining from the fancy drinks, alcoholic or otherwise.Order water instead. Most restaurants (even fast food chains) will let you have water for free with your meal.

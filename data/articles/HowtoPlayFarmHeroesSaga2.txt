 Before you go on attacking the board by matching cropsies on it, analyze what’s in store for you first. Identify the different cropsies and items available and how they all relate to each other and your goals for the level.
 Most goals will require you to collect certain number of cropsies. You need to match similar cropsies with at least three in a row or column to collect them. Swap cropsies on the board in order to get your matches. Match four or more similar cropsies in one go to get more bonuses.
 You can multiply the cropsies you collect by adding bonuses or multipliers to them. Matches made beside cropsies will increase their multipliers. Match cropsies with multipliers to collect them. Be sure to collect cropsies with high multipliers before moving to a match elsewhere so that you won’t lose them.
 Do not simply match any similar cropsies. You will just be wasting your moves on them. Focus on the ones that add to your goals. Save your moves so that you can get more points when you enter Hero Mode later on.
 If your level has space in the bottom, focus your matches in this area. There’s a likely chance that you will get cascading matches made by cropsies falling from the top.

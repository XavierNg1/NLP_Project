,, Do you want the primal reversion of Groudon or Kyogre? Look up the special events available for the game, and think about which ones you want most.
 Did you play the original games? If you did, which one did you like best? And if you only played one, why not give the other a whirl?

,, Discuss who is getting which game and why. Pay attention to each argument presented. Notice the points people have for choosing either Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire.
 For example, Reshiram is exclusive to Omega Ruby, while Zekrom is exclusive to Alpha Sapphire. You can check out the exclusives here: http://ie.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-omega-ruby-alpha-sapphire/Version_Differences

, Choose the Pokémon you prefer.
 If you cannot come to a conclusion, give yourself to the spontaneous moment, and choose as you go to buy it.
 If you have no idea what to do and you think the games are perfectly equal, flip a coin.
 Don't get all down if you pick the wrong one; just remember you will have fun either way!

, You get both Rayquaza and Deoxys, along with many other legendary Pokémon. Which one you choose is up to you.
 This may not seem like a big deal, but if you have friends that also play, it's always fun to have a common enemy.
 If so, it's nice to get the remake of the one you originally had or your favorite out of the three if you had Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald. Why not get a fun remake of your childhood memories?

,,, Each individual Pokémon has a different way of battling!

, If a friend already has Omega Ruby, consider getting Alpha Sapphire. That way, you can trade Pokémon you each need.

 One of the most common causes of fighting among married couples is money, and this doesn’t change during the holidays. In fact, it can become worse.


Make a budget you are both comfortable with before you go shopping and commit to it. Not arguing about your finances during the holidays can prevent extra stress and help you stay connected., Your spouse may appreciate an expensive watch the first time it is placed on their wrist, but chances are, by this time next year, it will be forgotten. Spending those resources on sharing experiences together, however, will likely create lifelong memories. Doing things together as a family will also have a positive effect on your kids, which in turn, can make you and your spouse closer.


Spend your money on tickets to an amusement park that features light displays, or check out a critically-acclaimed holiday show. These experiences are much more gratifying than material objects, and allow you and your spouse to spend quality time together., The holidays aren’t about who can buy the most expensive presents. They are about spending time with those you love the most. Spending money you can’t afford on presents will only strain your relationship with your spouse. Instead, make presents that your loved ones will appreciate. Doing this with your spouse can create a happy memory and won’t break the bank.


Creating handmade holiday cards, clothing, or crafts, or giving your friends or loved ones pictures of you and your family are cost-effective and meaningful presents that can be treasured for years, and make just as much of an impact as gifts you spend a lot of money on.

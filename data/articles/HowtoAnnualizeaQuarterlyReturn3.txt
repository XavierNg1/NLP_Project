 You may have a new investment and want to know the Annual Rate of Return based on a number of days, not months. Let's say you have held the investment for 17 days and earned 2.13%.
 In this case to calculate the exponent to use, you will divide 17 (the number of days you held the investment) by 365 (the number of days in a year). The answer is .0465753.


Convert 2.13% interest rate to a decimal by dividing 2.13 by 100 = .0213.
Your formula will look like this: ((1+0.0213)^1/.0465753) â€“ 1 = Annual Rate of Return. ((1.0213)^21.4706078)-1 = 1.5722717 - 1 = .5722717. Convert this to a percentage by multiplying this by 100 = 57.23% annual rate of return.
 You can't assume that just because you earned 2.13% in a number of days or months that you will be able to earn that same amount the rest of the year. Stock earnings go up and down every day but you will be able to make a general projection.

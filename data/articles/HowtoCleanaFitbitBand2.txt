 Take the dry cloth and use it to clear off the surface of the band. For lingering debris, slightly dampen the cloth. Make sure it isn’t dripping, since leather isn’t water-resistant., Pass a dry microfiber cloth over the entire band to remove excess moisture. Any moisture left on the band will seep into it and cause damage to the leather., Don’t place the band in direct sunlight, heat, or high humidity, as any of these will damage the band. Leave it in a cool, shaded spot until it feels dry to the touch., First, test the conditioner in a small spot. Place a small amount on a cotton ball or cotton sock and rub it on the leather. Wait a few minutes, and if the leather isn’t discolored, use the same method to cover the rest of the band. Do this twice a year.A leather conditioner such as Meltonian cleans the band but also protects it from further stains.

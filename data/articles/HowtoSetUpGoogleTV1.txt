 The box should include the Logitech Revue Companion Box, the Logitech Keyboard Controller, power cord and power supply, IR mini blaster, and HDMI cable.;
,


Connect the included HDMI cable from the “HDMI In” port on your Logitech companion box to your set top box (STB). (Your setup box is typically the hardware used to receive your digital cable subscription).

Also connect the power cable from the companion box’s “Power” port to your wall outlet or power source.

Connect the HDMI cable from your box’s “HDMI Out” port to the HDMI port on your HDTV. If you want to use an Audio-Video Receiver (AVR), connect the HDMI cable from the “HDMI Out” port on the companion box to the HDMI port on your AVR. You can then connect your TV via an HDMI cable from the “HDMI Out” port on your AVR to the “HDMI In” port on your TV.

You can optionally connect the companion box to an internet modem via the “Ethernet” port using an Ethernet cable. Alternatively, you can use a Wi-Fi connection using a local network.
 Also slide the power switch on your Logitech Keyboard Controller to “ON”.

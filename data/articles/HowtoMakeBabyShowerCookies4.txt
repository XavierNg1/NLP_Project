Don’t worry about making extra icing. Keeping some extra icing on-hand will ensure that you have it available if you make any mistakes.
Expect to decorate about 1 dozen cookies per cup of royal icing. This will vary depending on whether you are creating a simple design, like piping letters, or whether you are covering the cookie with a decorative image.

Use food coloring made from gel or powder. This will ensure that your royal icing doesn’t thin out.
Always start with a small amount of coloring. For instance, stick a toothpick in gel food coloring and mix it into your icing rather than squeezing the gel into the bowl. You can always add more later to get the desired color.


A #3 tip is good for outlining; the other tips that you use will depend on the nature of the design.
If you’re unsure of what a tip does, then test the tip by piping some icing onto a piece of aluminum foil before you pipe icing onto the cookies.
 This should only take a few minutes., The icing should have the consistency of cold honey when you’ve added enough water.,, After you have mostly filled in the design, use a toothpick to smooth out the icing.,,

 Place ½ of an avocado and a whole, peeled banana into a medium sized bowl. Use a fork to mash the two ingredients together. Continue to mash them with your fork until they are evenly mixed together.If your hair is very long, you may need to double all of the ingredients to end up with enough mask.;
, Measure out the almond milk, pure maple syrup and olive oil and put each into the bowl with the mashed avocado and banana mixture. Stir all five ingredients together with a spoon until they are completely mixed together.Be sure to use pure, real maple syrup. Other syrups are filled with high-fructose corn syrup and will not have the same effect on your hair., Use your fingers to scoop up some of the mask mixture and start applying it to your hair. Work it through with your fingers. Continue until you’ve spread the mask all over your hair. Run a wide-toothed comb through your hair to ensure the mask is evenly distributed.You can apply the mask to damp or dry hair.
 Make sure you’ve fully covered your hair with the mask mixture. Use a few clips to twist your hair up and out of your face. As the mask dries, your hair will start to feel slightly crunchy. This is normal.Put a shower cap on over your hair if you’re worried about getting the mask on your clothing or furniture.
 Hop in the shower to rinse the mask from your hair. You will need to shampoo the mask out – plain water won’t get all of it out. Make sure you use a natural, nourishing shampoo. If you use a regular shampoo, which includes chemicals and sulfates, it will strip your hair of the nutrients provided by the mask.After shampooing, condition your hair as you normally would.
Use this mask on dry and damaged hair every two weeks for best results.

 This Pokémon should know moves that lower your opponents' stats, cause status ailments, boost your team's stats, change the weather to your advantage, etc. For example, you could have a Forretress with Toxic Spikes, Stealth Rock, Gyro Ball, and Payback. A good set-up Pokémon can help on both Offensive and Stall teams.;
, This Pokémon doesn't need to be strong when it comes to Attack or Speed and is more of a support Pokémon than a fighter. A good example is Skarmory, who heal instantly with Roost and support your team with Spikes.
 Powerful sweepers like Dragon Dance Gyarados can bring down entire teams if played correctly. Stall is common, so a good mixed sweeper like Infernape or Salamence can benefit your team.
 Snorlax has much higher Attack than Special Attack, so use physical moves. Lapras, on the other hand, has equal base Attack and Special Attack, so it can utilize Physical and Special moves accordingly.
 All your Pokémon don't necessarily have to be designated fighters; a few supporting Pokémon wouldn't hurt. Blissey can help your team absorb Special Attacks and heal with Wish, Softboiled or Aromatherapy. Hippowdon can be a huge help on a Stall team since its ability Sand Stream summons a Sandstorm, which can wear down Pokémon.
 Having all Steel types is all good and well until your opponent sends out an Blaziken. In Double Battles, a good duo can go a long way. The combined efforts of Skarmory and Blissey is famous for its ability to take physical and special attacks.
 Focus Sashes, Berries, and Leftovers are a good place to start if you want to focus on boosting your Pokémon's stats. However, the Flame Orb-Facade combination can work in your favor, as well as the Toxic Orb-Switcheroo combo.
 Certain Natures lower certain stats. The Adamant Nature boosts Attack, but lowers Special Attack, for example.
 If you find that a Pokémon isn't working well with the rest of your team, by all means, get a different one instead!

 To keep your skin looking young, use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 every day. This UV protection will help to prevent fine lines, age spots, and skin discoloration. Opt for a lotion or moisturizer with broad spectrum protection, meaning that it will prevent skin damage from both UVA and UVB rays.Apply sunscreen to bare skin at least 15 minutes before going outdoors.Purchase a lip balm with SPF to protect your lips from sun damage.Always apply makeup after applying sunscreen.;
, If you buy an all-purpose moisturizer with SPF in it, purchase a separate moisturizing cream for to apply generously to your bare face before bed, when you will not need UV protection. Get advice from a product consultant at a beauty supply store or research online reviews to choose a moisturizer that is right for your skin. Look for ingredients that target you specific skin type, such as:Ceramides, glycerin, and mineral oil for dry skin
Lavender oil, rose oil, or green tea extract for sensitive skin
Hyaluronic acid or glycerin for oily or combination skin

, Retinoids, derivatives of vitamin A, increase your skin' s production of collagen and regulate skin cells, leaving skin looking more youthful. Buy a mild retinoid cream from a department store or beauty supply store, or visit a dermatologist to get a prescription for a stronger retinoid treatment. Prescription retinoids may be rougher on skin for the first few weeks of use (e.g., causing redness or peeling skin), but will ultimately produce faster and more noticeable results.Ease into using retinoid creams or lotions by applying a pea-sized amount at night for 2-3 nights before using it as you normally would a day or night moisturizer. If the formula is too harsh for your skin, try a milder formula of retinoid moisturizer.

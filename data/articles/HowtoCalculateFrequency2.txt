 The formula for the frequency of a wave in a vacuum is almost identical to that of a wave not in a vacuum. Since there are no outside influences on the velocity of the wave, though, you would use the mathematical constant for the speed of light, which electromagnetic waves would travel at under these conditions. As such, the formula is written as: f = C / 位


In this formula, f represents frequency, C represents the velocity or speed of light, and 位 represents the wavelength of the wave.
Example: A particular wave of electromagnetic radiation has a wavelength of 573 nm when passing through a vacuum. What is the frequency of this electromagnetic wave?

, When the problem gives you the wavelength in meters, no further action is needed. If, however, the wavelength is given in micrometers, you need to convert this value into meters by dividing it by the number of micrometers in a single meter.


Note that when working with extremely small numbers or extremely large numbers, it is generally easier to write the values in scientific notation. The values will be shown in and out of their scientific notation forms for this example, but when writing your answer for homework, other schoolwork, or other formal forums, you should stick with scientific notation.
Example: 位 = 573 nm

573 nm x (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 5.73 x 10^-7 m = 0.000000573



, Divide this value by the wavelength converted into meters.


Example: f = C / 位 = 3.00 x 10^8 / 5.73 x 10^-7 = 5.24 x 10^14

, With this, you should have calculated the value of the frequency of the wave. Write your answer in Hertz, Hz, the unit for frequency.


Example: The frequency of this wave is 5.24 x 10^14 Hz.

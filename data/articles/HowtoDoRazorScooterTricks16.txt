 You can also find a small ledge but make sure you can bunny hop into pogo that high.
 The more speed the better, but make sure its not to much or you will flip onto your back if you manual.
 Do not hop over the ledge or surface.
 As you land, pull back into a manual but keep your foot slammed on the brake. If you find a good surface you will start to slide. However, if you don't land it the first time it doesn't mean that it's a bad surface. if you feel it slide the slightest bit keep at it.

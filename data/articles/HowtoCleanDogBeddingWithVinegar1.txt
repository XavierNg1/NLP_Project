 Add 1/2 cup (120 ml) of white vinegar to the softener dispenser of the machine. Start the wash cycle. If your machine does not have a softener dispenser, run the machine as usual and add the vinegar at the beginning of the final rinse cycle.If the smell on your dog's bedding is especially strong, add a full cup of vinegar to the final rinse cycle.
 If possible, hang your dog's bedding on a clothesline to dry - the outdoor air will help with neutralizing odors and freshen the bedding. If line drying is not an option, air dry the items indoors or use the clothes dryer. If you choose the latter option, be sure to clean out the lint trap carefully afterwards to remove all pet hair.Avoid using dryer sheets, which may irritate your dog's skin.
 After washing your dog's bedding in the washing machine, clean the machine to remove any lingering odors or pet hair. Add a 1/2 cup of chlorine bleach. Run a full hot water wash cycle.

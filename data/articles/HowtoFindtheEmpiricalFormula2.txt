 If you are trying to find the empirical formula for a homework assignment, you will most likely be given the percentage composition—you just need to know where to look. For example:


Let’s say that the assignment asks you to look at a sample of vitamin C. It lists 40.92% Carbon, 4.58% hydrogen 54.5% Oxygen—this is the percent composition.
40.92% of the vitamin C is made up of carbon, while the rest is made up of 4.58% hydrogen and 54.5% oxygen.
 As discussed in Part 1, the equation for finding the number of gram atoms is: The percent of the element in the compound (%) divided by the element’s atomic mass. For our example, the atomic mass of carbon is 12, hydrogen is 1 and oxygen is 16.


Number of gram atoms of carbon = 40.92 / 12 = 3.41
Number of gram atoms of hydrogen = 04.58 / 01 = 4.58
Number of gram atoms of oxygen = 54.50 / 16 = 3.41

, Look for the gram atom that is the smallest of all of the gram atoms that we just calculated. For our example, this is 3.41 (carbon or oxygen—they both have the same value). You must then divide all of the gram atom values by this number. You write the ratio like this: value Carbon : value Hydrogen : value Oxygen.


Carbon: 3.41 / 3.41 = 1
Hydrogen: 4.58 / 3.41 = 1.34
Oxygen: 3.41 / 3.41 = 1
The atomic ratio is 1 : 1.34 : 1.
 If your atomic ratio has whole numbers you can skip this step. For our example, however, we have to convert 1.34 to a whole number. Our smallest whole number that can be multiplied with the numbers in our atomic ratio to create whole numbers is 3.


1 x 3 = 3 (this works because 3 is a whole number).
1.34 x 3 = 4 (4 is also a whole number).
1 x 3 = 3 (again, 3 is a whole number).
Our whole number ratio is therefore Carbon(C) : Hydrogen(H) : Oxygen(O) = 3 : 4 : 3


, To do this, all you have to do is write the letters of each component, in this case C for carbon, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen, with their whole number counter parts as subscripts. The empirical formula for our example is:


C3H4O3

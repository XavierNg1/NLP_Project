 (See the Things You'll Need section below). Set them out to make sure you have everything ready. When obtaining the items, consider the following:


Reuse and recycle. Use a piece of lace off of an old piece of clothing that has ripped or is just old and needs to be retired. Whatever piece of lace you choose, make sure it can spread from one side of the shirt across to the other, measuring horizontally across the shirt.
Use any old solid colored shirt. Think ahead and decide in advance what color you want to spray paint. The colors should complement each other if you want it to look good. Keep in mind that opposite colors attract, dark colors look good on light colors, and dark colors work well with neons.

 Write down anything about your health that may seem strange or abnormal. Make another list of all medications, vitamins, and supplements you take. Finally, write a list of questions you have for the doctor. For example, you might want to know:


What is the best treatment for this illness?
Are treatments generally successful?
Are there any side effects of treatment?

, The first step in fighting oral thrush is to see a doctor. The doctor will probably be able to identify thrush with a simple visual examination of your throat, but he or she may need to scrape throat tissue with a cotton swab and examine the tissue under a microscope.Other examinations might include:


A blood test, in which your blood is drawn and then analyzed for related conditions like abnormally high blood sugar.
An endoscopic exam. If you have extensive disease or if it is difficult to treat, then you might be referred to an ENT doctor who can do a limited scope of your mouth and throat or to a gastroenterologist who would do a scope of your esophagus and stomach.
 Medication prescribed by a qualified medical doctor is the standard treatment.Your doctor might prescribe pills, a medicated mouthwash solution, or antifungal lozenges.


Take your medication exactly as prescribed. If you do not treat your oral thrush properly, the condition could develop into invasive candidiasis, a fungal infection that occurs when the fungus enters the blood. Once it becomes blood-borne, the infection will spread throughout the body.
Contact your doctor if your oral thrush is not responding to treatment. You may need to get a fungal culture to find out more about the specific nature of the candida fungus youâ€™re infected with.

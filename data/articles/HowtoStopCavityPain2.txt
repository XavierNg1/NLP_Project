 You may be experiencing pain in your cavity after you eat. This might be due to food being stuck in the cavity. To help relieve the pain, rinse your mouth with warm water. Then, use a toothpick to gently and carefully get any food out of the cavity.Make sure not to poke too deep into the cavity because you could cause more damage to the tooth or gums.
 Rinsing your mouth with warm salt water is one of the most effective ways to help reduce pain in the mouth. Saltwater can help reduce acids in your gums, which may be leading to irritation and pain.Stir in a tablespoon of salt into a glass of warm or lukewarm water until dissolved. Rinse with the solution, making sure to swish it around the sore gum and tooth.
 Another way to help cavity pain is to use an ice pack. Place some ice cubes or crushed ice into a towel, balloon, or the cut-off finger of a non-latex glove to make an ice pack. Place the ice pack on the tooth if it isnâ€™t sensitive to cold.You can also place the ice pack on your face just over the painful area.
You can also use an ice pack that you buy in the store instead of making one yourself.
Make sure that you wrap the ice pack in a cloth or paper towel before you use it.
You can leave the ice pack on for about 10 to 15 minutes. Then, remove it and give your skin a chance to return to its normal temperature.
 Hydrogen peroxide can help remove bacteria in the cavity and clean the area to help reduce infection. Swish your mouth with a 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide. Keep it in your mouth for up to a minute.Spit it out and make sure not to swallow this solution.
Avoid using hydrogen peroxide solution for more than five days in a row or your teeth will get sensitive.

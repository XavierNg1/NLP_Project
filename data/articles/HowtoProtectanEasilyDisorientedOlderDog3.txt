 If you have stairs in your home, your older dog could accidentally fall down the stairs if it doesn’t know where it’s going. Stairs can be very problematic if your dog has seizures, since dogs become very disoriented after seizures and could take a tumble on the stairs.Block your dog's access to the stairs by placing a baby gate at the stairs.
 When your dog gets disoriented, it could walk through an open door or climb through a window without being fully aware of what it's doing. If your dog manages to get outside, it could wander off into a dangerous situation.


Protect your dog by making sure it can't get through any windows or doors.
 Older dogs commonly get vestibular disease, which causes sudden disorientation and wobbliness for a few days. If your dog has suddenly become very disoriented, take it your vet, who can make a vestibular disease diagnosis and prescribe a sedative to help your dog relax.

, Place the nori on a flat surface. Lay the salmon slices on first, half on and half off the end nearest you. Spread a thin layer of the specially prepared sushi rice over half of the nori, ensuring that the rice is stuck without mashing the kernels.
 Tear the tails off the shrimp and split them in two. Lay the avocado in the middle of the rice, along with the crab, shrimp, and salmon.
 Fold the nori inside the rolling mat. Then apply some pressure to shape the maki. Make sure the salmon is neatly tucked in, then apply more pressure. With the salmon strip facing up, continue to shape the roll.
 To ensure a smooth cut, dip the end of your knife in water. Trim off the rough ends and slice in half. Place the 2 pieces next to each other and cut into 6 even sized portions.
 Arrange the bite size portions on a serving plate with the salmon strips facing up. Carefully spoon a little roe on top of each piece. Finish off with a dusting of sesame seeds. When making the sushi, the look of the food is crucial.

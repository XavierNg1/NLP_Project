, You will be taken to an eye-catching website where you can learn all about the what, why, and how of ISBN numbers, which you are free to peruse as long as your eyes can handle it.


For our purposes, we will jump right to getting an ISBN.
 This takes you to another page with a little more information about ISBNs. Feel free to peruse that at your leisure, or go directly to their ISBN purchase page.


From here, you can buy as many ISBN numbers as you think you will need.

Important: you will need a separate ISBN for each version of the book you publish. That includes hard cover, paperbacks, ePubs, PDFs, apps, and second editions.
 You can buy the ISBN before you need it, and when it's time to publish, log on to the Agency website and fill out the form and the information.


Note that this information is for the U.S. ISBN agency. Prices and procedures will vary depending on your region. If you're not in the U.S., the first step will take you where you need to go.

 Campylobacteriosis is found in the gut and common in puppies six months and younger. Nearly half of dogs carry the disease. People can get the disease if they have unhygienic contact with an infected animal., The bacteria is found in the gastrointestinal tract. Any dog who carries the bacteria can spread it through his feces. Kennels are the most common place dogs can contract this disease.Dogs can contract the disease by ingesting feces, or through contaminated food and water.


Dogs can also contact the disease by walking across ground covered in feces and then licking their paws.This is why it is important to pick up your dog’s feces from the ground, since coming into contact with the infected feces can spread it.
There is a small risk that campylobacter can be contracted through raw meats, such as chicken. You can spread it to the dog by touching water or food after handling raw meat., When you take the dog to the vet, your vet will take a stool sample. Then, the vet will send a stool sample to the lab to be analyzed.She can also do blood and urine tests. The vet will also consider the dog’s individual case and decide if he has campylobacter.
 Only a few antibiotics can kill campylobacter. If you use these antibiotics when they aren’t needed, you can create antibiotic resistance.


This might mean that the treatment for people can be less effective because the strains of campylobacter can become resistant in dogs if they are given antibiotics when they don’t need it.Make sure your vet is absolutely sure that the dog has campylobacter before giving it antibiotics to avoid resistance.

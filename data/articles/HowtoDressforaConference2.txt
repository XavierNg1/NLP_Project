 Khaki pants are just about as dressy as you need to be for a casual conference. Look for trouser-style pants with wide legs, and keep the material pressed and free of wrinkles.
 Light and medium washes may look too casual, so the darker the wash, the better. Stick with a trouser-style leg and avoid styles that sag at the waist or taper past the knee.
 Pencil and A-line skirts work best, but you can play with the color and pattern more than you could at a professional conference. Avoid extravagant embellishments and stick for conservative "Sunday best" skirts.
 Stick with solid colors and avoid crazy patterns. Traditional button-down shirts also work well.
 Cotton, knit, and silk blouses look especially nice. You can opt for a button-down blouse or choose one that slips on over your head.
 Instead of a separate top and bottom, women can also consider a solid dress. Choose one in a work-appropriate style. Generally, this means that the dress has a solid print, conservative neckline, and knee-length hem.
 Black and brown loafers work well for guys. Sneakers are too casual and must be avoided.
 Women have a little more room to play around with their shoe for a casual conference, but you should still opt for a closed-toe style with a relatively low heel. Feel free to play with color and texture, however.
 Black, brown, gray, and tan socks work best. Avoid white socks or socks with patterns.
 For extremely casual settings, pantyhose many not be necessary at all. It still would not be a bad idea to carry them, however. If you realize later that they are not necessary, you can slip them off.
 Even at a casual conference, accessories should still be unobtrusive and simple.
 The required dress code for meal functions can vary. Luncheons may only require business casual dress, but most evening receptions require you to dress up. Women should opt for conservative cocktail dresses and men should go with a suit and tie.

 Stain removers such as OxiClean and Resolve are readily available at grocery and drug stores. These are designed to remove tough stains like ink, dirt, and other stains.


Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions when using these products.
 Try to soak up any excess ink with an old towel or cloth. Dab gently to try to lift up the ink. Keep turning the cloth over to a fresh side so you don’t transfer any excess ink back onto the carpet.
 Put a small amount of the cleaning product on an inconspicuous spot on the carpet. Rinse the carpet and let it dry.


If your carpet is colorfast, there shouldn’t be a problem using a carpet cleaning product. If your carpet is not colorfast, however, the cleaning product might remove color from the carpet fibers.
 Following the instructions on the cleaner’s packaging, apply cleaner to the stain. Let the cleaner sit for 1-5 minutes to soak into the stain and to allow it to work on dissolving the ink.


If you are using OxiClean, mix some of the powder with water to make a paste. Follow the instructions on the package for the correct proportions., Choose a cloth that you don’t mind getting stained, since the ink will transfer to this cloth. Blot gently by pressing the cloth into the stained area. Do not rub it around or scrub, as this can spread the stain.


Keep turning the cloth over to a fresh surface so that you are not transferring ink back onto the carpet., Use lukewarm water to rinse the carpet thoroughly. Dip an old clean cloth into a bowl of water and wring out some of the excess water. Dab this cloth on the cleaned stain area to help rinse the carpet.


You may need to do this rinsing process several times to fully remove the stain remover.
 Leave the carpet overnight to give it time to dry. Turn up the heat in the room to help speed up the drying process. Vacuum the rug to remove any excess cleaning debris.

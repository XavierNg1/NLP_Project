 Some sticky substances, like hot glue or gum, become very brittle when they are frozen. Put the fabric in the freezer until the sticky substance is completely frozen. This method works better with gum and glue-like substances rather than stickers or sticky substances that have seeped into the fabric.You can put the garment into a freezer safe plastic bag as long as the sticky substance does not touch the bag.You can freeze any type of fabric without damaging it.
 Once the sticky substance is frozen, remove the garment from the freezer. Immediately begin to scrape the substance off with a flat butter knife or an old credit card. The frozen glue should pop off and detach from the fabric.


You may be able to use your fingernails to pry off the gum as well.
 If freezing the sticky substance didn't remove all of the residue, use another method to remove the remaining stain. Try using heat or an adhesive removal product to remove the remaining stickiness.


Once the stain is fully removed, you can wash the garment.

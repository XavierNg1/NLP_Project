 You can use a kicking pad or a kicking target specifically for Taekwondo that you can buy. You can also use a stiff or folded piece of paper as your target or an X-ray paper.









If you don’t have a partner to work with and want a target, you can make one yourself using a nail, string, tennis ball and a small plastic sandwich bag. Place the ball in the bag, then use the string to tie the bag closed being sure to leave a few extra feet of string. Drive the nail into a ceiling or, if you can't kick over 5 1⁄2 feet (1.7 m), a door frame will work. Tie the string from the bag to the nail in the ceiling so that it hangs down about 6 inches (15.2 cm) lower than you can kick.
 Do not try be fast or put too much power into the kick, just make sure your kick motion is perfect. Hit the target, but focus more on the motion and less on the power.
, When you kick movements are once again perfect at the new speed, increase the speed a little more.
 But make sure your movements remain exact.









When training to increase your speed or power, don’t forget about the accuracy. Accuracy is as important as the speed.
 Ask a friend to hold up a his or her fist or just hold a smaller target, such as a piece of paper at different heights for you to kick.
 Since you need to bring up your knee for some kicks, speeding up this motion will improve your speed as well. Practice pulling your knee faster to increase speed.
 Practice sliding and stepping into the kick. If the lead in to the kick is faster, it will give you momentum to kick faster as well. Incorporation of fast footwork and the kick will increase your overall speed.
 Practice quickly stepping away from the target after you kick.
 If you keep your weight on the front of your feet, you’ll be able to move faster versus if you keep your weight on your heels.

 Some people say that Microsoft Paint is really all you need (which definitely is if your making simple ones, or your not a 'serious' doller), but some say you need special software. It's best to use a cheap or free program such as Paint or Gimp when you're beginning. Start by using pre-made bases until you're more skilled.


When dolling you can make the proportions as unrealistic or as realistic as you like, but just make sure you only draw things one pixel at a time, rather then quickly scribbling a picture.;

Don't copy what someone else made by changing the color or snatching the outline and call it your own. Not only is it wrong, but where's the feeling of accomplishment?
If you used someone's base, give proper credit. Include the base and a link. You could otherwise get in trouble for copyright.

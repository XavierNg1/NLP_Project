 Birds are social animals that enjoy time outside. Furthermore, one important sign of illness is lethargy. To monitor whether your bird is sick, you need to see how it responds to physical activity. If you bird seems lethargic or does not respond to stimuli, there might be an underlying issue.When you do play with your bird, make sure that it does not breath heavily afterward. Breathing should appear effortless. It should not be breathing through an open mouth, or exhibit tail bobbing when it inhales.Sometimes your bird will be lethargic because it has not gotten enough rest. If you see that it gets sleep and is still tired afterward, you should be concerned., A bird that sits on the bottom of the cage might have balance issues. Watch to see if it seems to mostly be leaning on one of its legs to the exclusion of the other.These can be signs of injury., Any change in personality could reflect an underlying issue. Watch to see if an otherwise friendly bird no longer wants to socialize, if an active bird seems lethargic, or if a calm bird seems agitated.It is particularly common for a sick bird to become more aggressive with other birds., One sign of dangerous lethargy is increased sleepiness. Be mindful if your bird is sleeping at unusual hours or has its eyes partially closed.How much and when a bird sleeps can vary significantly even within a species. Pet parrots, for example, have very different schedules from one household to another. However, schedules should be consistent. If your bird has begun sleeping during a time of day in which it is normally awake, that is a cause for concern., A bird that is sick will be less likely to vocalize or sing than a bird that is healthy. If your bird isn’t as talkative as normal, be attentive to its other behavior, because something might be wrong.It is also possible that your bird’s voice might begin to sound different if it is sick.

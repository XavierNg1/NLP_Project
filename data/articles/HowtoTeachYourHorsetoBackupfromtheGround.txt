 Give him plenty of slack in the rope---about 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) is best to start with.;
, Beginning very gently, start shaking the lead rope from side to side. Watch your horse's reaction. If he so much as lifts his head, immediately stop shaking and praise him.
 Increase the shaking according to your horse's resistance while you continue to watch his reaction. The minute he shows a sign of yielding, such as raising his head, stop shaking and praise him.
 Stop shaking as soon as you get a response from your horse, whether it's a lifted head or a step back.
 It is very important, however, that you do not rush the learning process, and be sure to reward your horse's efforts by stopping the shaking and giving verbal praise.

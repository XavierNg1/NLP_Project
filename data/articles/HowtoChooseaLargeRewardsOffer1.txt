 For example, a company may offer you 20,000 "points" just to open an account with them. If you're interested in the offer, take note of the expiration date, and sign up before that date. Keep the offer on file for future reference.


A "point" usually means one cent. In this example, you would multiply 20,000 by .01 to get $200. The credit card company is offering $200 as a sign-up bonus.;
, Let's say the annual fee is $80. Subtracting $80 from $200 leaves you just $120 from that sign-up bonus.

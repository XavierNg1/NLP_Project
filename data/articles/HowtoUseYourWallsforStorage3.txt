 Choose a ladder with plank steps as opposed to rungs. Push the ladder up to the wall, keeping it far enough away from the door for the door to open. Use two small L brackets screwed to the wall and the sides of the ladder to keep it in place.The planks of the ladder function as shelves.
Use the ladder to store shoes, car keys, mail, or other things that pile up on flat surfaces.
 At the store, buy suction cups with hooks. Nail them to the wall near your front door, about one foot off of the ground. Use these to hang shoes that clutter the floor of the doorway.This is great as an organizational tool because it gets the shoes up off of the floor.
The basic setup can be moved to any room of the house as a way for extra storage. Nail the hooks higher up on the wall for things other than shoes.
 Go to a craft store or any big-box store and buy some cork boards or cork panels. Nail them by the front door to leave messages, in the kitchen for receipts or reminders, or in the laundry room for the laundry schedule. Stick extra tacks in the cork for new additions.The benefit of cork boards is that itâ€™s easy to take things down and pin new things up. They work great for collecting the various scraps of paper that always accumulate around the house.

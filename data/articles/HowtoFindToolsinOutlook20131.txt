 Traditional menus are a thing of the past in Outlook 2013, and nearly all of the functions you used to access through them can now be found in the tabs along the top of the screen.


Some tabs may only be available when specific windows are open. For example, the Messages tab will appear when you compose a new message.
 You can switch between Mail, Calendar, People, and Tasks by clicking their buttons at the bottom of the screen.


The functions in your tabs will change depending on which view you are using. For example, the Home tab will look different for Mail than for Calendar.

 If you feel a little uncertain about where to begin, start by selecting a nice, simple headband in a solid color. Many patterns still look sophisticated, but solid colors are generally more versatile and work for more occasions than many patterns.
 Think black, brown, gray, beige, white, muted gold, or muted silver. A neutral colored headband is subdued enough for more conservative settings, like businesses and conferences, but sophisticated enough to make you look clean and well put together.
 Baby blues, rose petal pinks, lavenders, and buttercup yellows have a delicate, feminine aura that aids in creating a sophisticated look.
 Look for plastic headbands with mock-lace designs, or fabric headbands with a soft floral or muted argyle print. Stick with patterns meant to evoke a sense of grace or class, and look for subdued hues.
 For example, a lime green headband or a one with hot pink flames will probably not evoke the sense of sophistication you were hoping for. Use your discretion to determine what colors and patterns might be too bold.
 If you prefer stronger colors, look for a cloth headband made of silk, satin, or a similarly glossy material. This adds a level of elegance to the headband that offsets the boldness of the color or pattern. For instance, a plastic leopard print headband will probably not look very sophisticated, but a silk leopard print headband might.

 There are many, many, many soil mixes for Nepenthes, which one you choose is pure preference and experience as to which produces the best results. Orchid bark, perlite, pumice, peat, long-fibered sphagnum moss (be careful when buying this stuff, make sure it's real moss and not decorative), charcoal, tree-fern fiber, are all good ingredients. Be careful when repotting as the roots are delicate. One reason not to choose long-fibered sphagnum is because it tends to cling to the roots.
 The flowers are either male or female, and they typically appear after the plant has made a climbing or scrambling vine. They don't change. If you find that it is in fact, for example, a male, then the next flower stalk is going to be male. It is a male plant. It can't be changed. Female flowers have a rather bulgy cit in the middle, whereas on the male flower is is thinner and yellow pollen is visible. To get an idea of this, look on Google images, there is a picture somewhere that shows the differences. On many of the carnivorous plant forums, there have been projects set up that let you trade pollen with other members of the forum, and when there are seeds, you get an equal share of them. An overall good idea.

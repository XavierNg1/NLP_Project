 If there is a couch available, this will often be the most comfortable option after a bed, as you will be able to stretch out. You'll want to make sure you have enough room to sleep comfortably, and you'll want to make sure your head isn't resting at an odd angle because of the couch's arm rests., Recline at a 135-degree angle. Anywhere from 135 to 150 is highly recommended for easing back pain. Reclining at 135 degrees is also great for work, as it reduces stress on your back.Reclining 135 degrees is halfway between 90 degrees (sitting straight up) and 180 degrees (lying flat). >

, If the floor is carpeted, this can already be a cushy solution, especially if the couch isn't comfortable and there are no recliners. If not, try layering blankets to make the floor as comfy as possible. If you know beforehand that you'll be sleeping on the floor, bring your sleeping bag. Also, if the couch isn't quite comfortable because of armrests, you can try taking the cushions off the couch to make a makeshift bed., Just because you’re sleeping in a recliner or on the couch doesn’t mean you can’t have your favorite pillow or blanket to keep you comfortable. Depending on the recliner you may need additional cushion for neck and back support. If you plan to sleep in the recliner all night, having a blanket can make it feel more restful.

 A safe recommendation is 1g/lb of body weight.


For example, if you are 200lbs, that correlates to 200g of protein/day. Since protein is 4 calories/g, this means that 800 (200 x 4) of the required calories for the day need to come from protein.;
, This can be anywhere from 0.35 to 0.5g per pound of body weight.


For women, the recommended amount is towards the higher end of the range. Since fats are 9 calories/g, determine how many calories need to come from fat using the same method as step 1.
For example, for a 200lb male, the number of grams of fat could be anywhere from 70-100g, or 630 to 900 calories from fat.



Using the previous example of a 200lbs male, this would equal 1430-1700 calories from fats and protein, which when subtracted from the required daily calories would yield the calories available from carbohydrates.
 This is done by dividing the available calories from carbohydrates by 4 since 1g of carbohydrate is 4 calories.

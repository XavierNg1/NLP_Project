 The fact that you haven't had the decorations out as long as the Smiths next door and the Jones over the road just doesn't matter. The intent is to do it now, for Christmas, even if it's Christmas morning. Forgive yourself the hard year or season that you've had and use this last-minute decorating as a cathartic release of tension and a precursor to making a new start for everything from hereon in.
 Here is a list to run through quickly to see what will work in the time you have left:



Fresh tree: You might be able to find a tree at the last minute. Only get one if doing so will not cause major disruptions. They'll often be bargain priced by this time as the sellers realize their last sales rather than losses.

Artificial tree: If getting a fresh tree is too hard, think about hopping into a store that is still open late and grabbing an artificial one for what will likely be a reduced price.

Already have tree: If you already own an artificial tree, use that instead. Get it out!

Tree substitute: If you don't have one and you can't get one, what about substituting the umbrella tree that usually sits in the corner unobtrusively doing nothing? Nothing says you can't use a tropical plant instead of a fir tree! Or find a beautiful branch with twigs and decorate it Ã  la Swedish tradition - red and white is ideal for this.
 Go for bold rather than for quantity. Prefer tinsel, bead chains, paper chains and some large baubles over a lot of finicky stuff that will take ages to unwrap and put up. Little and lots creates stress; big and few makes it simple.
 Put a string across the room and hang or pin them to the string. Instant Christmas decoration!

, If you have one, pin it up. Let the neighbors know that you're home for Christmas after all and you're celebrating it too.
 Decorating and cooking the meal go much more smoothly if you play the music and start the Christmas atmosphere.

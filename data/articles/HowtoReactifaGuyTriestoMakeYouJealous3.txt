 Don't respond when he talks to you via email, texting, or social media. If he tries making you jealous in person, reply in as neutral a manner as possible before ending the conversation and walking away.


In addition to not replying to him directly, you also need to resist the temptation to post that vague, passive-aggressive status update on Facebook or Twitter, and avoid complaining to mutual friends who might let him know.
Stay persistent. It's possible that he may put more effort into making you jealous initially, but if you're consistent, he should eventually get the message that it won't work.
 If he's especially stubborn and the behavior is really getting to you, respond by cutting him off. Unfriend, unfollow, and block him via social media. If things get really bad, block his phone number from your phone and mark his email address as spam.He might temporarily feel pleased upon realizing that he succeeded in making you upset, but now that he's unable to continue the behavior, he'll have no choice but to stop it.
 You might feel tempted to fight fire with fire--or, in this case, fight jealousy with jealousy--but this usually isn't a good idea. Getting into a new relationship just to make your ex jealous won't be fair to you or the new guy you start dating.


Furthermore, flaunting around a new boyfriend you genuinely like can damage the new relationship, too. Using your boyfriend to get back at your ex keeps your focus on the old relationship--and adding fuel to the fires of jealousy will mean keeping the war between you and your ex alive indefinitely. You'll be much better off cutting ties with your ex and focusing on your attentions solely on your new sweetheart.
 Even if the opportunity to get back together with your ex comes up, and even if you're tempted to take it, don't. An ex who goes out of his way to make you jealous is clearly capable of hurting you. This is not the sort of guy who's worthy of your love and affection.

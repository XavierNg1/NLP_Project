 The most economical option is to buy a standard spiral-bound ruled notebook. These notebooks are very inexpensive, and you can organize your tastings chronologically by simply recording each wine on the next free page.;
, Another option is to purchase a ringed binder with a set of dividers. This will allow you to group wines by style or region; for example, you could have separate tabs for reds, whites, and ros√©.
 These are more expensive than blank notebooks, but include pre-printed spaces for recording information about each wine. A popular and widely available wine journal is available from Moleskin in their "Passions" series of notebooks.

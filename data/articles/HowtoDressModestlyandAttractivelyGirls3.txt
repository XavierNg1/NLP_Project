 Fitted pieces do not mean “skin tight,” but they will brush against the natural contours of your body. You do not have to completely hide your curves to still be modest, though. Fitted pieces that lightly conform to your curves will actually make you look clean-cut and well-put-together.
 A-line skirts and pencil skirts are both timeless styles that look nice on most body types. Hemlines that fall at the knee, or thereabouts, are also the most universally flattering.
 Go for classics like boot-cuts or straight-legged pants. These tend to pull away just enough to allow your leg room to breathe, yet they still look flattering on most figures.
 If high necklines are your thing, try mixing in a few mandarin collars with your turtlenecks and crew necks, or look for a V-neck that still sits high on your chest. Do not be afraid of low necklines, since many of these tops can be worn modestly simply by layering a camisole or tank top beneath them.
 You have more options available than the simple t-shirt style short or long sleeve. Look for a few short-sleeve tops with cap or puff sleeves, or long-sleeve tops with kimono, lantern, or bell sleeves. Choosing a fashion-forward sleeve is a good way to stay modest while looking trendy.
 If your dress or skirt obeys most rules of modesty, but you still feel uncomfortable, cover your legs with nylon pantyhose. Plain nude or color styles work best, but you should avoid fishnets or nylons with patterns.
 If you have a knee-length skirt or maxi skirt, consider wearing heels to make your legs look a little longer. Longer legs look attractive, but they do not necessarily look immodest. The right heel will help you look confident and beautiful without looking sultry.

, Online dating allows you to write down exactly what you want. However, don’t get too carried away and write 10 pages of what you’re looking for. Not only will your ad be really specific in what is and is not acceptable, but you will sound horrifically shallow.
 Sometimes guys can send you pictures that have been taken years before, or they’ll send you one of the thousand where they look “normal.” Many guys with advanced computer skills embellish their images, making double chins vanish and muscles more defined. Even worse is a picture that isn’t even them to begin with.
 If the person you're thinking about has nothing to show but his rock hard abs, there is something wrong with him. If you see nothing but their rock hard abs, there is something wrong with you. If you agree to meet them without any knowledge of who they are, you’re only setting yourself up for disappointment.
 If you do, don’t run away or make some horrid excuse to leave. Be nice, stay and chat.
 If your date doesn't, you have every reason to leave because the more he begins to rant on about his inadequacies, the more you will begin to hate yourself for staying.
 It’s not just just an accessory to match your outfit, but it’s your get out of jail free card. When problems arise, you can use your watch to your advantage. Rather than being rude and checking your cell phone, you can casually check the time on your watch, and politely tell them when it's "time to go." Steve will be just another person you can file into your Rolodex of bad dating experiences, while your watch will continue to be by your side. Your watch: Your wingman. Your fashion statement. Your timepiece. So when you leave the house, don’t forget it.

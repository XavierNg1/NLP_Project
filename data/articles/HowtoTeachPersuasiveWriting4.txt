 As your students work on their persuasive essays in class, walk among them, reading what they have so far and offering suggestions. This will help your students stay on track as they write, and prevents them from getting to the end of the writing process before they realize they might be doing something wrong., As your students are writing, have them swap their work with classmates for peer editing. Requiring your students to read one another's writing will give them a chance to view persuasive writing objectively. It also requires them to determine what is effective and what is not. They can apply what they learn from reading their classmates' work to their own writing., Once your students have finished drafting their essays, let them turn them in to you for review. Allowing your students to submit their essays to you once before they “officially” submit them gives them a chance to get written feedback from you and incorporate that feedback before their essays are graded., Once your students have formally submitted their assignments, schedule some time for them to meet in small groups with their classmates to discuss their assignment. They can tell their classmates what they wrote about, what they found difficult and easy about the assignment, and how they might improve next time.

, Hold the cloth with your finger on top of the bottleâ€™s opening. In a quick motion, turn the bottle upside down then right side up again to dampen the cloth. Then gently rub the cloth over the stain in a circular motion. Once the stain begins to transfer to the cloth, use a different area of the cloth to finish cleaning the stain.Alternatively, you can use nail polish remover if the rubbing alcohol does not work. Just remember to wipe the area clean with water before applying the nail polish remover onto the stain., Use a wet towel to remove the rubbing alcohol from the wall once the stain is gone. Then use a clean, dry towel to dry the area.

 Your clothing should be flexible enough that you can move freely and without worrying that your clothes might rip. Types of clothing that you might wear to do the splits include athletic shorts, tennis skirts, or loose tank tops. Materials such as spandex or lycra, frequently used in dancewear, are also good choices.
 Warming up will help you get in the right mindset for doing the splits and may reduce your risk of injury.Warming up involves joint rotations and raising your heart rate, which you can do with light aerobic exercise:First, make slow clockwise and counterclockwise movements with your joints: your toes, ankles, knees, legs, hips, waist, neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, and fingers. You can start from your toes and work your way up or work your way down from your fingers. This will lubricate the entire joint and allow it to move more easily.
After joint rotations, get your blood flowing by jogging or jumping rope for five to 10 minutes.
 Stretching is a way to improve your flexibility. To do the splits, you must include a variety of stretches in your routine that will allow you to develop a full range of motion. These could range from doing lunges to reaching towards your toes.Hold each stretch for 10 â€“ 30 seconds. This is enough time to allow your muscles to lengthen but not too long that it could result in injury if the stretch is done properly.Stop stretching if it hurts. Stretching should never hurt, so if it does, relax the stretch until you feel comfortable again.

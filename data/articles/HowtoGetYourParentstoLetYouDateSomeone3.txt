 Before you introduce your potential significant other to your parents, you should ask yourself if this person is good enough. If you’re scared they might embarrass you, maybe you should re-think dating this person in the first place.


If your parents don’t want you to date and your date leaves a negative impression, it may hurt your chances in the future.
Think about how this person acts around older people and teachers and you can assume the behavior may be similar.
 A good way to introduce the person you want to date to your parents is by introducing them first as a friend. This will make it so that your parents don’t have immediate bias for the person.


If you get in trouble with your “friend” then your parents may get a negative impression and restrict you from dating them.
Let your parents know they are coming beforehand to avoid an awkward situation.
 One way to alleviate the stress that your parents may have with dating is by introducing them to your date’s parents. If they speak to one another they may develop a friendship and a positive impression of the person you’re trying to date.


Some parents look for a strong family behind anyone you’re dating. If this is the case, this approach may win them over.
You can do this at a public sporting event or at a show.
 If you really want to date someone but your parents won’t let you, you should let that person know. That way they won’t take anything personally, but also so that they know to be on their best behavior when they meet them.


You can say "I really like you and want to date you, but I can't constantly fight with my parents so please act respectful and try to make a good impression when you meet them."
If you understand their perspective, you can relay that onto your date and hopefully they will act appropriate and likable.

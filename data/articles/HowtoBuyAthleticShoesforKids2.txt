 Look for a shoe store that offers a variety of reputable shoe brands. You should also consider heading to a specialized shoe store if your child needs a particular kind of athletic shoe, or if your child has flat feet.


Look for reputable shoe brands. Buy from well known brands. Make sure that the shoe is sturdy enough to withstand rough usage.
 While you have measured your child’s foot, it is also important to have this measurement confirmed by a salesperson who specializes in shoes.


Depending on your child’s shoe size and needs, the salesperson may also be able to direct you to a specific style or brand of shoe.
 Once your child has put the shoe on, there are several ways that you can make sure your child’s toes have enough room. First of all, your child’s toes should not be squished inside the shoes; he should be able to move them freely. Other include:


There should be ample space that is as thick as your index finger between the biggest toe and the end of the shoe.
Take a look at the heel. It should be stable and sturdy. It should not be able to move in and out of the heel counter.
While your child is wearing the shoe, make sure that your child’s foot does not slide back and forth inside.
 Let him walk, jump, and run. If your notice your child’s heel slipping out of the back, or he is not able to move as easily as normal, you should try a different size of shoe.
 While your child might not be able to describe the feeling of the shoes perfectly, listen for words like ‘too tight’, ‘squishing’ or ‘ouch’. These are indicators that the shoes are not a good fit.


Uncomfortable shoes can lead to having bunions, calluses, corns, hammer toes, ingrown toenails, etc.

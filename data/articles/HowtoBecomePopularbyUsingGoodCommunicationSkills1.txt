 When you are in public or at a social event, you want people to feel comfortable initiating a conversation with you. Avoid isolating yourself in the back of the room or staying on a cell phone the whole time. Instead, acknowledge the people around you by saying ‘hello’ or smiling when they notice you. You should also make an effort to keep your arms and legs uncrossed, as crossing them makes you look protective and unapproachable., Simply being polite is not the same as socializing. You need to actively move the conversation forward. Engage others beyond just saying ‘hi’ or introducing yourself. Ask them questions about themselves and answer any questions they have about you.For example, if you meet someone at a social event and exchange introductions, you could follow that introduction with a question like “So, what brings you here tonight?”

, When you are nervous, it is likely that the other person (or people) that you are talking to are just as nervous. You can ease the tension by using some light humor, or even pointing out that it’s uncomfortable. If you do tell a joke, make sure that it is a friendly, non-offensive joke.For example, jokes that single out or make fun of a particular group of people or ideas is likely to offend someone around you.
 The best way to get good at socializing is to practice. Start with close friends and family, and then slowly move outside your comfort zone. The more time you spend socializing with other people, the more confident you will become in your ability to do it well.For example, start by socializing with your friends at school. Then, move to having a conversation with someone in the cafeteria that you don’t know that well. Finally, you could move to having a conversation with a stranger at something like a school basketball game.

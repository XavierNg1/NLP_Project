 In a small non-aluminum saucepan, combine two crushed cloves of garlic in 1/2 qt (1/2 L) of distilled water.


You can use up to three cloves of garlic if the cloves are relatively small.
The garlic helps to remove excess mucus in the liver and intestines. Since garlic has natural antiseptic properties, this type of enema is commonly used to treat intestinal worms, bacteria, parasites, and yeast infections.
 Place the saucepan on the stove. Bring the garlic water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the solution for 15 minutes.
 Remove the saucepan from the stove and allow it to sit out at room temperature until it cools. After it cools, strain out the solid pieces.


The enema solution should cool to a temperature between 98 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit (37 and 40 degrees Celsius).
Strain the solution through a fine-mesh metal sieve. Discard the solid pieces of garlic and retain the liquid for the enema. Only use the liquid portion for the enema.
 Add enough distilled water to the garlic water to create a total of 1 qt (1 L).


The water you add should be fairly warm. The temperature of the enema should not drop below 98 degrees Fahrenheit (104 degrees Celsius).
 Administer the enema as usual and retain it for up to 20 minutes.


Try to retain the enema for at least 10 minutes before evacuation. Retaining it for a longer period of time will increase its effectiveness, but do not exceed 20 minutes.

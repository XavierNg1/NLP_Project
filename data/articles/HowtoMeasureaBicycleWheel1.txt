 When the bicycle is upright, you will be able to measure the bike wheel without the bike tipping onto you. If you are measuring the bike alone, a retractable metal tape measure will be sturdier than a plastic tape measure while leaving you a free hand.;
, This measurement is the wheel's radius, or half of its diameter. Multiply the length by two in order to calculate the tire's diameter. With the exception of BMX models, most adult bicycle wheels are between 26 and 29 inches in diameter., The distance is the tire's width. It can vary greatly depending on the tire's intended use. Generally, the wider the tread, the rougher the intended terrain, while narrower treads promise a smoother, faster ride.
 For example, a tire sized 26 x 1.75 would have a 26-inch diameter and a 1.75-inch width across the tread.

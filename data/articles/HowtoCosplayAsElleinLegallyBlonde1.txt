 Dye your hair warm blonde or sport a wig. The higher quality of your dye or wig, the more convincing your cosplay as Elle will be. Curl the ends of your hair softly to achieve that feminine sweetness. Change your hairstyle frequently.;
, Even if you're going to the grocery store, deck yourself out. You can layer on some accessories such as celebrity-inspired sunglasses or diva-esque jewelry. This is the chance for you to strut your stuff.


If you wear another color, make sure it matches with the pink in your outfit. You can wear a fabulous pink pantsuit or a tailored pink blazer to look professional yet chic.
 Dress the dog in pink to match your outfit!


You may be tempted to set your dog on a vegetarian diet, as Elle does, but under no circumstances should you do this. The verdict is still out on whether dogs are omnivores or carnivores, and there haven't been enough conclusive studies on whether or not a vegetarian diet is good for dogs. It's best to just feed your dog normal dog food and avoid the possible consequences of deviating from a vet-approved diet.
 Keep in mind that Elle is a vegetarian. She's also very physically fit, so it's a good idea to exercise regularly. Sign up for gym membership if you haven't.
 Never let anyone catch you unpolished when you're Elle. Make sure your make-up is enhancing you and your outfit. Do not overdo it. Look classy and fresh with natural eyeliner, a bit of eyeshadow, and some lipgloss or lipstick. You want to look groomed, not like you're a member of the cabaret.

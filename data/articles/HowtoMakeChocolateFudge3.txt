 This will keep the fudge from thickening too fast., Mix the ingredients well using a whisk or a handheld or an electric mixer. Continue mixing the ingredients together until the coconut cream has melted.


If you have trouble finding coconut butter at the store, you can make it yourself. All you need to make it are 2 cups of shredded coconut and a food processor. Just place it in the food processor for 15-20 minutes and you're good to go., Continue stirring the ingredients together until they are fully combined. Raw honey works best.
 You can prepare the pan while you're heating the ingredients or even before you've started cooking. Just line an 8 inch (20 centimeter) pan with foil and spray it with non-stick spray.
 Make sure to pour it in evenly so the fudge is well distributed.
 Give the dairy-free fudge at least 4 hours to set and then you're good to go.
 Remove the fudge from the fridge, cut it into 1 or 2 inch (2.5 or 5 centimeter) squares, and it's ready to eat.

 Wearing jeans that are the same wash as your denim shirt can make your attire look monotonous, bland, and overly casual. Mix things up by wearing different washes. The stronger the contrast, the better. A light blue or white washed denim shirt can look trendy when paired with dark wash skinny jean or boot-cut jean.;
, When you wear a denim shirt with jeans is to wear something beneath your denim shirt. Moreover, denim is considered a neutral in the fashion world, so you can mix and match a variety of colors with it. Try wearing a pink camisole tank top or a black fitted t-shirt with embellishments beneath an open-button denim shirt. For an edgier look, wear a sparkly metallic top beneath a light or medium-wash denim shirt and above dark wash jeans.
 While denim matched with denim will create a fairly casual look, you can dress it up for a day out with friends by wearing the right sort of accessories. Simple metal jewelry, like gold or silver hoop earrings or bangle bracelets, can give your style a chic upgrade. Funky, chunky gems, on the other hand, can give off a more carefree appearance.
 Since denim on denim tends to be along the more casual side, ultra feminine strappy heels may not make the best choice. Instead, opt for a good fashion boot. A brown fashion boot plays into the casual nature of denim while a black boot adds a subtle hint of class.

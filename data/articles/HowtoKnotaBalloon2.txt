 This works well to knot balloons that you've inflated with a helium tank.

Keep the neck closed tightly by pressing the index finger and thumb of your dominant hand against each other around the neck.



Center the neck of the balloon at a right angle beneath the "Knot Me" tool, and stretch it at the same time.



Hold the body of the balloon in your non-dominant hand and move it up, over, and down to the other side of the "Knot Me" tool. The neck of the balloon should now form a loop.



Bring your dominant hand, which is holding the neck of the balloon, up and towards your body. Slip the neck through the slot and release it.



Pull the balloon off the tool. The neck will form a tight knot.

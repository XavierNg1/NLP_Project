 Bullies push people around because they think they have the power to do so. They don't. Find people who are supposed to be in charge to help. It is their responsibility to stop bullying, and they should use it.;
, Bullying has become such a serious issue of discussion in recent years that it has become hard to ignore. In the past, adults often dismissed it by suggested that young people always must solve the problem on their own or simply told victims of bullying to ignore the bullies. Increased sensitivity to the issue has made those statements seem out of place. Both the National Institute of Health (a federal agency) and the American Academy of Pediatrics have websites devoted to anti-bullying initiatives, and these are just some indications of the growing awareness of bullying's significance.Some adults may not have gotten the message, but increasing numbers understand that bullying simply cannot be tolerated any longer.
 It is unfortunate that some adults won't listen, but if those in the area won't listen to you then they should at least listen to your parents. School officials and others who work with young people sometimes do not adequately respect the young people they supervise, but they usually cannot reject the input of parents--the ones who give them authority by placing young people in their care. If they still refuse to deal with the situation, then at least your parents can begin thinking of ways to get you out of that environment. But they can't begin this process unless you talk to them.

 If you want to change an individual character (or string of characters) without changing all of the text, you can do so by selecting the character(s) with the text tool., The selected character(s) should now have an outline surrounding them.
 The palette is represented by a box that’s the same color as the currently-selected text. A larger palette will appear, containing a variety of colors from which to choose.


To change the Stroke (the outline surrounding the text rather than the text itself), double-click the bottom of the two boxes. It will either have a red line over it (if there is not currently a Stroke color) or will be displayed as a box with a thick outline around it.



If you’re dissatisfied with the color, press ⌘ Cmd+Z (Mac) or Ctrl+Z (Windows) to undo the changes.
You can also change the font face and size of individual characters using this method.

 Wobbler's disease is a painful ailment found in many large dog breeds, such as Dobermans, Great Danes, and mastiffs, and is caused by either a slipped or herniated disc, or by a bony deformity around the spinal cord.The name Wobbler comes from the short, "wobbly" stride of dogs afflicted with this disease.Typical symptoms of Wobbler's syndrome include:


Weakness in the limbsDifficulty standing or rising after recliningTendency to drag one or more paws (usually the back legs; look for worn or chipped nails as telltale signs)Muscle loss extending through the shouldersPartial or full paralysis of one or more limbs, Your veterinarian will most likely order X-rays, a CT scan, or an MRI in order to diagnose whether or not your dog has Wobbler's syndrome. Depending on the severity of your dog's condition, your vet may recommend surgery., Unless your vet orders surgery to correct the problem, the best thing you can do is make your dog comfortable. Administer any medications your vet prescribes to treat inflammation and swelling in the neck and spine. You will also need to reduce your dog's activity. Some vets recommend keeping dogs with Wobbler's syndrome confined to a crate in order to let the dog rest and restrict his movement.If your vet diagnoses your dog with Wobbler's syndrome, you will need to use a harness for walking him instead of a leash. Do not keep a collar on your dog's neck if he is diagnosed with Wobbler's disease., Some veterinary clinics offer water therapy and acupuncture as part of a holistic rehabilitation therapy. Talk to your vet about what may work best for your dog.

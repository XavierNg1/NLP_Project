 It's true that dating an intersex person can have specific challenges. But in most ways, it's not really that different from any relationship. Remember, an intersex person is just that--a person.Treat your partner like an individual. Don't think, "I'm dating an intersex person." Instead, think, "I'm dating Robin."
Get to know the unique personality characteristics of your partner. Find out what makes them laugh, what foods they like, and what they like to read.
Look for common interests. Finding things in common can help you bond at any point in your relationship.
 Dating should be enjoyable. Whether you are getting ready for your second date or your fiftieth, make sure that you are having fun. Put some effort into finding enjoyable activities that you can share together.Go on an adventure. Try hiking a new trail or exploring a new city during a weekend road trip.
Take turns planning date nights. Even if it's just a movie on the couch, it can feel fun and romantic when the other person plans an evening all about the two of you.
Laugh together. Watch a funny movie or go to a dog park and watch the puppies play.
 Dating can be hard. It can be especially complicated if it is the first time you are dating an intersex person. Try to take some of the pressure off of yourself.Know that there might be bumps in the road. Don't be upset if your relationship is not perfect--no one's is.
Don't worry so much about the future. You don't need to determine immediately (or even in the first year) whether the person you are dating is "the one".
Remind yourself that it takes time to get to know someone. Relax and take time to figure each other out.
Be kind to yourself. Be patient as you explore a new relationship. It's okay to learn as you go.

 Fold it in half vertically with the front of the shirt facing outward, making sure that the sleeves are evenly aligned. Use a pen to mark the point on the collar where the shirt is folded.
 Holding a tape measure at the base of your neck, measure from that point to a couple of inches below your shoulder on the opposite side.


Round down by 1 or 2 centimeters, and then divide that number in half.
 Measure from the shoulder of your shirt (about 2 inches away from the collar) to the front center of the shirt. Mark the point where your measurement (divided by two) aligns with the original marking you made in the center of the collar. Mark just above the tape measure at that point and at the starting point (0).
 Making sure you are only cutting the top layer, make a circular cut from the shoulder to the center of the shirt where you made your mark. Now, make a horizontal cut at the starting point to release the collar and create a flap.
 Use it as a template to continue cutting the other side of the T-shirt. Again, make sure you are only cutting the top layer of the T-shirt.
 For the back of the shirt, only cut along the hem of the collar. Making a scooped cut in the back of the shirt will make the hole too large and the shirt will hang too low off of your shoulder.
 Cut the hems off of each sleeve and the bottom of the T-shirt.
, Enjoy your new off shoulder T!

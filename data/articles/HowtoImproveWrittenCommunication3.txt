 One of the most common grammar mistakes is the improper use of an apostrophe. Remember that an apostrophe shows ownership or possession. For example, if you are talking about the television your husband owns, you should not write “my husbands television.” You should write “my husband’s television.”If a noun does not end in s, add ‘s to the end of the noun. For example, if you are talking about the paws of a dog, write, “the dog’s paws.”
If the noun is plural and already ends in s, just add an apostrophe. For example, if you are talking about the paws of two dogs, write, “the dogs’ paws.”

, Proper nouns and the words formed from them should always be capitalized. You should always capitalize names, countries, cities, states, nationalities, languages, educational institutions, educational degrees, government departments, political parties, and trade or brand names. You should also capitalize the first word of a sentence as well as the first word of a quote., A common grammar mistake is the use of incomplete sentences, also known as sentence fragments. Each sentence that is punctuated should be a complete thought and be able to stand on its own as a sentence.

 Number the figures and tables separately, with each set using consecutive numbers:


“Table 1, Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Figure 5.”

, Don’t make the design overly complicated. Use a sans-serif font. Fonts should be 8 to 14 point.
 Place the figure or table number in italics, and then write a title and caption. Both will be in sentence case, meaning only the first word is capitalized. The caption should be a short description of what is in the figure.


Use a legend to explain any symbols.
 Create figures that are 2 to 3.25 inches (5.1 to 8.3 cm) in width for one column; for two columns, they can be 4.25 to 6.875 inches (10.8 to 17.5 cm).

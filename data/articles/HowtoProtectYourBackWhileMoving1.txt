 Take a look at what needs to be moved and if necessary, ask others to help you.
 Do not assume you can lift or move something heavy on your own.
 This will give you an idea of how to manage the lifting.
 This will tuck your pelvis and keep your back balanced.



Stand close to whatever you are lifting.
Keep your feet about shoulder width apart.
 Squatting will keep your back properly aligned and use larger muscles in your legs to support your body and the weight of the object you are carrying.
 Slowly straighten your knees and back while you stand up.
 Lifting and moving an object in unison will prevent injury and keep one of you from dropping your end.


Assign one person the responsibility of saying "lift" so there is no confusion.
 Do not twist while you lift. This is dangerous for your back.

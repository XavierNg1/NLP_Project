 You will need your subfloor to be ready for laying down hardwood floors. This tutorial focuses on installing solid hardwoods, so you will want a wood subfloor if you want to follow the directions exactly. Other options are available, however.


Donâ€™t forget to consider things like door jambs as well. You will need to be able to either get your floors underneath the molding or you will need to cut your floor to go around it.
 Before you install solid hardwood floors, you will need to let the wood acclimate to the moisture level of your home first. Leave the wood to sit in the room in which it will be installed for at least three days. Try to install the floor during either the Spring or Fall, when the temperature is neither very hot nor very cold. Temperature will also affect the wood.
 A larger number of tools and supplies will be necessary to complete this project. You can rent larger pieces, like flooring nailers, from your local hardware store. Other pieces, like nails, will need to be purchased. You can find the materials list for this project at the bottom of this page.

 You can find a reputable company online, in your local phone book or by asking friends and neighbors for referrals.
 He will propose a removal method that might include poisoning the rats or setting traps for them. Make sure you explain the extent of your rat problem so that you get an accurate quote.
 Some of them can be harmful to pets and people living in your home, particularly small children. If a child or a pet comes across rat poison and it it they will be seriously ill and may die.
 They can cause terrible odors in your home if they are left in walls or attics. Most exterminators will do this for no extra charge but if you are uncomfortable with seeing the dead bodies of rats then it is best to ask and make sure. Hopefully the exterminator will handle the whole process from start to finish.
 Choose the one you are comfortable with. Price quotes can vary wildly between companies so try to find a good deal and an exterminator that you feel comfortable with. This will make the process much easier.
 You do not want to have to call an exterminator again in a month or two if the rats return, or if turns out not all of the rats were removed from your property. Try to choose a company that offers a satisfaction guarantee so that you can get your money back if the rats are not fully taken care of. At the very least, the exterminator should come back and finish the job for no extra charge.

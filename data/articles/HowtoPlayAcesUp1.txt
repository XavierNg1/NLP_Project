 One of the best things about Aces Up is that you can play it on a very small surface. If you're at home, any table or flat surface will do. While on the go, play the game on the back of a book, an in-flight tray, or even the top of your laptop.;
, While some solitaire games use more than one deck of cards, Aces Up only requires one standard 52 card deck. Buy a deck at the store or use one you've got around the house. Just make sure it has all 52 cards, or you won't be able to win. It's also possible to play online if you have a computer and access to the internet., There are two main parts in the setup of Aces High: the tableau and the stock. Deal the tableau by placing four cards, face up, in a row. The remaining cards become the stock. Set it off the the side, facedown.

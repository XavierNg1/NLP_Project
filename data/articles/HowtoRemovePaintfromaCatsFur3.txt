 If your cat only has a few, targeted spots on their fur, trimming is the easiest way to remove it. Let the paint harden first. Using a pair of nail scissors, gently cut the paint patches away. Try to remove as much of the paint from the cat’s fur as possible.If you manage to trim off all of the paint, you do not need to do anything else.
Be careful not to cut too close to the cat’s skin. If you are having difficulty trimming the fur or if your cat is wiggling, you may want to skip to using oils to remove the paint.
 If the paint is deep into the cat’s fur or if it covers a larger spot, you can use vegetable or mineral oils to get it out. Pour a little into your hand, and work it into the paint spots.Use a paper towel to pat out excess oil.It may take a few tries to get all of the paint out. Keep rubbing in oil and gently patting it away until all of the paint is removed.
Do not use turpentine or harsh paint removers. These can burn and irritate a cat's skin.
 The oil will loosen and help you remove most of the paint by hand. That said, you should bathe your cat after this process to make sure that all of the oil and paint is gone.Run a lukewarm bath, and wash the cat with a cat shampoo. Towel dry afterwards.

 Use a thermometer to diagnose whether someone has a fever. For adults, any body temperature above 100.4ºF (38ºC) is considered a fever.


The normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Your particular body temperature might be a bit higher or lower than this. Use an abnormal temperature and related symptoms to determine if you have a fever.
Other symptoms of fever include sweating, shivering, headaches, and dehydration.
Temperatures between 103 and 106 degrees Fahrenheit might result in confusion, irritability, or hallucinations.
 Swollen glands and a sore throat could indicate you’ve contracted CMV.If your throat hurts constantly, feels scratchy or raspy, or your neck feels swollen, monitor your condition.


Use an over-the-counter throat medicine to relieve swelling and pain in your throat.
 Individuals with CMV often suffer from extreme fatigue.You may feel listless and constantly tired. Get at least eight hours of sleep each night in order to reduce feelings of fatigue.
 Since the symptoms of CMV could be due to many illnesses, it is important to confirm or rule out the existence of CMV with a blood test.If symptoms consistent with CMV persist, talk to your doctor about your condition. He or she may recommend that you get a test to look for CMV and prescribe a treatment plan.


Individuals with compromised immune systems might exhibit additional symptoms, including diarrhea, hepatitis, shortness of breath, and pneumonia.
Infants with congenital CMV might also exhibit unique symptoms, such as jaundice, seizures, a rash of purple spots across the skin, and a low birth weight.A laboratory test can detect the virus in a person's body fluids (blood or urine) or by a tissue biopsy.

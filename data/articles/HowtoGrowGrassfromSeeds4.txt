 As your grass becomes established, it will need less and less water (allowing for weather). It's typically best to continue watering lightly every other day for a week or two after the grass blades appear. You can then gradually reduce the watering schedule until you are watering only once a week.You can also increase the amount of water per session at the same time, until you are providing enough water to make the soil soaked, but not soggy.


If the grass starts turning brown or looking dry, quickly water to revive it.
Don't water your lawn after heavy rain or it could become waterlogged.
 Mowing grass encourages it to grow thick and healthy. If it grows too tall, it will get reedy and tough. Mow when the grass is 4 inches (10.2Â cm) tall.Grass clippings in the yard act as a natural mulch to aid stronger grass.
Consider a push reel mower instead of a power mower. Push reel mowers are better for the health of your grass because they snip it neatly unlike power mowers which tear and shred it, making it more susceptible to disease. Plus, push reel mowers do not emit pollution.
 After six weeks, when the grass is healthy and tall, give it another application of fertilizer specifically made for grass. This ensures healthy growth for the rest of the season. Fertilize your lawn at the beginning of each growing season.

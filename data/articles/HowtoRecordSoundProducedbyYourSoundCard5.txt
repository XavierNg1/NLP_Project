 If recording to the internal sound card is not possible for whatever reason, there is still a way to capture your computer’s audio by using an external device plugged into your computer’s output.
 Connect a stereo sound cable (usually a stereo mini-plug) into the output port of your computer’s sound card (the green port), and the input of an external device. These include:


An MP3 recorder.
Smart phones like the iPhone or Android.
A professional recording system.
You can even use a second computer.



As with the Hardware Method outlined above, all sounds from your computer will be recorded, including system sounds like beeps, alarms, and alerts. You may wish to disable these before recording.

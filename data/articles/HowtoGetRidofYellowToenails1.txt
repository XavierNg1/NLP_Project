 Fungus thrives in humid environments with a high pH, making a sweaty sock the perfect place to start a colony. Fungal infections usually come with other symptoms as well, such as thicker or brittle nails, as well as crumbling and flaking. Less common, but alternate reasons for yellow toenails include:


Frequent use of nail polishes, which leave some dye on your toenails.
Diabetes.
Yellow Toenail Syndrome, which is genetic.
Lymphedema (chronic leg swelling).;
, If you nail is not brittle or chipping, you may be able to fight the infection with an over-the-counter cream. Two of the most popular are Mycocide NS and Nonyx Nail Gel, which require you to apply the product twice a day for several weeks.
 While there are some over-the-counter anti-fungal creams, you will usually need to see a professional to get a cream strong enough to fight the fungus under your toenail. Common drugs include:


Cicloprox (generic name), Zetaclear, Sporanox, and Lamisil., You need to kill the entire colony to get rid of the infection or it will simply come back. Keep up treatment until you are sure the infection is gone, and be patient. It may take several months.


If your toenails are still yellow or flaky after several weeks, make another appointment with a podiatrist.
 This should be used as a last resort, as it can take up to a year for a new nail to grow back. However, if you cannot comfortably live your life it may be best to remove the nail and move on.

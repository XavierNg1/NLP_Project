 Making your own soothing throat spray is very simple — you don’t need to spend money at the store. All you need is ¼ cup of filtered water and ½ teaspoon of table salt or sea salt. Make sure the water is warm when you mix them together to encourage the salt to dissolve evenly.
 A simple salt-water solution can be very soothing, but essential oils can speed up the healing process. Simply mix the essential oils well with the salt-water mixture. Two drops of any of the following essential oils can both relieve pain and fight the infection causing the sore throat:


Menthol essential oil (pain reliever) Eucalyptus essential oil (antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory) Sage essential oil (antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory), A one or two ounce glass bottle with a spray attachment is ideal. This size will be small enough for you to carry around with you throughout the day. You can have it both at home and on the go.
 When your throat feels particularly sore, pull out your spray bottle and give yourself a spritz. Open your mouth wide and aim the spray attachment toward the very back of your throat. Spray once or twice to soothe your irritation.

 For women’s styles, the cuff works best with looser fit jeans. This could mean “boyfriend” jeans, or just roomier, straight-legged jeans.


For men’s styles, the rolled cuff is a simple cuff, and one of the most adaptable looks. A simple rolled cuff works on nearly all types and weights of denim.
 There is a bit of freedom with this cuff, but fold both bottom legs of your jeans about 1 inch. Make sure that the fold is even all the way around the circumference of the jean leg.


For men’s styles, aim for a 2-inch initial fold.
 For women’s styles, fold the bottom of your jeans again on both legs to make a doubled 1-inch cuff. This fold doesn’t have to be perfect, so don’t worry about smoothing out the cuff.


Consider lightly tugging and plucking at the cuff to give it a rounder, fatter look.
For men’s styles, make your second fold by folding in the hem of your jeans into your initial fold. This fold should completely hide your jeans’ hemline on the inside of the first cuff.

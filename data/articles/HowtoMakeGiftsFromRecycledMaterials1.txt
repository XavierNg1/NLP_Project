 If you want to make this craft soon, you can inquire at a local restaurant or wine bar to see if they will save wine corks that they usually throw away.

Keep in mind a 16 by 20 inch (40.6 by 50.8 cm) board requires approximately 100 corks, if they are evenly cut in half.;
, This will serve as the backing to your cork board. Choose something that already has a frame around the edges, or make a frame out of reclaimed wood or metal.

Think about preferences of the person you are planning to give the gift to. A cork board is a great gift for wine lovers and it can be used in the kitchen, hallway or office. Choose a frame that reflects the interior d√©cor preferences of this person.
 Allow it to dry., This is not necessary to create a cork board; however, the board will be sturdier and more durable if you glue on a flat surface. This part of the project may take a few hours, depending upon the size of your cork board., Gather all your corks nearby., Place it vertically in the top corner of your frame, making sure there isn't a space between the frame and the cork. Glue and place another cork next to it vertically., The width of these corks should equal the length of the vertical corks. Continue this pattern, gluing corks in groups of 2 horizontally and vertically across the board.

You may need to cut your corks into smaller sizes near the end of the board to ensure there is no empty space between the corks and the frame. Allow the glue to dry completely according to package instructions.
 Wrap it and give it away as a present.

For a twist on this project, use a smaller frame to make a trivet or smaller pieces of cardboard or MDF to make a set of coasters.

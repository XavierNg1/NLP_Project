 If your child feels forgotten or ignored, they are likely to be upset. Even though they may not be able to express why they feel this way, they are likely to lash out for attention. Sometimes this lashing out is aggressive in nature., Children are constantly learning how to work with other people. As they learn, they will make mistakes and push the boundaries of what is acceptable. Avoid the urge to consider this a failure or to give up. , When you are discussing behaviors with your child, make a point to be constructive. Praise them for good behavior, and redirect them when they act aggressively. When you give them constructive criticism, point out ways that they could handle a situation more effectively, but avoid telling them that they are bad. That way, they understand that their behavior might not be acceptable, but you still love them.For example, you can say something like, “I know you are upset, but I think you could have handled the situation better. Maybe you should try talking to your friend about the toy instead of hitting them.”
Make a point to regularly praise your child for good behavior so that they are more open to you when you have to offer constructive criticism.
 When talking to your child, reach out and make physical contact. A hand on the shoulder or arm will let your child know that you are present with them and will keep their attention on you. This is especially true for young children.

 When you're playing with a new opponent, whether it's at a competition or during a friendly game at a family outing, you should actively try to discover your opponent's weaknesses. Find out whether they play more aggressively or defensively. Look for weaknesses like slow footwork, weak drop shot returns or etc.
 Don't hit all of your shots to the same location of the court; this makes you predictable. Place your shots differently. Aim to confuse and tire your opponent.


If your opponent hits the shuttle straight at you or to the net, hit the shuttle in a different direction instead of hitting it right back at your opponent, where they will expect it to go.
You can use long shots to force your opponent to run around the court. Make sure you return to center after hitting your shots, this makes you better prepared to return shots while your opponent’s position is much less stable.
 A beginner is just happy when he hits the shuttle over the net. An advanced player understands that you should always position your shot wisely so that you move your opponent to the exact place where you want them to be so you can hit the following shot or smash them.


Always return to base after sending or returning a shot. This means returning to the center of the area you’re covering (your half of the court in singles)., If you like staying near the net, serve short and hit drop shots, do whatever you can to make sure that your opponent can't hit the shuttle to the back line. If you're more comfortable at the back line, serve long and hit speedy shots so your opponent doesn't have a chance to move you towards the net.
 If you lack confidence, you may hold yourself back and lose the match. Be especially careful not to let this happen against opponents close to your skill level. However, make sure you don’t get too confident.You might underestimate your opponent's ability and play below the level you should.

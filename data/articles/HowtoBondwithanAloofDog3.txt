 Aloof dogs may take time to warm up to you. This may be due to their upbringing, the fact that they were in a shelter, or their overall temperament. Don’t shower too much attention on the dog. Let the dog know you are there, show them affection, but give them space. Let them come to you. Don’t always go to them.While you are bonding with your aloof dog, it will take time for them to warm to you. As you work on the bond, give them time to miss you and make the decision for themselves to come to you and want to be near you.
 Dogs, like people, have preferences. A way to bond with your dog is to figure out what they like and don’t so you can avoid forcing them to do or eat things they don’t like.For example, your dog may hate having their ears touched, wearing clothes, or being around loud noises. Knowing what to not do around your dog can help demonstrate to them that you care and strengthen their sense that you will protect them.
 You may want to adopt a routine where you feed your dog instead of leaving food out all day. This can help your dog associate you with food, which will help you be an important provider for them.Pick two to three times each day you can consistently give your dog food. Feed your dog at the same time every day.
 To build trust with your aloof dog, you should never use violence. This includes physical violence, like hitting or kicking, and harsh words. Yelling or screaming will not get an aloof dog to bond with you.Don't punish your dog for not wanting to do things they don't want to do, like go for walks, be groomed, or take a bath. Instead, be patient, calm, and use positive reinforcement.

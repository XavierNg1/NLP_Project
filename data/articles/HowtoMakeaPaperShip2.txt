 There are a variety of ways to make your paper ship last longer. Applying strips of tape to the bottom, all around, is a good way to increase the shipâ€™s water resistance.


Make two ships and put one inside the other. This will increase the water resistance as well as the overall sturdiness.
Color the ship with crayons. The wax will help the paper resist water.
Instead of tape, coating the bottom with plastic film wrap will provide a good barrier to the water.
If you plan to re-use it, let the ship dry out after use. Then wrap it in plastic to protect it.
 Using lightweight paper, such as a simple sheet of rectangular computer printer paper, is best. You can use a heavier material such as construction paper, but it will be more difficult to make clean, crisp folds. Remember, this is essentially an origami technique. Origami traditionally uses light but durable paper. Printer, or copy, paper is a happy medium for a relatively simple fold such as a paper ship.
You can also buy origami paper, or kami which is a product developed in Japan in the early twentieth century. It is often decorated and can be found in art supply stores. It is a bit lighter, but is fairly similar in weight to copy paper. You can also use newspaper, but it will be slightly less durable, and easier to tear.
 Widen the bottom by pulling out the diagonal edges. Making the bottom flatter will help the ship stay afloat longer. This will also widen the surface area of the bottom for more stability.
 Using two ships, one inside the other, help the ship have more buoyancy, as well as helping the paper be more resistant to water. Try placing small pebbles around the edge of the triangular middle part of the ship. The pebbles will act as ballast and help the ship keep upright. You can also adjust the weight placement of the pebbles to make the ship move in a straight line.

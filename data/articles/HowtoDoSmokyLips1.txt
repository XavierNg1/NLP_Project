 A smoky lip is a sheer black layered on top of a flat or matte, opaque lipstick. The black layer often has some shimmer as well.Some companies, such as Lipstick Queen, sell kits that include a nude colored lipstick and a sheer, black, shimmery lipstick. You can use such a kit, if you prefer, or you can use lipstick from you own collection.


The opaque lipstick can be any color your want. Red and purple are great choices, but you can also use a pinky nude as well.The black lipstick must be sheer, preferably with some shimmer to it.;
, You can apply it straight from the tube or using a lipstick brush. Keep in mind that the black lipstick will darken this color by several shades.You do not need to blot the lipstick, but you can smack your lips to help "spread" it more evenly. Having a little excess lipstick on you lips is actually a good idea, because it will help the sheer layer blend in better.
 Once again, the black lipstick must be sheer, or the final color will be too dark. It is best to apply this shade straight from the tube. This way, you will have more control over the layering.
 Sheer black lipstick will never come out pure black, which is the point of the smokey lip look. A single layer may be too light for you, however. If you want a darker shade, add another layer or two of sheer, black lipstick.
 Use a lipstick brush to help blend out the color and layering. Take a close look at the outline of you lips, especially the corners. If something looks uneven, use a lipstick brush to fix it.Once you are happy with the look, you are ready to go.

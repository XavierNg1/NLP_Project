 Add 5 ounces (148 ml) of isopropyl alcohol to a clean plastic or glass spray bottle. Make sure that there is enough room at the top of the bottle to mix in the water and oil.For the best results, use 70% isopropyl alcohol in the brush cleaner spray. The alcohol doesn’t just serve as a disinfectant for the brushes; it also helps the cleaner dry more quickly so you can spot clean your brushes and use them right away.
Your spray bottle should hold at least 8 ounces (237 ml).
 With the alcohol in the spray bottle, pour in 2 ounces (59 ml) of distilled water and 10 to 15 drops of your favorite essential oil. Shake the bottle well to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully mixed.The essential oil is meant to cover the alcohol scent of the cleaner, so you can use whichever fragrance you prefer. However, you may want to use an oil with antibacterial properties, such as eucalyptus, peppermint, lavender, or tea tree oil.
Because the oil may separate from the other ingredients, always shake the spray well before using it.
 To use the cleaner, lightly spray the bristles of the brushes. Run the brushes back and forth over a towel or piece of paper towel. Allow the brush to air dry for a minute or two, and then use the brush as you normally would.Feel the brushes’ bristles before using them after cleaning to make sure that the cleaner has dried completely.

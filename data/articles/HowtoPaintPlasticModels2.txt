 Make sure you have the right paintbrushes and paint as well as a cutting mat to prevent any paint getting onto tables or carpets or floors.
 Once the paint pot has been opened, practice painting on a scrap of card to get an idea of how the delivery of the paint is, and how the brush covers an area.


Practice your brush strokes so you apply the right amount of paint, leaving no bare spots or globs of paint.
Practice painting with different brushes (broad flat, fine tip and medium round) so you know what results you get with each brush type.



Read the instruction sheet and carefully paint each part according to the color chart.
Paint small parts while they are still attached onto the sprue, while paint bigger parts after assembly.
Place each section gently onto a paper towel after painting each part.
Allow each section to dry completely.
Paint a second coat on top of the first.
Allow the second coat to dry completely.



Paint areas that were attached to plastic holders if they are to be painted.



Pour the cleaner into a small jar.
Place the dirty paint brushes in, with the bristles completely immersed in the cleaner.
Remove the brushes and clean them with the cleaner and your fingers.
Shape the bristles so they are not distorted and set them into the jar, bristles facing up into the air, so they dry completely.

 Elderly people are often on fixed budgets that allow little room for flexibility. The cost of cigarettes is relatively expensive and continues to rise. Assuming a pack of cigarettes costs $21, and she smokes a pack each day, she’d spend about $77,000 on cigarettes over the course of 10 years. Encourage your grandma to think about that and ask her if she would like to have an extra $77,000 in 10 years.Customize this savings statistic for your grandmother’s situation. For instance, if she smokes one pack every other day, do the math and figure out how much she’d save over the course of one month, one year, and so on.
 Many rental properties – including apartment, flats, and low-income housing for seniors – have no-smoking policies.If your grandma smokes, she will be unable to rent these properties and possibly miss out on meeting great new neighbors and saving money on potentially lower rent.
 Many people are irritated by the smell of smoke, and don’t like being near smokers. Even when your grandma isn’t actively smoking, her clothes and hair may smell of smoke, and make people not want to be near her. Perhaps you and other relatives don’t enjoy visiting your grandma because the home is constantly in a pall of smoke and littered with ashtrays. Going out to restaurants and other public venues can be difficult too, since many places ban smoking.

 Ice is a well known home remedy for many types of swelling or pain.You can also use ice to reduce puffiness around your eyes. Put some ice in a plastic baggie and seal the bag. If you are low on ice, you can also use a bag of frozen vegetables. A bag of frozen peas makes a good substitute for an ice pack.Make sure that you wrap the bag or ice or frozen vegetables with a paper towel or a clean dish towel before you apply it to your eyes. Do not apply ice to your skin without a towel as a barrier or you may damage your skin., If the pack is larger enough, then you can ice both eyelids at once. If not, you will need to alternate. You can sit or stand and hold the ice pack in place, but you may also want to recline or lay down to make the process more relaxing.
 If it starts to feel too cold, remove it and take a break for a few minutes.If you are icing one eye at a time, then you will need to repeat the process for your other eye when you are finished with the first one.

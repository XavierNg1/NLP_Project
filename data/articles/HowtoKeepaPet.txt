 You must always keep in mind that your pet has feelings. Just like you, they want freedom, good food, entertainment and may have acute feelings like sorrow, happiness etc. A pet may not be a human but it's feelings and needs are very similar. They may not be able to express their feelings to us but they feel just like us and they enjoy and suffer, just like you and me.;
,, It is your duty and responsibility to see that they don't feel as if they are different or that they suffer from loneliness or sorrow. You must take and treat them as a family member, loving and caring for them as if it was brother, sister, son or daughter.
 Read and learn about your pet. This way you will be able to understand his or her needs. Try to understand his or her body language. Spending more time with him or her will strengthen your relationship and allow you to understand your pet better. A pet who is comfortable in new surroundings will not be active and may be defensive/aggressive. These pets are ideal for families or the elderly. On the other hand, curious and active personalities are not submissive and are ideal for families without children below 10 years old.
 Unless your pet will be alone for a long period pf time, examples would be for an entire day or a few days at length.
 Allow your pet to enjoy his freedom. Don't disturb his or her sleep and try not to leave them in a closed atmosphere .
 Allow your pet to come in contact that is harmful, try not to disturb as he might have a reason but he is unable to express it.

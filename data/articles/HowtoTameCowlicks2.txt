 It is best to apply hair gel while the hair is still wet. Drop a small amount of gel in the palm of your hand and rub your hands together. Run your fingers through your hair over the area of the cowlick. Massage the gel into the roots of your hair and rub it in all directions for full coverage.


Once the gel is massaged into the roots, press and comb the cowlick in the direction you would like it styled.
Some gel is heat-activated. Use a hair dryer to style your hair the way you would like it after applying the hair gel.
 Apply pomade to dry hair to help style it in the direction you wish the hair to run. Run your forefinger and middle finger through the pomade to pick up some of the wax. Rub these fingers against your thumb to spread the pomade. Grab the area of hair you would like to adjust and pull it from root to end with these two fingers and thumb, covering the area with pomade, and pulling the hair in the direction you would like it styled.


Choose a pomade with a matte finish.
Avoid using more than a thin layer of pomade or your hair may appear wet until you wash the pomade out.
 Root brushes are specifically created for getting to the root and adjusting the direction of hair growth. While your hair is wet, repeatedly run the brush over the cowlick in the opposite direction of the hair growth.The bristles are very flexible to keep from tangling in the hair follicle.
Many root brushes come with a pointed end to assist in parting your hair where you like it.

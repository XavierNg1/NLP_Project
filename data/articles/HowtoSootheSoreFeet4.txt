 Hot-and cold-water therapy can be effective in treating foot pain. The hot treatment will promote blood flow, while the cold treatment will reduce inflammation.


Fill one bucket with cold water and another with bearably hot water. Sit in a comfortable chair, dip your feet in the hot water for three minutes and then do the same with cold water for at least 10 seconds or up to a minute. Repeat the whole process two or three times and end with cold foot bath.
Another option is to apply a heat pad and an ice pack alternately for 10 minutes to reduce pain.
 Vinegar is used in various treatments and can help with foot pain due to sprains or strains as it reduces inflammation.


Fill a tub with hot water, then add two tablespoons of vinegar. Soak your feet in the tub for about 20 minutes.
 Epsom salt can help soothe your feet, giving you instant relief from foot pain. Combining heat and Epsom salts, which is primarily magnesium, works well to relax the feet and ease pain.


Put two to three tablespoons of Epsom salt in a tub of warm water.
Soak your feet in the tub for 10 to 15 minutes.
The salt can make your feet dry, so apply some moisturizer after soaking them.

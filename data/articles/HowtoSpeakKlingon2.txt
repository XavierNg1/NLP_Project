 The most thorough and well-known group is The Klingon Language Institute,but you can also find other fan groups by doing an Internet search. Access the free information provided by these groups to determine if you are really interested in learning the language. Some of these groups also offer official membership, which will provide you with greater access to more information and events.
 In this way, you can learn Klingon by example. Audio files will allow you to listen to how Klingon words need to be pronounced, and video files will help you see how the mouth needs to be formed in order to produce such sounds.
 You can purchase one online or at a bookstore, or you can find a dictionary free for download. A Klingon language dictionary will work like most other language dictionaries. Most will have a Klingon to English section as well as an English to Klingon section, so that you will be able to translate terms and phrases both ways.
 You can brush up on these letters by researching more online and in Klingon language books. Once you feel comfortable with the new alphabet, you can download a font that uses this alphabet for any digital Klingon communications you need to make.
 A good way to practice any language is to get plenty of practice reading it. You can download or purchase books, magazines, poems, and short stories written in Klingon. Some of these books even include works previously written in other languages. Or you can read books translated from the original Klingon, like Shakespearean plays.

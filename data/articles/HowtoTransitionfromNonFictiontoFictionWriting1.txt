 In some ways, this aspect of writing fiction is not so different from nonfiction, because you’re still telling a story in nonfiction.


In both places, you are building tension throughout the story by releasing information little by little, until you reach the climax.
However, in fiction, it’s all about the story, whereas in nonfiction, the story may be secondary to other essential information.;
, Whether you are writing a short story or a novel, having a plan will help you get started.


Outline how characters meet and what happens to move the plot along.
Outlining your fiction will help you make sure your work continues moving at a steady pace.
 What will be the crux of the story? What is its central point? You will be moving towards the climax throughout your whole story, so make sure it is well developed.


A climax could be a sudden realization, a couple coming together, a car crash, a death, etc.
Make sure your climax flows naturally with the story.
Although the climax should conclude a period of suspense, it should not come out of nowhere.
 Though it depends on the writer, many writers feel the story does better if they have a general idea of where it will go, but leave some things open ended.


That way, you’ll make discoveries along the way.
If you are surprised, then your reader will be, too.
 The setting is important, but if you use focus too much on the setting, your readers will skip over it to get to the plot.


In all fiction writing, the plot is the backbone of the piece.
Without a well-developed plot taking center stage, fiction loses its sense of purpose and drive.

 Many people mistakenly believe it is better to adopt a Rottweiler puppy if you already have children. The rationale is that the puppy will adjust to the kids and their playfulness better than an adult dog.


Rottweiler puppies and children can be a difficult mix. The puppies have a ton of energy and are constantly nipping and biting at things. This can create problems when the puppy accidentally bites one of the kids or chews up the children’s favorite toys.
The other challenge with adopting a puppy is that you have no idea how the dog will behave as an adult. It might develop a difficult disposition that clashes with your family.
An adult Rottweiler’s personality and temperament are already developed, making it easier to observe how a particular Rottie will interact with and respond to your kids. With an adult dog, it is easier to select one that is a good fit for your family.;
, Just like any other puppy, Rottweiler pups enjoy chewing while teething and during playtime. They can end up destroying furniture, blankets, shoes, and other cherished items. Most adult Rotties will have already outgrown this behavior so there is less risk of your things being chewed up., While all puppies need to be house trained, Rottweilers are extremely energetic and can easily create havoc in your home. In addition to being taught to go to the bathroom outside, puppies also need to learn how to play appropriately inside. Otherwise, your new pup is likely to jump on the furniture, knock things over, and even destroy things. If you can’t be home during the day to train a Rottweiler puppy, your best bet is to adopt an adult., Older Rottweilers that end up in shelters or with rescue organizations might have been neglected or abused prior to being rescued.Unfortunately, adult Rottweilers can miss out on adoption because many people are looking to adopt or purchase puppies only. Adopting an adult Rottie is a great way to save a dog that would otherwise miss out on a great home.

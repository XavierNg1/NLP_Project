 Place strong-smelling fruits and vegetables in a pot and cover them with water. Simmer the pot over low heat to create a fresh spring smell. You can leave the pot on the stove to create a smell, as long as you check the water once in awhile and replace it as necessary. Also, do not leave anything on your stove if you leave your home. Store your ingredients in a mason jar in your fridge when you're done creating the smell. Simmer pot ingredients last about two to three weeks when stored in this fashion.Citrus fruit, such as lemon and oranges, work well.
Vegetables like cucumber often have a strong odor.
For an added scent, add herbs like basil, thyme, or rosemary.
 Squeeze the juice out of a citrus fruit, such as an orange or lemon, into some water. Transfer the water to a spray bottle to make your own citrus spray. You can use your spray to spritz the air in a room or the furniture to create a pleasant citrus scent.If you spray your furniture, do a test patch first on a small, unnoticeable portion. Make sure the spray does not cause any damage to the furniture.
The amount of juice varies based on your preference, but more juice creates a stronger scent.
 Lime and mint create a strong, fresh scent together. Try mixing lime juice, either fresh squeezed or store-bought, and add some fresh mint. Transfer the mixture to a jar and set it out opened in a room to freshen up the smell.If you have pets or young children, make sure to place your jar out of their reach.
Throw this out at the end of the day. You can make a new one for tomorrow if you liked the smell.
 For a simple, DIY air freshener, simply cut a citrus fruit in half and empty out the fruit to get the bowl-shaped rind. Place something like sea salt in the rind to weigh it down. You can also add fresh herbs, like basil. Set your air freshener down in a room to create a fresh, natural scent.

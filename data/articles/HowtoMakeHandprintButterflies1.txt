 Use a paintbrush or a foam brush to apply a thick coat of paint to your palm and fingers. You can use tempera or poster paint.;
, Point your palm towards the middle of the paper and your fingers to the side. Keep your fingers closed for a simple butterfly, or spread them open for a fancier one. You can use any type of paper you want. White printer paper works just as well as construction paper.









Try blue construction paper. It'll look like your butterfly is on the sky.
 Wash the paint off of your hand first, then paint your other hand with the same color. Make a second handprint right next to the first one with the palms touching.
 The thumbs on your first set will be pointing upwards. The thumbs on your second set should be pointing down. Have the palms on all prints meet in the middle. You can use the same color of paint as before, or a different one.
 Paint the side of your palm and pinky with black or brown paint. Press it against the paper, right between the wings to make the body of the butterfly.








You can also make the body by painting your thumb and making a row of dots., Wash your hand first, then paint your thumb the same color as the body. Press it against the paper, right above the body, for the head.









You can glue tiny googly eyes onto the head., You can also use a pipe cleaner instead. Simply bend a black pipe cleaner into a V, then curl the ends. Glue the antenna right above the head.
 Glue some gems, buttons, sequins, or beads onto the wings. If you want a simpler butterfly, use your fingers and paint to make spots instead. Here are some more ideas:









Decorate the butterfly with foam stickers.Draw designs with glitter glue.
Glue black or brown pompoms along the body to make it fluffy.Draw clouds, a sun, and a rainbow behind the butterfly.
 Once it dries, hang it up on your wall or in your window.

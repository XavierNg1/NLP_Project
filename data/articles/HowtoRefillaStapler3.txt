The refill cartridge should be matched to the particular model of printer or copier you use.
While the staples may be of similar size to each other, the cartridges are designed uniquely for your office equipment.
 The printer staples will be found within the finishing unit of your printer or copier. You will usually be able to release the stapler cartridge by lowering it from its location within the finisher.Look for any necessary tabs that you may need to press to release the cartridge.
Refer to your product manual for more details on how to locate the finisher.

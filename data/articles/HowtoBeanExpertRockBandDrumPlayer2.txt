 Don't worry about the impossible songs, they are only a challenge so you won't get bored, but are actually pretty impossible.
 When you're ready, move on to hard mode.
 You will soon want to move on to expert, but you shouldn't do this until you feel your hands respond without thinking. This normally happens around the 3rd day you've been playing on hard mode. If it doesn't, just keep practicing. Remember that there are some people that have the rhythm already in their heads, and some that need rhythm to be introduced little by little.

 Focus on savoring the moment or experience in everything you do, whether it be eating, driving, reading, or making love. Think completely and only about what you are doing in the here and now.Turn off the music when you drive sometimes and just focus on the drive. Spend some time eating without being on your phone or watching television.
 Though many people pride themselves on being good multitaskers, the reality is that the quality of what you are doing is often degraded when doing more than one thing at once. Try to focus only on one thing at a time and do that to the best of your ability.Make a list of everything you need to do and number them based on what you would like to complete first, second, third and so forth. Do only that one task at a time.
 When you wake up in the morning, spend some time breathing deeply and reflecting on how you’re feeling, rather than simply springing up and getting ready immediately. Meditate in your car on the way to your destination or at night when you return home.


You can start meditating by focusing on a certain word or phrase like “gratefulness” or “I have a good life.”
You can also meditate on a nice, quiet walk after dinner.
 Yoga is a form of exercise that also incorporates meditation. Find some yoga classes or a yoga studio near you, or watch some videos online and do it at home. Yoga will help you become more mindful of yourself as opposed to always thinking outwardly about others and other experiences.
 Spend some time each day doing something small that is just for you. This will help ensure that you have something to look forward to for yourself. It doesn’t have to be something large as long as you do something.Perhaps you will treat yourself to ice cream or watch one of your favorite shows when you get home.
Once per month, you might want to buy yourself something new.

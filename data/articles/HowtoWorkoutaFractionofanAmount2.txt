 When a problem asks you what fraction one whole number is of another whole number, you need to create a fraction and reduce it. Look for the key phrases “fraction of” or “out of.”For example, if the problem asks, “What fraction of 294{\displaystyle 294} is 245{\displaystyle 245},” you need to create a fraction from the two given whole numbers.
 The numerator is the fraction of the whole. Often this will be the smaller number, but not always, so read the problem carefully. The denominator is the “complete” number. Look for the key phrase “fraction of x{\displaystyle x}.” The x{\displaystyle x} variable will be the denominator.For example, if the problem asks, “What fraction of 294{\displaystyle 294} is 245{\displaystyle 245},” you know that 245{\displaystyle 245} is the numerator, because this is the number that is a part, or fraction, of 294{\displaystyle 294}. So the fraction is 245294{\displaystyle {\frac {245}{294}}}.
 To do this, find the greatest factor that is common to the numerator and the denominator, then divide each by that factor. For complete instructions on how to reduce fractions, read Reduce Fractions.

For example, the greatest common factor of 245{\displaystyle 245} and 294{\displaystyle 294} is 49{\displaystyle 49}:245÷49=5{\displaystyle 245\div 49=5}, so the reduced numerator is 5{\displaystyle 5}.294÷49=6{\displaystyle 294\div 49=6}, so the reduced denominator is 6{\displaystyle 6}.So, 245{\displaystyle 245} is 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}} of 294{\displaystyle 294}.

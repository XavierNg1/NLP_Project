 This butter may also have 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh herbs such as rosemary, parsley, chives, basil, sage or oregano.


This butter may be used immediately, or chilled for further use. It can taste strongly of garlic, so use according to the guest. For a mellow flavour, roast or gently fry your garlic first.

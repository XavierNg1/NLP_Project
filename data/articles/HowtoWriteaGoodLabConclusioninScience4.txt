 To provide an accurate depiction of the lab experiment, describe errors that may have happened in the course of the experiment. This will add credibility to your experiment and results., There may be uncontrollable circumstances that impact your experiment, such as weather changes or unavailability of a certain supply. Discuss these uncertainties and their potential impact on the overall experiment.


If your experiment raised questions that your collected data can’t answer, discuss this here.
 In light of what you learned in your experiment, give recommendations on the design of future experiments. What could be changed to elicit more reliable or valid results?

, Sometimes, scientific research trials will generate more questions than answers. If this is the case in your research, you can discuss these in the conclusion in the context for future research.
 Particularly for more advanced lab reports, you may choose to discuss how your research adds to the research in the field. Visualize all research on your topic as a brick wall, and your own research is one brick in that wall. How does your research fit within the overall scheme of things? Describe what is new or innovative about your research.
This can often set you apart from your classmates, many of whom will just write up the barest of discussion and conclusion.
 Wrap up the entire conclusion – and the entire report – with a statement that summarizes the scope of the lab report and the most important conclusions. Alternately, speculate on future uses for the research. Here is your chance to make an insightful comment that will set your lab report apart from others.

You are responsible for making sure that all of your healthcare providers are aware of both your pregnancy and your depression so that they can devise the best course of treatment for you. Do not be afraid to ask questions; taking charge of your own care and improvement can help you tailor a coping plan that best fits your personality and wishes.;

If you are severely depressed or if you struggled with depression prior to your pregnancy and utilized medication, your healthcare provider may recommend certain anti-depressants that have been approved for use in pregnant women. In some cases, the dose or frequency of the medication must be adjusted, so it may take time to find an effective treatment.
If you would like to manage your depression without medication or if you are experiencing a milder form of depression, you may wish to discuss options for psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy with your provider.
 In addition to or in place of medication, your provider may be able to point you toward natural treatments such as hydrotherapy, prenatal massage, aromatherapy, meditation, or acupuncture.

 You will need two plastic containers (16 oz), two packets of Knox Gelatine, a measuring cup, cooking spray, and water.
 Add both packets to one container. Measure 3/4 cup of water into the measuring cup.
 Stir the mixture with a spoon slowly to keep air bubbles from forming. Place the stirred mixture into a refrigerator for 3-4 hours.
 Place the chilled container into the hot water for about 15 minutes to melt the set gelatin back into a liquid.


If the water is not hot enough, the gelatin will not melt back down to liquid form. Heat water on a stove if necessary.
 While the gel is melting, spray the second container with the cooking spray. If you don’t have access to cooking spray, any non-stick oil will work.
 Slowly pour the melted gel to keep air bubbles from forming under the surface. Place the gel back in fridge and let it cool for 12 hours.
 Once the gel has set, you can knock it out of the container. It should easily fall out in one piece, thanks to the cooking spray.
 Place the gel on a flat stable surface and shoot it with the airsoft or pellet gun. Shoot from about 10 feet (3.0 m) away.


Always follow proper safety procedures when handling fierarms.

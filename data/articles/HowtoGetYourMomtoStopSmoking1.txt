 The truth is, even though your mom probably knows you better than anyone, she may not fully realize the impact that her smoking has had on you. If you are concerned with her health and wish to protect yourself and others from the effects of secondhand smoke, the most direct way to handle this is through open communication.


Schedule some time to talk in a comfortable, private environment. No one enjoys being confronted about their habits. By going to a private place, such as a bedroom or sitting room, mom may be able to let her guard down and hear what you need to say.
Try not to nag or blame your mom for her smoking habit. Try to be compassionate, gentle and understanding.
Be sure to listen well. There may be some unexpressed feelings or perhaps she has tried to quit in the past and was unsuccessful. Hearing her out can ultimately make her more open to quitting.;
, If your mom is particularly defensive about her smoking habit, writing her a clear, thoughtful letter can allow you to get all of your feelings out in the open without her feeling confronted or attacked. This way she can process the information on her own and respond once she is ready.


Try starting off with, “Mom, I’m writing you this letter because I love you and want the very best for you and our family.”
Or, “Mom, lately I have been thinking about our lifestyle and how we can improve our health together.”
”Mom, it is sometimes difficult for me to express my feelings in person, but I am worried about you. Just know that I will do whatever I can to help you to quit smoking. You don’t have to do this alone.”

, If you still have difficulty getting mom to listen, bringing in an adult peer, friend or family member may help grab her attention in ways that you may not be able.After all, many parents do struggle when it comes to hearing their child out (even when they are adults), so bringing in a trusted peer may get her to understand the dangers of smoking once and for all.

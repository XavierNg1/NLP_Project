 These articles might include things like hats, scarves, overlarge shirts, pants, sunglasses, and so on. Each team should have a complete set of clothing.


For example, if you have two teams you might collect two shirts, scarves, and hats for your race.
Many suitable articles of clothing like this can be purchased inexpensively from secondhand or thrift stores, like Salvation Army and Goodwill., Just like in a traditional crab race, you'll need to mark the start and finish and divide teams. If you have uneven teams, the team with one less player should choose one member to run the race twice.
 Each team should get one set of clothing apiece. Lay out these articles on the start line with a few feet (1 to 1.5 m) of distance between each team's collection of clothing articles.
 After you signal the start of the race ("Ready, set, go!"), players will put on the articles of clothing and race from the start to the finish and back again. When they return, they must take off the clothing and the next player must put it on before running the crab race.To make this game more challenging for older kids, you might add rules like, "You have to button all the buttons on the shirt at the start and unbutton them at the finish."

, Players should run the race one person at a time per team until all members have run the race. The first team to have all teammates complete the crab race clothing relay is the winner.

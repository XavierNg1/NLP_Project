 If you don't have that working yet, you just need to activate iMessages on your desktop or laptop.;
,,, If you're using a laptop, you can use two fingers on the touchpad at once to "right-click." If you have a mouse with two buttons, you can also right-click directly on it.
 You'll see a reaction menu pop up.
 You'll have a choice between a heart, thumbs up, thumbs down, "Ha Ha," exclamation points, or question mark.


As soon as you pick it, it'll send that reaction to your recipient. There's no need to hit send or click anything else.

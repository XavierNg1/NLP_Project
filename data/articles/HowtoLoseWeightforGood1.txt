 Don't think about it as a diet and exercise plan. If you are constantly thinking about your new way of eating as a diet plan, it can be more difficult for you to stay dedicated to the nutrition and the weight won't stay away for good. Try to shift the way you see your new routine from a diet and exercise routine you have to do to an active lifestyle with healthy nutrition that is just your new way of life.


Instead of thinking about all the food you can't have, find and incorporate some healthier versions of your favorite foods into your routine. This way, you will feel like you are treating yourself and you won't be tempted to cheat.;
, One of the first things you need to do when starting a weight loss plan is get rid of all the bad food in your house. Go through your fridge, freezer, pantry, and cabinets to get rid of all the temptation foods such as ice cream, candy, breaded and fried foods, chips, snack cakes, and other similar items. Replace them with healthy options such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains that still have some of your favorite flavors but that aren't so bad for you.If you have a family, try to get rid of these foods for them as well. They don't have to stick to the same routine as you, but eating healthier is a great option for anyone.
 If you have found it hard in the past to commit wholeheartedly to a diet and exercise plan, try doing it a step at a time. Sometimes the all or nothing approach can be overwhelming and frustrating and can cause you to give up before you really gave weight loss a chance. Try to make changes gradually, such as switching dishes in each meal for healthier options and adding in one or two days of exercise at first. Once your body gets used to the routine, you can add more and more steps until you are living an overall healthy lifestyle., Weight loss doesn't happen overnight. The healthiest weight loss that will stay off in the long run is about 1-2 pounds per week. This may seem slow, but if you work at it and make your overall lifestyle and routine healthy, you won't think of it as a weight loss plan anymore. It will just become how you live.


Don't get discouraged. The worst thing you can do is give up too early. Even if you eat badly for a day or so or if you skip working out for a few days, don't just throw in the towel. Just get back on to your nutrition and exercise plan and you will see results.

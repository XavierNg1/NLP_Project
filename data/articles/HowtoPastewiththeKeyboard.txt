 In order to paste, you will need to have something copied first. You can copy nearly anything on a computer, from text to images to files and folders. You can use keyboard shortcuts to copy as well: Ctrl+C in Windows and Linux or ⌘ Command+C in Mac OS X. Copying leaves the content in its original location and creates a copy to be pasted elsewhere.


You can cut instead of copy, which removes the content from the original location to be pasted in the new location. The keyboard shortcuts for cutting are Ctrl+X in Windows and Linux and ⌘ Command+X in Mac OS X.;
, When you paste with the keyboard, your content will be pasted wherever the cursor is active. If you are pasting text, make sure your cursor is located in the right spot in the document. If you are pasting files, ensure that the correct window is open and active.
 Once your cursor is in the right spot, press the keyboard shortcut to paste the content: Ctrl+V or ⇧ Shift+Insert in Windows and Linuxor ⌘ Command+V in Mac OS X.Your content will appear where your cursor is or, if you're copying files, at the end of your current directory.


If you're pasting files, it may take a while for the paste action to complete, especially if the files are large. A progress bar will show how long the copying process will take.

 They take 500 years to decompose and are responsible for over 4 million tons of landfill waste each year in the U.S alone.;
, Disposables, on the other hand, cost $15 a week, so in over 3 years, at least $2500 will go to waste as well.
, As far as good environmental practice goes, breast milk is definitely best. If you want to give your baby milk, you'll want to get it from the most local source.


Most mothers don't think they have the time to breastfeed on a regular basis, but they can express milk for later consumption, and once you get the hang of the process it shouldn't take any more time than it would take to make up the powdered formula, heating it up, and sterilizing the bottles when done (a process which also uses lots of energy).
 Making the food up from scratch whether it's mushy or solid is the best way to control a child's consumption of artificial additives.
 When purchasing the crib, dresser, and other furnishings for your baby's room, keep in mind that most people will buy everything brand new, but you don't need to do this.
 You can go to a local charity store. Another option is to contact a friend whose baby has just outgrown their crib and ask whether you can have theirs; it hasn't seen a great deal of action, after all.
 Search for items that are close to where you live so if you have to collect them personally, you won't be going through a full tank of gas on the journey there and back.
 The toys to offer them today are far more extravagant than they were just 20 years ago, to the point where they've become power-draining commodities themselves.
 They don't need fancy toys to be entertained. A simple game of patty cake or some time with the chunky soft building blocks is enough to keep a baby happy, and it increases parental bonds as well.
, A few pots, pans, and some wooden spoons will make a nice little drum set; just one example of how babies learn things through play.

 Once you see an Octorok, find a safe spot a great distance away from where the monster is.
 If you come within a few feet of the monster, it will immediately start shooting rocks at you. Your distance from the monster though should give ample time to react and sidestep out of the trajectory of the Octorokâ€™s projectiles.
 Press and hold the Action button where you currently have the bow and arrow equipped. Adjust your aim using the control keys on your controller, and release the Action button to shoot the monster. It takes only one or two arrows to defeat an Octorok.

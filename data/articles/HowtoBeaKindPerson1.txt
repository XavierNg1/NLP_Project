, Being kind becomes easier when you empathize with the experiences of others. Try to imagine yourself in the shoes of those around you and think of how your actions might affect them. Do things that you wish others would do for you, if you were in their shoes.Picturing yourself in other people’s shoes can making being kind seem less like something that requires effort and more like it’s simply the right thing to do.
 Being kind is much easier when things are going well, but when the going gets tough people often forget to consider the feelings of others. When you feel yourself getting angry or frustrated, take a timeout and try to calm yourself down.Controlling your temper is one of the most important elements of kindness.
Try counting to ten and taking long, deep breaths when you’re angry. Think about your words and actions, and how they may affect those around you, when you’re angry.
 When you distance yourself from your actions by justifying them as vengeance or deserved, you allow yourself to be unkind for selfish reasons. Instead of telling yourself that the way you act towards others is deserved with it’s negative, take responsibility for the way you treat others.


Don’t convince yourself that negative things you do or say are acceptable because you feel slighted.
You can’t control the actions of others, but you can control how you react to them. Being kind is a choice.

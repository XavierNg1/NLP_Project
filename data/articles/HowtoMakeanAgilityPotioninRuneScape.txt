Collect a toadflax herb. Invest in clean toadflax for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy toadflax herbs are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.
Purchase a vial. Acquire water-filled vial packs to save you time. Any unused vials can be stored in your bank for later usage.
Collect a toad leg. Toad legs can be obtained by travelling to the Gnome Stronghold and removing the legs from a swamp toad.
 This will create a "Toadflax Potion (unf)".
 This will create a three dose agility potion.

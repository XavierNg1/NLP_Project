 This is also called a “block watch”, “apartment watch”, “home watch”, or “community watch”. These programs organize communities to work together with local police to manage crime in their areas. The three primary components of these programs are watching for suspicious activities, marking property to indicate ownership, and home security surveys.Nightly citizen patrols, victim support, and close communication with authorities all may be employed with these organizations.
Such programs have been started all over the country. Maybe one already exists in your community. These organizations don't require frequent meetings (once a month or so). They don't ask anyone to take personal risks to prevent crime. They leave the responsibility for catching criminals where it belongs - with the police.
These are not "vigilante" groups. These groups gather citizens together to learn crime prevention from local authorities. You cooperate with your neighbors to report suspicious activities in the neighborhood, to keep an eye on homes when the resident is away, and to keep everyone in the area mindful of the standard precautions for property and self that should always be taken. Criminals often avoid neighborhoods where such groups exist.

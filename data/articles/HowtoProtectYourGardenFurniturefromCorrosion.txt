 Both of these methods will coat your garden furniture with zinc, which is a sacrificial metal that will corrode first before the iron or steel does.


Cleanse it from any existing rust through a shot blasting process or immersing the affected parts in an alkali/acid bath.

Finally, it will be coated with a passive Chromate coat.;
, To take care of the protective coating of your iron and steel pieces, avoid scratching them, this would create an exposed surface of corrodible material. Even the slightest exposed area is enough to start off a chain reaction of corrosion in your garden furniture, so you should be very careful.
 Another good measure to protect your stuff from corrosion is to have a good drainage system installed so that your garden doesn’t store up excess water. This can lead to damp conditions, perfect for creating rusty iron and steel.Try not to leave your furniture on damp grass, this will certainly contribute to the corrosion of the legs of your chairs, benches, tables, etc.
 Select your type of wood very carefully. Many woods rot easily in damp conditions. Many great designs exist for any type of material you may want to use .Don’t be afraid to explore your options!

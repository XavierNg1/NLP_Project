 Discuss and determine your relationship goals with one another. Being on the same page with each other about the future of your relationship, whether that is marriage or partnership, children, or simply cohabitation, will ultimately strengthen your relationship and sort out priorities.


If you both have different ideas of what your future holds, as in one of you wants a long-term cohabiting relationship and the other doesn’t, then it might be best to end the relationship sooner than later., Moving in together is a big step and many people take time to overcome their reservations about cohabitation. Acknowledge your boyfriend’s experience and desires and give him space and time to come around. Giving him his space to sort out his resistance will show your care and commitment to the relationship.


Avoid pressuring him into “wanting” to live together. Cohabitation is a big commitment and should be a mutual decision.
Respecting your boyfriend’s space does not mean forgetting about moving in together. Be sure to set a time to return to the conversation after he’s had time to think about it.
 Finances can control a significant amount of timing in a relationship. You may not be in a place financially stable enough to move out of where you currently live, or one of you might make significantly more than the other. Whatever the issue or imbalance, discussing your finances will help you both be on the same page about the possibility of moving in together.Lay out all of your financial information: credit score, credit card debt or student loans, income, assets, and other financial obligations.Discuss how the rent and bills will be divided. Remember, fair is not always equal.

 The abortion laws in Northern Ireland are different than the rest of the U.K. and termination is only permitted in very specific circumstances. An abortion is only permitted if the pregnancy poses serious, permanent damage to the mother’s life or mental health. In Northern Ireland, rape, incest, and fatal fetal abnormalities are not sufficient grounds for obtaining a legal abortion.In addition, abortions can only be performed at or below 9 weeks of pregnancy.A total of 16 abortions were performed legally within Northern Ireland from 2014 to 2015., Although Northern Ireland has stringent abortion laws, it is legal to travel to another country in the U.K. to have an abortion.In 2014, 837 women were reported to have traveled to England from Northern Ireland to receive an abortion., Although a resident of Northern Ireland can travel to the rest of the U.K. to have an abortion, that does not mean that they will receive free medical care under the NHS. If you live in Northern Ireland, you will have to pay for travel, accommodations, and the cost of the procedure at a private clinic. These expenses can total around £900 or more.Marie Stopes U.K. is an independent, private sexual healthcare provider in the U.K. They offer discounted prices for women traveling from Northern Ireland to other regions of the U.K.Contact a specialist at the Belfast Marie Stopes U.K. office to discuss your options.

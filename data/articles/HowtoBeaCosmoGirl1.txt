 I learned this one from my mum - for a voluminous conditioner, mix 2 eggs with milk until frothy, add 2 teaspoons of mayo (yes, mayonnaise) and some honey to cover up the smell and give a healthy glow! Rinse with cold-ish water and towel dry. (only use every 2 weeks max) Here's some more tips...;
,, Examples of hair types:- layered, bangs, bob, feathered, short, mid-length, long, fly-away,teased, razored, curly, straight, etc.
 People won't trust you, same for all these rules so rinse, lather and repeat! Don't think your hair is the best either, but still have confidence.
 My opinion is to keep it natural but maybe add highlights. Theyâ€™re in the know right now! Brunettes and redheads look also fabulous too!

, Please get them waxed and pluck them every 3-7 days, it doesn't hurt. You kinda get used to it after the first wax! Same as plucking! Only the first time hurts.

Whenever you find yourself self-talking aloud, lower your volume to a level that you are comfortable with and that is not disruptive to those around you. Although thinking out loud is good for your thought process, you do not want to be a nuisance.If you want to help your brain work through a task or memorize a certain bit of information, you might whisper to yourself in a soft tone or go somewhere where you can talk out loud.
 In some places, thinking out loud may not be appropriate. For example, if you are studying in a quiet library, speaking out loud may earn you some glares. In that case, try going somewhere, like a park, where you can think out loud.


If you need to work through something out loud, consider doing it at home or in your office. Find a space where you will not distract other people.

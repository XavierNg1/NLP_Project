 Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of cooking oil to a large skillet or wok and heat over high heat until smooth and glossy.


Gently turn the pan to coat the bottom with oil. There should be no dry spots left in the pan as you add the ingredients.
 Stir the ingredients, coating them in oil, and fry gently until they begin to soften.


This should only take about 2 to 3 minutes.
Watch the garlic carefully as you cook it. Garlic burns relatively easily, and once it burns, the flavor of your sauce can be ruined.
 Decrease the heat to medium and cook the sauce mixture until it thickens and reduces by roughly three quarters.


This, too, will only take about 2 to 3 minutes.
Once reduced, add a dash of salt and a dash of black pepper, to taste, and stir the seasonings in well.
 Remove the sauce mixture from the heat and let it cool until it becomes cool enough to touch.


The sauce may need to cool for 5 to 10 minutes before you can transfer it to your blender.
 Pour half of the thick, chunky sauce into a blender and blend at a high speed for 10 to 20 seconds. Gradually add the remaining 3/4 cup (190 ml) of cooking oil as you blend the ingredients together.


The consistency should be smooth and thin. If the garlic sauce is clumpy in some parts but runny in others, the oil may not have blended in correctly. Continue blending the sauce longer until this imbalance evens out.
 Add the liquified sauce back the the skillet of chunky sauce. Stir well and let cool completely.


The flavors will settle as the sauce cools, so even if you plan to use it immediately for a hot dish, you should still let it cool first before using it.
 You can serve the sauce immediately or pour it into a glass jar and store it for two weeks.


This garlic sauce works especially well when served with shellfish, in stir-fries, or with Chinese-inspired dishes.

 The fist consideration is how large and how many SD cards you should need.

Size.16GB SD cards are your best option as they won't fill up straightaway , and they are not too large, so if something goes wrong your footage will be spread out across the cards.
Speed. At least class 6.
How many?. Get more cards than you are going to need for one camera at least 6 16GB (each records 44 minutes) which will give you just under 3 hours filming and if you are filming with two cameras get twice as many cards.
Label cards clearly.;

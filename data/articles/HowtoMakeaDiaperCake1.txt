 Most diaper packages have a see through side panel or a picture of the diaper on which you can see the design on the diapers. Buying diapers with a colorful design will enhance the fun look of the cake.;
, Roll up a diaper, starting at the "open" top end. Wrap a rubber band around the rolled diaper to stop it from unrolling. Again, using colorful rubber bands can be a nice touch.This diaper will form the center of the layer.


An alternative is to use a baby bottle as the center of the top layer.
 Place them around the center diaper (or baby bottle) so that they are all evenly spaced. Keep them together by placing a large rubber band around all of the diapers. Large rubber bands can be purchased at your local office supply store.The rolled up diapers should form a circle.
 Again, this can be a rolled up diaper or some oblong gift (such as a bottle of baby lotion). Roll up 15 more diapers and place them around the centerpiece. Secure them with a large rubber band.
 Place a rolled up diaper or a gift (perhaps a toy or rolled up piece of baby clothing) in the center. Roll up 30 diapers, securing each with its own rubber band. Place them around the centerpiece and secure with a large rubber band. For the base, make another middle layer. Then add about 30 more diapers around it using a larger rubber band.
 Next, carefully stack the other two layers on top of the base layer, being careful to get the dowels between the diapers and not through any of the diapers.

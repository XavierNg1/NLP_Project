 You should do this to remove the excess saltiness. Put the halloumi into cold water. The least amount of time you should let it soak is two hours, but it is also okay to allow it to soak overnight., Use a knife to cut the halloumi into long slices that would be the ideal size and length for skewers. Once the slices have been made, thread them onto the skewers. The amount of cheese that you cut depends on the amount of people that you want to serve, though the amount of ingredients used in this recipe is made to serve four to six people.Use metal skewers or wooden skewers that have soaked in water for ten minutes.
You can find skewers at most supermarkets.
 Drizzle the skewered halloumi with two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Make sure that the olive oil is evenly distributed over the cheese., Use a pinch of both the oregano and black pepper. Evenly sprinkle the ingredients over the halloumi cheese.
 You will need an outdoor barbecue to grill the halloumi skewers. If you don’t have an outdoor barbecue, you can use a hot griddle pan. The hot griddle pan will work just as well to grill the halloumi.
 Do this after they have been skewered and sprinkled. Grill for two to three minutes on each side., Remove the skewers off of the barbecue and put them onto plates or a tray. Serve them with the sauce of your choice, or no sauce at all if you don’t want it. A few sauces that pair well with this recipe are smoky pepper tomato salsa, creamy Aji green sauce, and chimichurri sauce.If you don’t want to make your own sauce, look for a premade sauce, like the salsa, at your local grocery store.

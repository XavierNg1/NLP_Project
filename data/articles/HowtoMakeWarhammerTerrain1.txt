 You will need dedicated bins for supplies, and a surface that you can cut, glue and paint on. You are very likely to create a mess, and will be working with a number of materials that can be hazardous or dangerous to leave around children or pets.;
, The board should be rigid, light and thin.It should be thin enough to cut with a knife. The base must be big enough to support your entire object.
 Use a pencil to make the desired shape. It is best to have an idea of the best shape and size for your terrain. If you are just building a base for a tree, a round shape will be most efficient. If you are doing a cubic building, you will probably want something that is more square. You may need to take some measurements of your terrain object before creating the base.
 You can use scissors to cut out the shape on a cardboard base. If you have a thicker material like plywood, you might need to use a sharp knife to cut.
 A painterâ€™s tape works well to hide the rough edges, especially if you use cardboard as your material. Do not use a tape with a glossy, non-stick surface. You want the paint to be able to stick.
 You can choose a green color for natural grass look or gray for a rock or concrete type of texture. Choose something appropriate to your piece and then apply it over the entire surface.


Do not use a water-based paint or glue on terrain bases. These paints shrink when drying and can warp the surface of the base.

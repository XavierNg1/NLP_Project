 If you do not want to try natural remedies or pay for surgical removal of your moles, you can try to use make up to hide your moles. Layer a concealer on top of your moles using a Q-tip or a concealer with a fine tip.


You can also try using specific make up products to hide your moles. For example, a concealer made for hiding tattoos can also be used on your moles, as well as tattoo “eraser” products, which are formulated to hide dark markings on your skin., If you have moles on your forehead or above your eyebrows, you may want to consider growing out your bangs so you can cover the moles with your hair. If you have moles on your neck or around your jawline, you may opt for a long hair look so your moles are less noticeable in these areas.
 If you have tried several home remedies to try to remove the mole and they do not work, you may want to consider embracing your moles. Though moles may appear unsightly to you, many beautiful men and women in fashion and art have moles on their body. Their moles were viewed as a sign of beauty and gave them a signature look. You can also try to view your moles this way and see them as a sign of attraction, not something to be hidden or removed.

 It might seem counter-intuitive to cut your hair while you're trying to grow it out, but it will help your hair look good while it grows. Visit your stylist every 6 to 8 weeks and ask him or her to trim only as much as you need to keep the ends healthy.
 If possible, lay off on blow-drying, straightening or curling your hair when you can. If you must style your hair this way, purchase a good heat protection agent (ask your stylist for suggested brands). Also do your best to rinse your hair with not-so-hot water (it doesn't have to be freezing), and try to brush/comb it as little as possible while still wet after a shower., The general wisdom is that you ought to grow out the front of your hair first while keeping the back short. Talk to your hair stylist about it for added input. With long hair in the front, there are usually many more styles to choose from. Unless you have your heart set on transitioning right back into shoulder- or arm-length hair, go for a trimmed back for access to more styles.


Consider extensions if you just can't stand to manage your growing hair any longer, have them added if you can afford it. More than a few celebrities have gone this route after having to trim down their hair for a role., Unfortunately, there's no way to make your hair grow out overnight. View your hair as a work in progress, and turn your attention to what you can do with it now instead of what you can't.

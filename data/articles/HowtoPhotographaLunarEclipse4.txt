 The telephoto technique relies on a long zoom to take a photo with a large appearance of the moon. It is best to use a long telephoto lens or telescope. A point and shoot camera can be used if the zoom lens is 6x or more.A point and shoot camera can be used, but it will not fill the frame of the photo like a SLR (single-lens reflex) or DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) camera.A lot of telescopes will allow you to connect a camera with an adapter.
 You will need to use a larger than usual tripod if you’re using a telephoto lens or telescope. In this case, a makeshift tripod probably won’t work., The focal length determines how large the moon will appear in your photo. The moon size will appear larger with a larger lens.An SLR photo with a 50mm lens produces photo with a moon size of 0.5mm across. This is probably too small.
A 200mm lens will make the moon appear 1.8mm across.
A 500mm lens produces a moon size of 4.6mm across. The lenses cost between $100 to $250.
DSLR cameras follow almost the same rules about lens size, but then lens can be smaller than an SLR camera’s lens and produce a larger moon size. A 750mm lens in a DSLR camera will produce the same moon size as a 740mm lens in an SLR camera.
 Bracketing photos means taking two extra photos at different brightness levels for every photo you take. It is best to take a bracketed series of exposures every ten to fifteen minutes.Consult the Lunar Eclipse Exposure guide to determine how to time your exposures. This guide will tell you how to change your camera’s settings for the different stages of the lunar eclipse. http://www.mreclipse.com/LEphoto/image/LE-Exposure1w.GIF

The exposure times will depend on the specific eclipse you are photographing.

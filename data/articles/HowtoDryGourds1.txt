 Mature gourds can handle frost and can even withstand a few cycles of freezing and thawing. As the plant turns brown and dies, the gourds dry and fall off.If the gourds have matured by the end of the growing season but have not had time to dry, you can leave them on the vine over winter. When the snow melts and exposes them in the spring, they will continue drying where they left off in the fall. However, there is a risk that they will rot if you leave them over winter.;
, Dried gourds are lightweight and hollow. Listen for the sound of seeds rattling around inside. Sometimes, however, the seeds stick to the inside of the gourd before drying and do not rattle. The seeds can be used for other uses as stock

, If they are still attached to the plant, you can cut the vine flush with the gourd or leave a piece of stem intact--leaving the gourd is purely ornamental when you dry the gourd on the vine.
 No matter how you choose to dry gourds, a small percentage of them will always rot--be prepared for this.

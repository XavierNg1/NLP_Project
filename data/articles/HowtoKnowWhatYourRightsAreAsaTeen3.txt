 Although schools can largely dictate their own dress codes, if you are a transgender student, you may have greater freedom to dress in a way that matches your gender identity. Because of increasing legal pressure, many schools in the United States are rewriting their dress codes to accommodate transgender students., As a gay or lesbian student, your school cannot prohibit your from bringing a same-sex partner to any school dances or events. While at the dance, the school must ensure your safety like it does all of the other students. Also, school officials cannot limit your public displays of affection more than they limit a straight studentâ€™s., As a LGBTQA youth, you will likely experience some form of bullying. However, most states have anti-bullying legislation on the books that protect LGBTQA students. If you are being bullied by another student or school official, it is your right to take legal action against them.Schools can be considered liable if they do not adequately protect LGBTQA students.
 You have a right to use the restroom that reflects your gender identity. However, if you are transgender, many schools in the United States may still prevent you from using facilities that align with your gender identity. You may want to talk with school administrators or a guidance counselor before entering a bathroom that does not align with your birth gender.

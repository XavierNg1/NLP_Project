 Try to put the sheet in the cold water as soon as you notice the stain to ensure that the tanner does not soak too deeply. Let the cold water run on the side of the sheet that did not get the tanner on it until the water runs clear., Use a clean cloth with dishwashing soap on it to gently rub and clean the area of the stain.To keep the tanner from spreading be sure to rub just over the stain without pushing too hard on the sheet., Wash the sheets in the washer on a warm cycle with an addition of white specific stain remover.The stain remover will ensure that any remaining tanner that the cloth did not clean will come off easily while in the wash. Once washed, dry the sheets either on a clothes line or in the dryer., If there is any tanner still present on the sheets, a last resort may be to soak it overnight in a mixture of cold water and oxygen-based bleach and repeat the washing and drying process. The white sheet should now be completely clean.Test the bleach on a small area of the sheet before you soak it all to make sure the material wonâ€™t be damaged by the bleach.Take caution when handling bleach as it can be dangerous to humans and animals. Use it in a well ventilated area and do not breathe it in. Also, make as minimal contact as possible between your skin and the bleach.

, For beginners, it is not necessary to have a boot with a lot of padding on the tongue or extra hooks. Three hooks should be enough.
 It is sufficient to have about 3 or 4 picks.
 Check that the heel of the boot fits firmly around your ankle. Your ankle will direct your foot in the curving and turning when you learn this. The boot should also fit firmly from heel to toe.
 This can be hard work and they won't feel very comfortable at first. The answer to this is to break them in in short bursts and build up. Even wearing them around the house or watching TV (with guards on) helps to break them in faster.

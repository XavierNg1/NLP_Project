 There are several products on the market designed to lift and remove tar. Before using one of these products, first spot-test it on an inconspicuous area of carpet. If it doesn’t discolor or stain the carpet, follow the instructions on the bottle and use it on the tar stain.


Most tar removers are in the form of a thick liquid that you will apply to the stained area, then dab with a clean cloth.
 Most people don’t realize that WD-40 can act as a powerful stain remover! To use WD-40 on the stain, spray it directly over the stained area. Let the WD-40 sit for around ten minutes so it can penetrate the stained fibers of the carpet, then use a clean cloth to blot at the area using gentle sponging motions. Blot until you stop lifting any stain or until the entire stain is lifted.After using the WD-40, make a mixture of one part dish soap and one part water, then dip a clean cloth in the soap solution and dab at the area to remove the WD-40.WD-40 generally does not stain, but if you are worried about it further staining your carpet, spray test an inconspicuous area of carpet with a small amount of WD-40, then let it sit for about five minutes. If you do not notice any discoloration, it is safe to use.
 Brake cleaner is another product that is not designed as a stain remover, but can do a great job breaking down and lifting tar stains. Spot the test brake cleaner before using, then spray it directly over the tar stain. Use a clean cloth to blot and lift any remnants of the stain.

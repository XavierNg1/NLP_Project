Typically, however, a judge will only do this to protect children and victims of abuse or to keep sensitive information like Social Security numbers private. Most information should be public record, including embarrassing accusations., Missouri has an online database of court records. You can use it to search by name or location for cases. Not all local courts, however, are integrated into the database. For cases tried in some locations you will need to visit the court.
 You should visit the courthouse at which the case was held. You will typically be asked to fill out a request form. To find the locations and phone numbers of Missouri courts, visit the Missouri courts website.

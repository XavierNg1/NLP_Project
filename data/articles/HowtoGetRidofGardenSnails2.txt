 You want to draw out the snails before you hand pick them. Do this early in your garden’s season before the snails have had time to lay eggs.
 Find a flashlight.
 This is where you will place the snails, unless you want to relocate them. Make sure the salty water doesn’t spill into your garden, or it will kill your plants.
 You can pluck the snails off plants easier than you would with gloves.
 Look under leaves, on leaves, under boards and around all of your plants. Pick up the snails one by one and plop them in the water.

 This variation on Milo is a popular breakfast drink for children in many parts of the world. For this recipe you will need:


5 tablespoons Milo powder
1.5 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk
Hot water
Cold milk

, You will only need a few tablespoons of water to dissolve the Milo powder. Boil the water in a kettle, or microwave it for 1-2 minutes, until it begins to steam.
 How much you use depends on how strong you like your Milo.
 Pour enough hot water into the glass to cover the Milo powder by about 3/4 inches. (Measuring boiling water is a dangerous process, so just eyeball this step.) Then stir, stir, stir until the powder is fully dissolved.
 This will sweeten the beverage, and add a very creamy, smooth texture to your beverage. Give the drink another quick stir.
 Give it one last stir, and drink it down. You can use lowfat or skim milk, here, but most Milo drinkers prefer to use whole milk.

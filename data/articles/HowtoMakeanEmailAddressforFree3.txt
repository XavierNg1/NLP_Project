 From this page, you will begin the process of creating a Yahoo ID with which you will be able to access your email account. This login page can also be accessed from the main yahoo.com site by clicking on the purple "mail" icon in the top right corner.
 Clicking on the blue button beneath the purple "Sign In" button will take you to the account creation page.
 On this page, you will be asked to provide your name, phone number, birthday, and sex. You'll also be asked to input a username (which, followed by "@yahoo.com", will also serve as your email address) and a password. When you're done, click "Create Account."


Your password must be 8 to 32 characters long. For added security, it must also contain numbers and upper and lowercase characters. Remember that your password is case-sensitive.
You can also optionally add a recovery phone number - a number that can be used to retrieve your username and/or password in the event you forget them.
 At the phone number you provided, you will receive an SMS (text message) containing a verification code for your account. Enter this code in the "Code" text box, then click "Submit code" to continue.


If the number you provided cannot receive SMS messages, you have the option of receiving an audio call from Yahoo with your code. Click the "call you" link in the text below the "Send SMS" button, then provide a phone number that can receive calls and click "Call me." Enter the code you receive in the designated box to proceed.
 You're finished! You will be automatically taken to your new email account page, where you will have the ability to browse and write emails.

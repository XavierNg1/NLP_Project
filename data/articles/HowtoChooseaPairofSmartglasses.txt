 Decide whether you simply want social integration, want to design or want to view immersive video. Depending on what you're looking for, the options and styles will vary.
 Some are designed to be worn frequently, and therefore won't obstruct your view; others are designed specifically for gaming or other virtual reality activities, but can't easily be worn outside of those settings., The more bells and whistles your smart glasses come with, the more expensive they will be., There are a few different kinds of smart glasses:

Augmented Reality glasses usually consist of a processor, display, lens(s) and frame. Information is then provided in supplement to what the wearer is seeing. These glasses project information into the line of sight of the wearer without fully-obstructing vision. 3D optical head-mounted displays (OHMD) are optical head-mounted displays in which computer powered glasses present information and graphics in a holographic, 3D display. These glasses are designed for artists, engineers and designers and not intended for daily use like standard augmented reality glasses.
Head-mounted video displays (HMVD) are glasses that fully obstruct vision and are designed for immersive video and gaming experiences. Often equipped with gyroscopes and accelerometers these glasses are designed to immerse the user in 3D world. These glasses are designed primarily for entertainment as opposed to design or supplemented reality.

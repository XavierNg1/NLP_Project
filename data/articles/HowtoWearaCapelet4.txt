Decide whether you want a piece for a special event or if you'd rather go with something more multi-purpose.
Ask yourself if you plan on using it to keep yourself warm or if you are more interested in it as an accessory.
These questions will help you choose the right fabric, design, and color when you shop.
 Your height and build can determine what length and shape will look best.


Short women should opt for short capelets that stop a few inches shy of the elbow.
Tall women should consider longer capelets that come past the elbow and extend down toward the hip.
Flowing capelets may look bulky on busty women, so these women should look at fitted caplets and fitted cape jackets.
On the other hand, women with flat to average chest sizes should consider a flowing, mantle-style capelet, perhaps with a belt tie at the waist to create a slimming silhouette.



If you plan on wearing your capelet a lot, go with a neutral color like black, white, brown, tan, or gray. You may also consider deep, muted colors like navy blue or forest green.
If selecting a capelet for one or two specific outfits, liven things up with color. Look at designs in gold, red, violet, or orange.

 Malfunctioning gutters, running water problems, and malfunctioning or misplaced sprinklers can all promote the growth and spread of mold and mildew. Address these issues to minimize the likelihood of having to deal with them again after youâ€™ve cleaned your siding.;
, Before you begin cleaning, see to it that electric units on and near the walls you are about to clean are turned off or unplugged. Cover outlets, sockets, and lighting to prevent electrocution and electrical malfunction.
 You can try a number of proven DIY and commercial cleaning solutions on your siding. A popular homemade option is to mix three (3) parts distilled white vinegar with seven (7) parts water in a bucket. If you prefer a commercial product, mix one (1) part bleach with four (4) parts water.
 Get a long-handled soft-bristle brush and dip it into the cleaning solution. Gently scrub any visible stain and mildew spots, working from top to bottom.
 Pour the cleaning solution into a power washer. If you are worried about damaging the vinyl, you may use a lower-pressure pump sprayer. Begin by spraying a 5-foot wide section of the siding, from the ground to the top. Remember not to angle the sprayer upward to keep the solution from seeping under the siding layers. Instead, aim the sprayer in such a way that the solution is sprayed from above. Using a ladder may help you achieve a more even application.
 Pour whatever solution remains in the sprayer back in the bucket. Rinse the sprayer and refill it with clean water. Rinse the solution off of the vinyl, starting from the top so the water will run downward.
 Do steps 4 to 6 on the next 5-foot portion of your siding. Continue doing this until you have cleaned the entire wall.

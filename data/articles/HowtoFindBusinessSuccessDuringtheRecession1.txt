 Businesses that remain competitive during a recession offer less-expensive alternatives for goods and services. During a recession, customers are looking for ways to stretch their dollars. If you can offer your product or service for a lower price than your competitors, customers are likely to continue giving you their business. Later, when the recession is over, you can expand your business because of your strong customer base., Identify a market need and make plans to satisfy that need. Even during a recession, the market has room for new business ideas. Especially if the service or product offered meets a real need in the market.For example, during the most recent recession, a pawn shop owner observed that people were having a hard time getting credit. He created a service that allowed people to post items in an online pawn shop and receive short-term, collateral-based loans.
 Start a service or offer a product that allows customers to meet their needs more efficiently. In addition to offering a lower price point, create services or products that let customers get results more quickly. People are always willing to pay for value.For example, one company started offering outsourced accounting services. Other businesses that were struggling were able to let their in-house accounting employees go and use the outsourced accounting services, saving them significant money.

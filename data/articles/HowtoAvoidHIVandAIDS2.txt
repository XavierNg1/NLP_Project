 You are less likely to become exposed to HIV if you do not have sex, reduce the number of your sexual partners, require sexual partners to get tested for HIV, and/or limit your sex to uninfected sexual partners who do not have sex outside your relationship. Choosing one or more of these sexual practices is an excellent way to reduce the chance of HIV transmission, especially when combined with condom use as described below.


Have long-term sexual partners get tested for HIV before you have sex without a condom. A significant percentage of people with HIV do not know they have the virus., HIV can be transmitted through oral, vaginal, or anal sex if one or more people involved are HIV+. However, there are ways to reduce, but not eliminate, the chance of its transmission. Always use latex condoms or latex female condoms when having sex with a new sexual partner, any sexual partner who has not been recently tested for HIV, or during every sexual encounter if you have multiple sexual partners. When performing oral sex on a vagina or anus, use dental dams or non-lubricated, cut-open condoms for oral sex to prevent direct contact with the mouth.



Warning: lambskin condoms do not prevent infection, as they contain microscopic holes that the virus can travel through. Polyurethane condoms may not prevent infection as effectively as latex condoms., Practice putting on and removing a condom or a female condom several times before you use one during sex for the first time. Talk to your sexual partner in advance about condom use so you aren't pressured not to use one at the last minute, and make sure to put on the condom before any genital contact begins.Male condoms should be pinched at the tip before putting them on, so there is room for the semen to collect. Make sure not to expose yourself to the portion of the condom that was exposed to your sexual partner's fluids while removing the condom, especially if you have cuts on your hands. Follow these instructions as well for safest condom use:A condom or dental dam should never be torn, used past its expiration date, re-used, or used for more than 20 minutes at a time.
Apply a small amount of water-based lube to the condom if necessary to prevent it from drying out and breaking. Never use oil-based lubes or lotions, which can damage the condom.
Penises with condoms should be pulled out from orifices before the erection is lost, as the condom may slip off when the penis is no longer hard.
Store condoms inside their wrapper in a dark, dry location. Replace condoms that have been kept in your wallet or car for longer than one or two weeks.
 There are many myths or misunderstandings about how to protect yourself from HIV or AIDS during sex. Learn the truth so you do not try to protect yourself with the wrong method. Understand that any form of sex with an HIV positive person carries the risk of infection, and that condoms are one of the most reliable ways to reduce that risk.


You cannot prevent infection using any type of birth control besides condoms.
You cannot eliminate the chance of infection through circumcision. Studies show that circumcision partially reduces a man's chance of contracting HIV from an HIV+ woman.However, this is not effective enough on its own to result in "safe sex," and does not necessarily help at all in male-male sexual encounters, or reduce the chance of a woman contracting HIV from a man.
There is no such thing as a special lube, anti-microbe medicine, or vaccination that protects against HIV.Lube is only useful in HIV prevention because it helps prevent condoms from breaking, not because it can stop the virus on its own.
 While no sexual activity that involves the vagina, penis, or anus is completely safe, some involve lower risks than other and may be preferable if you have decided to have sex with someone you know is HIV positive. Oral sex, especially mouth-on-vagina, carries less risk than other forms of sex, although studies are unclear on the exact level of risk.Inserting fingers or sex toys into the anus or vagina carries little risk of transmission as long as the fingers do not have open cuts or sores, and the sex toys are washed between uses.

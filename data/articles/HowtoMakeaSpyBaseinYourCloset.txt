 If your closet is very small (example: it only has room to hold your clothes and some shoes, and that's it) this may not be the best idea because you will be very cramped and you want to be comfortable, remember? Walk-ins are perfect for organizations with lots of people.;
, Don't get a box and label it "Spy Files" and put it somewhere obvious (this IS a secret, remember?), instead, try to obtain a shoebox that is fairly large (can fit a 8 1/2 by 11" piece of paper inside without bending it) and put some shoes on top of your files. Or, get a folder and label it "Math" or another school subject. And, if you keep a notebook like Harriet from Harriet the Spy, the shoebox trick will work too. See the article Hide Your Diary for more ideas.
 Put a blanket down on the floor, add some pillows in the corners, bring in things like portable DVD players and lamps for light if you don't have one. If you have an electric plug near or in your closet, you can plug in things that aren't battery-operated or chargers. Some things you can put in your spy base are your iPod dock, laptop, DVD player, and iPod.
 This is useful if another member calls you with information, so you don't have to get up out of your spy base to answer a call. Cell phones are easier to use, because if you get a call, no one can pick up the other phone, turn it on, and listen in. It helps to have your own phone in your room.
 You don't want anyone to discover your base, do you? So, create a system to disguise it. There's always the option of taking your base apart entirely, but it would be a pain to put back together after. An example is to roll up the blanket and put it in a corner, stack the pillows up by the blanket, and unplug any electronics and put them in a box marked "Storage". That way, if anyone looks in your closet, they will just think you are storing things in there.
 Once you are done, go inside your base and relax!,

 To ensure a quick cleanup, empty the cooker of all food once it is done cooking. Before you sit down to enjoy your hot meal, fill the cooker up with enough water to cover any remaining food that clings to the inside. Turn the heat to low while you eat.This will prevent the traces of food inside from drying into a crust.
 For easy-to-clean messes, pour a squirt of dish soap into the bottom of the cooker. Add enough hot water to line the bottom and create suds. Then use a sponge to scrub the interior clean. Rinse and dry immediately with cloth or paper towels.Be careful with rinsing. Use your sinkâ€™s spray nozzle or pour water along the inside only. Then carefully pour the dirty water into the sink.
Water on the outside of the cleaner could effect electrical components., For tougher messes, make a paste with baking soda and hydrogen peroxide, since the baking soda will be more abrasive on any stubborn gunk. Shake about a quarter cup (two ounces) of baking soda into the bottom of the cooker. Add hydrogen peroxide until there is enough liquid to stir them into a thick paste.Then scrub the insides with the paste and a sponge.If needed, add more soda and peroxide to create more paste on your first try, or repeat as needed.

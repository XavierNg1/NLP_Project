 If you have natural lowbush blueberries growing in the local woods, you may be able to use these directly. It is possible to take rhizomes from existing blueberry clones and grow them in pots. These can then be planted in your yard for native landscaping and berries. If they are grown in their native environment, there will be no need to amend for pH; check your soil, as the pH should range between 4.5 and 6.0.;
, Blueberries are highly variable plants. You may even find huckleberry. This is the time to select for:
size






berry color






fall leaf color






flavor; and






species.
, Taking pieces between 6 and 12 inches in length. Some of the pieces may have above ground stems which can be left attached. Select from several clones, this aids in pollination and fruit set.
 Fill the bottom half with sand and the top with peat. Plant the rhizome in the peat just above the sand.
 Keep pots moist but not waterlogged.
 After a few weeks some of the plants with above ground parts will break bud. At this time move them to a sunny location until ready for out-planting. Fertilize sparingly with a soluble fertilizer designed for acidic plants, available at most garden centers. Keep pots moist.
 Try to get as much sun as possible if fruit is desired. Also avoid close proximity to concrete walks and foundations (high pH). Simply dig a shallow hole and set the rootball in and backfill. Because these are rhizomatous plants, planting depth is not super critical but deeper is probably better than shallow. Cover with a shallow mulch (bark). Weeding is important as blueberries do not tolerate heavy competition.
 This forces the plants to put their energy into vegetative growth. The first few sets of fruit aren't much anyway; doing this will pay good dividends in the fruit set approximately 3-4 years later.

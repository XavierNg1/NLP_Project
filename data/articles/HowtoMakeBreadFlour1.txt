 For this recipe, you'll need only two ingredients: all-purpose flour and vital wheat gluten. All-purpose flour can be purchased at nearly any grocery store. However, you may need to make a trip to a health food store or a baking supply store to find vital wheat gluten.Alternatively, if you can stand to wait, vital wheat gluten is easily available for order online. Either way, it is not especially expensive â€” a small bag should cost less than $10.You won't need more than a few teaspoons of vital wheat gluten for most bread recipes.;
, Look at the recipe to see how much bread flour is required. Measure out this much all-purpose flour instead. Pour this flour into a mixing bowl separate from the other ingredients.
 This converts all-purpose flour to a form that can be used just like bread flour. This ratio scales proportionally.


For instance, if your recipe calls for 2 1/2 cups of bread flour, you would add 2 1/2 teaspoons vital wheat gluten to 2 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour.
 This step isn't essential, but a little wheat flour works well as a binding agent and gives the bread a subtle "nutty" flavor. Add no more than 1/2 teaspoon per cup of all-purpose flour so as not to affect the total volume of your dry ingredients., Sift the ingredients above together in the bowl. Once they are well incorporated, you will be left with a substance you can use in place of bread flour.


The gluten in the new flour substitute will give the final product a denser, "stronger" bread than you would have otherwise. Don't be alarmed if your bread turns out with a slightly different texture than it had before.

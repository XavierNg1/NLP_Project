 Use a permanent marker or a pen to write the mailing and return address. Also, write the addresses clearly in all capital letters and in English. Do not use periods or commas, and do not use more than five lines. The address should be centered on the envelope and contain the recipient’s name, street address or .P.O box number, the city (or town), the state (alternatively province or county), postal code, and country. It should look like this:KAREN BROWN
5043 MOLINA STREET
HOUSTON TEXAS 77008
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

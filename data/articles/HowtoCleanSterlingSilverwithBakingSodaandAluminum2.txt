 Make sure none of the silver pieces are touching. Set them in the pan. Make sure each piece makes contact with the foil.
 Set a timer. Allow the pieces to sit for about 30 seconds before removing them.








After the pieces are done soaking, use tongs to remove them. You should set them down on an absorbent surface, such as a paper towel.
 Dry the pieces using a rag or paper towels. After they are dry, take a soft cloth. Gently buff the pieces using this cloth. Keep buffing until you've removed any dirt, debris, or tarnish and the pieces are shiny.
 Very dirty or tarnished sterling silver may not be completely clean after the first wash. If your silver is still dull and dirty, repeat the process once more.

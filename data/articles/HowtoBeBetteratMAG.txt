 This is almost mandatory. A mic is very important. It lets you tell your team what's happening around and you can give orders to your squad, platoon or company.;
, Working with your team is vital to winning the match(even in suppression) because instead of failing 100 times in a row from charging the objective by yourself, group up with your team and take it together. Example: you could get some people lobbing frags and guys with shotguns storming it, while a couple of medics are right behind and one or two snipers are covering them.
 If you're a platoon or company leader, tell the squad or platoon leaders what to do and then they will tell their squad what to do and they'll do it. Strategies work a lot better than just charging whatever and whoever is the closest. Examples: (platoon leader) alpha and bravo squads, you guys go around the left flank and charlie and delta, the right. (company leader) Everyone go to A and make your way down the letters.
 Don't snipe around randomly because the only thing that will happen is that you will get kills and you will probably lose the match. Example: Sometimes you can see the objective from where your sniping and shoot anyone trying to take it.
 Don't be a leader just for the prestige. Actually make some decisions that will help your team to win the match.
 This will help you and your teammates because: you get points by reviving them and they don't have to respawn all the way back at the spawn point.

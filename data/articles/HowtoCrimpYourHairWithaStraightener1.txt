 Even if you have curly hair, it might be a good idea to straighten it. This will help reduce frizz later on.;
, Try to get something light weight or that enhances curls., Gather all of your hair above ear level into a loose bun. Leave the lower layer of your hair hanging down by your shoulders. You will be working with this layer first.
 The more, smaller sections you make, the tighter crimp you will get. For a very tight crimp, try Â½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) wide sections.
 The smaller, tighter braids, the better. If you want more volume, start braiding right at the roots. If you want less volume, start braiding only halfway down the hair shaft. Tie each braid off with a small hair elastic.
 Be sure to get the front and back of each braid. You will also want to spray the ends of your hair as well. This will protect your hair from the heat of the hair straightener. It will keep your hair from getting too dry or scorched.
 Start close to your roots, and press down on the braid for a few seconds with your straightener. Release the braid, and press the next segment flat. You may need to run the straightener through your braids twice.
 You will work with the upper layer first. This will give the braids enough time to cool down. If you take the braids out too soon, they will lose their crimp.
 Divide this hair into at least six, equal sections. Try to use the same amount of sections as your used in your lower layer.
 Be sure to spray your hair liberally with a heat protection spray before you straighten it.
 Do not take the braids out if your hair is still warm. If you do, the crimp will fall out. Once your hair is cool, start undoing the braids from the bottom layer first.
 If you do, your hair will turn frizzy. If the crimp is too tight, you can loosen it by gently running your fingers through your hair.
 This will help the crimp last longer.

 The sweet vanilla and dairy flavors in a frappuccino can overpower the coffee unless you use coffee that is quite strong. There are a few different ways to do this. See below:


One way is to simply brew a pot of extra-strong coffee. Brew a pot normally, then pour the coffee into the water tank and run it through the machine again using the same grounds. After, run a cycle of water (without any grounds) to clean the machine. See our article on using a coffee maker for help.
You can also make espresso, but you'll need an espresso machine for this. See our article on using one.
Finally, you can try buying liquid coffee concentrate at your local specialty grocery store.;
, Pour the coffee/espresso, milk, condensed milk, and vanilla into a good-quality blender. Make sure this is a blender that can handle ice.
 Add a generous amount of ice, filling the blender at least 3/4 of the way to the top (if you wish, you can go up to the rim). You'll be surprised how much ice you need. Once it's crushed, it does not take up very much space.


Adding more ice will give you a slushier, more solid drink. Adding less ice will give you something a little more liquid (like a milkshake). If you're in doubt, you can always err on the "less" side and add more if it's not thick enough.
 You want to blend the ice completely into tiny pieces. No solid chunks should remain. Depending on your blender, this can take anywhere from 10-30 seconds. When you're finished, you should have a uniformly smooth, icy, tan mixture.


You may want to use a utensil or stirring stick to feel for chunks in the blended mixture once you finish. Pulse the blender a few more times if you find any.
 Transfer to a cup. For the complete Starbucks experience, top with whipped cream and drink through a green straw.

 The Khajit are a natural choice for a Nightblade as they have a race-based bonus to their stealth radius. However, their other race bonuses make them better as a more combat-based Nightblade (they also have bonuses to medium armor and melee attacks). Lean towards a dual wield, instead of a bow, to take advantage of the bonus. Khajit are available to those in the Aldmeri Dominion. , Bosmer are another natural choice for a Nightblade. They have a bonus to stealth as well, plus a bonus to bow use. Accordingly lean towards a bow if playing with this race. Bosmer are available to those in the Aldmeri Dominion.
 Argonians have natural healing abilities, which can seriously come in handy since Nightblades will have to put many of their points into magicka and stamina, rather than health. Their natural weapon bonus is for a Restoration Staff (not the most useful weapon for a Nightblade) so you can choose any weapon you want (bows and dual-wield are best for Nightblades). Argonians are not the best Nightblades but they are the most qualified race available to those in the Ebonheart Pact.
 Bretons are great at protecting themselves and have a hefty magicka pool from which to draw (magicka is used when executing class-based abilities). Since their emphasis is on magicka, you will need to choose abilities which help them attack effectively, since their abilities to use weapons may be decreased. Bretons are not the best Nightblades but they are the most qualified race available to those in the Daggerfall Covenant.

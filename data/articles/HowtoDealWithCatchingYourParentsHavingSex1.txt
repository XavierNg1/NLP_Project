 In this scenario, you are the intruder. Whether you came home too early, or you didn't knock, knocked and walked right in- you are the one "disturbing."


Stay calm and take a deep breath. Figure out your exit strategy- how far is the door, and how silent can you get to it?
Make a quiet exit. If they haven't noticed you, because they are so-ahem- engaged in action, get out as quiet and as fast as you can.
Never, ever mention what you saw or did, and move on with your life.;
, If they've noticed you, the imperative is still to remove yourself physically from the situation as soon as possible.


Say "I am sorry" and be out of there.
Act normal the next time you see your parents- and block any attempt of theirs to talk about what you've seen with a friendly "It's none of my business" or "That was your private time."
Don't ever bring up the incident- they'll be grateful.
 This depends on the relationship you have with your parents and might not work for everybody.


Smile, and say "Hey, at least it's not the plumber, Mom" or something along these lines.
Be prepared to have something thrown at you, and leave the room.
Don't mention the incident ever again.
 This is also only an option if for whatever reason you cannot immediately remove yourself from the situation.


Tell them you were looking for socks, wanted to ask them for cash etc.
Do not show any emotions or feelings.
Take whatever reaction you get- they may just shout "out"- you leave.
Keep quiet about the incident and focus on your own life. There are plenty of other things to worry about that your parents' sexuality.

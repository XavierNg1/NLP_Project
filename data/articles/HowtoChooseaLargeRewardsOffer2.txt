 This will give you an idea of your total reward. For example, you may estimate that you'll spend $15,000 with the card in a year's time.
 Multiply your estimated card use by .01. $15,000 X .01 is $150. You would be rewarded $150 for charging $15,000 on the card.
 The $200 sign-up bonus, plus the $150 end-of-year reward, minus the $80 annual fee leaves you with a total reward of $270 for using the card that year. That's not bad, assuming you buy only things you would have bought even without the card. If you make purchases just because you'll be rewarded by the card company, you may wind up poorer, not richer.

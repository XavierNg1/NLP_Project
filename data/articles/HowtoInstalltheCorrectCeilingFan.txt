 Ceiling fans with light fixtures permit you to add additional lighting to your room. The fan will work with air conditioning or with open windows to cool your home. During winter a ceiling fan operating in reverse helps to circulate the warmer air that collects at the ceiling.;
, It is important to buy the right size fan for the intended room, consider the following guidelines for the right size fan:


If the room dimension is 12 feet (3.7 m) or less, you need a 36-inch fan
If the room dimension is 12 to 16 feet (3.7 to 4.9 m), you need a 48-inch fan
If the room dimension is 16 to 18 feet (4.9 to 5.5 m), you need a 52-inch fan

, The fan hardware is usually included with the fan.
 Before starting, turn off the power at the main circuit breaker panel. If you are not sure which breaker to use, then turn off the master breaker to the entire house.
, Test the fixture box to ensure it will hold the weight of the fan. If for some reason it does not hold, a metal brace will be needed to be installed between the joists. In most cases, the canopy of the fan will cover any holes that are drilled into the ceiling.
 Run the wire into the mounting box of the fixture. Make sure the face of the box is flush with the ceiling.
 The bars holding the mounting box are then twisted to extend the braces.
 Attach the black wires together, attach the white wires together, and attach the bare wire to the green wire (ground). Secure the fan to the fan box using the mounting bolts and install the canopy to cover the ceiling holes and fixture box. Install the fan blade if not installed.
 Enjoy your new fan.

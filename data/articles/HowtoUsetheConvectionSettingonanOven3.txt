 As your dish cooks to completion, you should check it relatively often. This is especially important if you’re not that familiar with the convection setting, as dishes may cook faster than on a regular setting.


Check your food about halfway through.
Start to check your dish more often about two thirds to three quarters of the way to the end.
Trust your sight and smell more than the timer., By putting too many dishes in your convection oven, you’ll slow down the ability of the fan to move air around the oven. This will essentially make the convection option ineffective – and you may spoil your dish., Because the fan in your convection oven will be moving the air around, you’ll need to secure parchment or aluminum foil that you use to line a baking sheet or cover a dish with. To do this, either bend the aluminum foil down around the cookie sheet, or place a metal spoon or something similar on top of the foil or parchment paper., Ultimately, the convection setting is just one feature on your oven. You should experiment to see what settings help you to make the best food you can make. Consider cooking the same dish with and without the convection setting on, then, offer them to your friends and family and ask which one was better.

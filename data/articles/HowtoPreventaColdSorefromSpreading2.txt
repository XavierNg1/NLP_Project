Washing your hands frequently will help keep the virus from spreading to other people., If you have a cold sore, you should not share with other people things like eating utensils, razors, towels, drinks, toothbrushes, lip balms, and other items that may come in contact with the cold sore or saliva. This includes secondary contact, as when your hand touches the cold sore and then the item., The herpes virus can pass from your cold sore to another person through kissing, so to be safe you should refrain from kissing someone while you have a visible cold sore., Engaging in oral sex while you have a cold sore can spread the herpes virus that causes cold sores (HSV-1) to the genitals.Oral sex can also cause the herpes virus that causes genital herpes (HSV-2) to spread from an infected person to the lips., Since the herpes virus is most contagious when cold sores appear, if you can make them go away, then you reduce the chances of spreading the virus to another person.


Ask your doctor about what antiviral drugs (such as Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, Famciclovir, and Penciclovir) you can take to make the cold sores disappear sooner.
Some antivirals are in pill form, while others are creams. For severe cases there are also injections.
You can also take an over-the-counter cream (containing Docosanol) to shorten your cold sore outbreak.If you use an antiviral cream, apply it to the cold sore while wearing a disposable glove and/or use a cotton swab. This will keep you from touching the cold sore and potentially spreading the virus.

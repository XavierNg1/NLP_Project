 Be sure you have accounted for as much of the business as you reasonably can. Have you accounted for every asset and every dollar that enters or leaves the company, including those that might not be on the financial record? If you're the buyer, have you accounted for loan costs?


Think methodically. List expenses and incomes by type and then go down the list and ask yourself, “does this business have this factor?” If the answer is yes, make sure you have a figure for it.
Think outside the money. Account for “soft” factors like the location, age, and general reputation of the business. These can drastically alter its cash flow value.
 Compare the market range for similar businesses to the income and asset figures you calculated. Be sure that your income figure multiplies up to the range consistently, and that your asset figure matches up with the assets of businesses in the range.
 The specifics of how the business is being sold will affect the figures you've come up with, whether you're a buyer or a seller. Various things can raise or lower the amount of money that can reasonably be expected to change hands during a business sale.


Know the difference between cash and credit. A seller demanding a cash sale will command a lower final figure than one willing to work with financing. Likewise, a buyer who offers cash can probably negotiate a lower price.

Buyers should also be aware of how they're balancing monthly payments with the down payment. By placing a larger amount of money down at the beginning of a financing deal, a buyer can make his or her monthly payments smaller, which will result in more monthly income from the business.

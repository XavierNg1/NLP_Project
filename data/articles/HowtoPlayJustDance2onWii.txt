 This may seem silly to do for just a video game, but you'd be surprised by how tiring it gets, and before certain songs you should certainly stretch your arms and your legs, and maybe your wrists, fingers, and neck, too. You don't have to, but it's a great idea to do so.;
, Anything that is comfortable will work fine, like gym shorts and a tank top, or a T-shirt. For girls with long hair, I suggest that you tie back your hair, but it's not required. As long as you aren't wearing anything tight or really long (or layered), you'll be good.
 Pick a song you like, or one that looks cool. There are many songs to choose from. If you are playing with more than one person, press A on a remote to add you. You'll start to play. All you have to do is copy the person dancing. It's not difficult at all. Many times the moves are simple hand motions, or spinning, or something like that. Also, the moves repeat themselves many times. To know when to change moves, a small person will appear at the bottom of the screen showing you the next move. Note: Foot motions are not required, because the Wii Remote can only sense your hand. However, it's still fun to do!

, The goal is to get the most points. At each move, you can get an "X", an "OK", a "Good", or a "Perfect". An X means you didn't really get the move. OK means you're not quite there, but you tried. Good means almost there! And perfect means you did an awesome job on the move. Some moves are called gold moves. Every song has at least one, and many songs have several gold moves. A gold move is a special dance move, and it may or may not be harder than a regular move. If you execute the gold move well, you'll get a "YEAH!". If you don't, you'll get an "X".

Many songs are duets.

Although individual scores are the basis of the overall team scores, the extreme multiplayer basis of the mode changes what can be the individual nature of dance into something very different.

 Give the person a bit of gauze and tell them to hold the gauze over the tooth.


Gently wiggle the tooth back and forth, from side to side. The key word here is "gentle," but you also need to increase the movements a little bit as you wiggle the tooth.
If lots of blood comes out, consider stopping the procedure. Lots of blood is usually a sign that the tooth isn't yet ready to come out.
Firmly but slowly lift the tooth up until the ligaments connecting the tooth to the gum are severed. If too much pain or blood exists, consider stopping the procedure.
 Biting down on an apple can be a good way to pull a tooth, especially for children. Biting down on an apple is more effective for teeth in the front than it is for teeth in the back.
 If the tooth is really loose and the apple method does not work, make a knot around the tooth using a 30 centimeter (11.8Â in) long piece of dental floss. Then, pull on the floss quickly to remove the tooth with one stroke.

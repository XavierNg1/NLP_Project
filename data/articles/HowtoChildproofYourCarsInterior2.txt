 With your car's childproof locks enabled, you can prevent your child from opening the car door while in transit. If your car does not have automatic childproof locks, place your child in the middle of the back seat where they cannot reach the door locks.


Refer to your car's manual to learn of the steps for enabling your car's automatic, childproof locks, or contact your car's manufacturer for more information on having these types of locks installed.
 This will prevent your child from handling or playing with objects that can present a choking or health hazard, and can reduce injuries caused by loose items being thrown around the car's interior during an accident.


Remove small toys your child can put in their mouth, and poisonous liquids such as car cleaner or windshield wiper fluid from the back seat and from underneath the front seats.
 If your child is occupied with toys, books, or music while you drive, they may not become bored or inspired to play with door locks, and other parts of your car's interior.


Bring toys that are soft to the touch, such as cloth books, stuffed animals, or dolls. In the event an accident occurs, soft toys are less likely to cause injury upon impact.
 This will prevent your child from crawling into the trunk from the back seat at any time while the car is moving or idle.
 And always keep keys and remote openers out of reach of children.
 Keep your hand bag or cell phone in the back to help make it a habit to always check the back seat every time you park!

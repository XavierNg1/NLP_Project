 With lower temperatures, bass will not expend much effort and will only bite when your lure is immediately within their strike zone.;
, Pre-spawn means that bass will be around the 8–15 feet (2.4–4.6 m) depth, spawn means they will move up to their spawning beds, post-spawn means they will move back down to 8-15 feet, and the late spring has bass moving towards the shore early in the morning and out towards structures later.


Pre-spawn occurs when waters climb to around the 45 degree mark. Spawn occurs when water is between 55 and 65 degrees. Post spawn occurs at different times and doesn't happen to an entire lake due to differences in water temperatures. Late Spring is basically the beginning of summer when temperatures climb upwards of 80 and 90 degrees.
 When fishing in the Summer, bass will be closer to the shore early in the morning to feed then move into open water around creek channels and structures.


They will school together and feed on shad near the top of the water so it's best to use topwater, plastics, jigs, and even lipless crankbaits.
 As the temperature drops in the Fall, bass will be feeding closer to shore but will show more erratic behavior. The first cool night of Fall is a good time to look for a feeding frenzy as bass prepare for the upcoming cold months., Depending on the weather and which phase of their mating cycle they are in, bass may like to stay close to certain areas or hide within debris. Vegetation, rocky bottoms, shallow flats, fallen trees, structures, bushes and grass can all provide ample places to cast. Research the swimming habits that may correspond to the time and place that you are fishing.

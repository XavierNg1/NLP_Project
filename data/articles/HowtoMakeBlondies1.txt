, Cover the sides of the baking pan with a thin layer of butter then sprinkle a dusting of flour around the pan.This prevents the blondies from sticking to the pan.


You can also use baking spray as a healthier option.
 You can melt the butter in either a sauce pot or in a glass dish in the microwave. Just heat the butter enough that it is completely melted -- it doesn't need to be hot.


if using the microwave, heat the butter in 30 second intervals.
 While the butter is still melted, pour it into the sugar and quickly combine them. Let this mixture cool while you move on to the flour.
 These make up your dry ingredients.
 These form your wet ingredients. Make sure they are well mixed, but don't worry if some of the liquid is separated from the sugar.


Do not whisk in the eggs until the sugar is cool to the touch, otherwise you risk cooking your eggs.
 Combine the two bowls and, using a spatula, mix them together until you have a consistent batter. If you want any add-ins, like chocolate chips or nuts, add them now.


Once there are no more chunks of flour or sugar the mixture is ready.
 Even it out with your spatula so that the top is flat.
 The bars will be golden brown on the tops and edges when they are finished. Stick a fork or wooden skewer through the center of the blondies and pull it out quickly. If there is wet batter on the knife then the blondies still need to cook.


You may need to cook them for an extra 2-3 minutes depending on your oven's strength.

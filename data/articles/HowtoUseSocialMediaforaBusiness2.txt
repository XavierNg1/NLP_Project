 This account should be separate from personal accounts, and should be solely dedicated to your business. You should have a separate account for each social media platform you have a presence on (i.e., you should not use a Google or Facebook account to log into everything).



Facebook. Facebook is by the far the best platform for promoting brand awareness, as nearly 75% of Americans adults use the site. Facebook is a great platform for promoting virtually any brand, due to its very heterogeneous user base.

Instagram. Instagram is a great option for brands that rely heavily on images, such as clothing companies and retailers. It’s also particularly effective for reaching young adults (from teens to late twenties), Hispanics and African Americans.

Google+. While Google+ hasn’t expanded as well and as quickly as many people predicted, it can be a great platform to reach males in the technology industry, as two-thirds of the network’s users are men, the majority of which are engineers or work in other technological jobs.

Pinterest. Pinterest is a first-rate social platform to reach females, especially for brands marketing jewelry or apparel.
 When choosing your profile picture, your logo is usually the best pick. The bio should be extremely similar, if not the same for all accounts, and should include links to other social media platforms.
 On Instagram, if you integrate your accounts, you’ll easily be able to share content simultaneously on multiple social networks. Your followers from other social media platforms will see you are on that platform and follow you there.

 By doing this, you can easily see where certain rooms need to go.;
, Of course, this isn't necessary, but it brings these important rooms close together, which allows the walking distance for your creatures to be minimized. By building them close to your heart, and not building out to far initially, you prevent yourself from stumbling upon large areas of lava or water, which the enemy can easily cross using bridges and attack you.
 This allows creatures like Bile Demons and Demon Spawn to fill up your ranks. Once these creatures have created their houses in the Lair, send them immediately to the training room to whip them into shape and to increase their power.
 But it is important to note that you should always leave space for the primary rooms to expand.
 To do this, simply drop an imp next to an unfortified wall and they will do the task.
 Creatures like Warlocks, whose speciality it is to study in the library for spells, should be allowed to research. But a good choice would be to send at least two of them to train. This should be done to all creatures who have jobs like manufacturing (Trolls), researching (Dragons and Warlocks), or even doing nothing except sleeping (Beetles).

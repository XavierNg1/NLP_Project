Run quickly to a house or building nearby. Be careful, though; you can't run far before the bees catch up to you!
Press Y or click the button in the upper right touch screen. Equip your net. Watch their flying pattern. There will most likely be a time when the bees go behind you. Press B or the upper right button right before they reach this position. Rapidly start tapping A or the direction of the touch screen.

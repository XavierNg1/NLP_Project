, Stir this well and then put to one side. The mixture will now curdle and this is what should be happening.
 If you want chocolate cupcakes, add cocoa (about 1/2 cup) to this stage.
 Mix together.
, Usually fill each paper cupcake holder with about 1/4 cup of batter. If you prefer larger cupcakes, then add a half a cup but make sure the muffin pan is larger and the cupcake holders are bigger.
 If you can smell the cupcakes earlier, check to make sure they aren't browning earlier (this means they're more than ready). If you aren't certain, turn off the oven earlier and let them sit for a few more minutes rather than bake them into rocks.
 Place cupcakes onto a wire rack to cool.
 The flavor of icing or frosting can be improved by adding a little of your favorite juice to it instead of soy milk or water.

Alt code sites have lists of symbols with their corresponding Alt codes. Just scroll through the list until you find a symbol you want to use.
 Do this by left-clicking the symbol and dragging your mouse over it.
 Hit Ctrl + C for windows or CMD + C for Mac.
 Go to the text field where you want to insert the symbol into then press CTRL + V (for windows) or CMD + V (for Mac).


You can also copy and paste colored symbols like those unique to Facebook.

 Select a cell and type an equals (=) sign, then alternate between clicking on the first number you need to add, then typing the plus (+) sign, then clicking on the second number you want to add, and so on. Each time you click on another number, Excel will insert the cell reference for you (C4, for example), which tells Excel which spreadsheet cell contains the number (for C4, it's the cell in column C, in row 4). Your finished formula should look something like this: =C4+C5+C6+C7.


If you know which cells you want to calculate, you can type them out at once instead of selecting them individually.
Excel functions will recognize mixed numbers and cell entries. That is, you could add 5000+C5+25.2+B7.
 Excel will automatically add the numbers together for you.

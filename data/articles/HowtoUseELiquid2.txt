 Shake it first because the "vegetable glycerin", which is one of the main ingredients in E-liquid, is heavy and can settle at the bottom of the bottle.
 Aim the tip of the bottle of e-liquid toward the wall of the e-cigâ€™s tank. Be careful to not get any of the e-liquid onto your skin.


Proceed to add approximately 20 drops to a brand new cartomizer or atomizer.
 The liquid should be hitting the wall only.Do not try to fill the e-cig tank while it is still connected to the battery; make sure that it is fully disconnected.
New tips will require more e-liquid because they are dry and need to be saturated, this will take at least a full minute.
 Doing so once the liquid has been added ensures that the liquid can saturate the internal fibers.


When the tank of the e-cigarette is full, screw its mouthpiece back on.
From there, screw the tank onto the battery. Make sure that all components are screwed together tightly.

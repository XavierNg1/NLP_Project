 Getting a cyst drained requires local or general anesthesia, depending on the severity of the cyst. Before draining your cyst, your doctor will administer a local or general anesthesia to prevent you from feeling any pain from the procedure. For a small skin cyst, only a local anesthesia may be necessary, and these procedures can often be performed in the doctor's office. If the cyst is deep or large, then general anesthesia may be necessary. This may require a hospital visit, but is usually a day surgery., After the area has been anesthetized, your doctor will make an incision in the cyst using a sterile surgical knife. The incision will allow your doctor to drain the contents of the cyst and remove the cyst wall if necessary. Removing the cyst wall may help prevent the cyst from returning., In some cases, it may be necessary to place a drainage tube in order to allow a cyst to continue to drain for a few days. Your doctor will secure the tube using stitches and the opening will be less than a ¼ inch (6 mm) in diameter. This process is called “marsupialization.”, After the cyst has been fully drained and the cyst wall has been removed, your doctor will suture the area where the incision was made. You may need to wear a bandage over this area as well. Make sure that you follow your doctor’s instructions for caring for the surgical wound. Call your doctor if you notice any signs of infection including:Redness, particularly red streaks emanating from the wound site
Warmth
Swelling
Pus
Intense throbbing at the wound site
Fever of 100.4 °F (38°C) or more, Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic as part of the follow-up treatment for an infected cyst or if your cyst was related to a sexually transmitted infection.If your doctor prescribes an antibiotic, then it is important to use it exactly as directed. Make sure that you take the full prescription or you may be at a higher risk of infection, re-infection, or complications later on.

 Rather than limiting yourself to the off-the-shelf colour choices, why not mix your own colour? Even if it's just adding white or black to one of their existing colours, a few simple tweaks can produce something unlike anything else in their colour repertoire - and unlike anything in anyone else's living room.;
, This could be a lighter or darker version of what you actually want, or a version with more or less of a certain colour mixed into it than you'd want.
 Ask if they'll either mix a new colour based on that colour, or if they'll alter an off-the-shelf tin of paint from the likes of Dulux, Crown and so on. They can be wary of doing this, so you might have to identify a colour and go elsewhere to get a new colour made up for you.
 Once they've mixed up a tin - go home and paint a small swatch of the colour on your wall to make sure that it is the colour you want.
 If you like it, arrange to get more of it made so you go ahead and paint your walls in a colour you're not going to see in a neighbour's front room any time soon!

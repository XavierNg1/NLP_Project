 Every vector can be numerically represented in the Cartesian coordinate system with a horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) component.It is written as an ordered pair v=<x,y>{\displaystyle v=<x,y>}.

 For example, the vector above has a horizontal component of 3 and a vertical component of -5, therefore the ordered pair is <3, -5>.
;
, When you draw the horizontal and vertical components, you end up with a right triangle. The magnitude of the vector is equal to the hypotenuse of the triangle so you can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate it.
 The Pythagorean theorem is A2 + B2 = C2. “A” and “B” are the horizontal and vertical components of the triangle while “C” is the hypotenuse. Since the vector is the hypotenuse you want to solve for “C”.

 x2 + y2 = v2

 v = √(x2 + y2))


, Using the equation above, you can plug in the numbers of the ordered pair of the vector to solve for the magnitude.

 For example, v = √((32+(-5)2))

 v =√(9 + 25) = √34 = 5.831

Don't worry if your answer is not a whole number. Vector magnitudes can be decimals.

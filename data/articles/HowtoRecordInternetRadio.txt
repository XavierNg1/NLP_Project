 Nearly all major radio stations will allow live listening on their website. Many smaller radio stations (such as college stations) will also broadcast their channel on their website.;
, A podcast disseminates broadcasts in an episodic format; however, podcasts are not streamed live. Once the podcast episode is released, you can simply download it using the appropriate software (Apple's iTunes has built-in support for downloading podcasts).
 There are many programs available for download that have this capability. Compare software in terms of functionality and cost to determine which one is appropriate for your needs.


An important thing to consider is whether the program supports automatic disambiguation - meaning it will automatically split the recording into separate files for each song. If this feature is not included, you will end up with a single large audio file for the entire recording.
Some popular software available includes RipCast, Freecorder, Replay A/V, and StationRipper. Some of these programs will offer a free trial version that allows limited functionality.
 This process will differ based on the software you use. Some applications actually have a browser that allows you to find and mark your favorite programs for later recording, much like a DVR on a television set. Other programs will simply have a "Record" button that you press after you have manually started streaming the broadcast.
 Using the software's menus, save the recording on your hard drive. At this point, you will choose the format for saving the audio file (mp3 is a common and highly supported format, for example).
 Once you have saved the files, you can play them using any media player software by double-clicking on them. You can also burn them to CDs using the appropriate software.

 Do not seek out the other person for conversations or discussions. If you work with the other person, keep interaction limited and to a public area. Remain friendly and civil at all times, assuming behavior you’d exhibit with your child’s school principal or another professional.
 If you have to correspond with the other person, keep it professional and concise. Don’t add jokes or personal information during your interaction. If you're not required to email or call the flirtatious person, avoid contact.
 Never encourage the behavior after you’ve had a discussion or stopped interacting with the flirtatious person; this will send a mixed message and could rekindle the behavior. Keep any meeting limited to group situations and maintain limited to no contact with the specific person.

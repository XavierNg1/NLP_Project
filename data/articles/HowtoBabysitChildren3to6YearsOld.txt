 Find out all you need to know about the child before starting the role. For example, find out what health issues the child might have, such as allergies, asthma, epilepsy, anger management issues, etc. Also find out all the things the child likes and ways that the parents use to distract the child. Write down the important information. Other things to find out include:


Expected bedtime
Bedtime story favorites
Snacks allowed; meals required (including dietary preferences)
Food likes and dislikes
Diaper needs or toileting issues
Fears the child might have
Visitor policy
Faith observance
Always be prepared for any allergic reactions - what procedures are required to perform if this happens?;
, Have this in sight near the telephone during the babysitting. In particular, have the parent's cell phone contact details readily available.
 Always ask if it is okay to bring along your own toys, games and snacks. Some parents may prefer that you only use what is in the house. If they do let you bring things, the novelty factor can make it easier to care for the children.
 This is useful for emergencies but also for texting any questions that aren't urgent but might be concerning you, such as where to find a pacifier, etc. You can also use the phone's alarm to remind you of bedtime for the children.
, At this age, they will want to act older so tell them that you trust them enough to help tell you were things are, or help wash the dishes that will make you like friends.
 Don't do everything for them. Let them help make lunch or dinner. They will be creative in their own way so don't be afraid to get messy.
, Also, let them help make their parents bed and straighten up their room.

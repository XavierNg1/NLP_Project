 Twiztid's paint is rather simple, so you shouldn't take that long to do it.Use white as the base, then black as a ring around the eye (see the picture of the band at the beginning of this article for placement).;
, The person going as Jamie Madrox should have black hair with some shaved spots, with the non shaved sticking up, as shown in the above picture. Monoxide on the other hand has the same style, but with blond hair in place of black. I suggest using rubber bands or scrunchies to keep your hair up like that.
 You can both wear white dress shirts (covered in fake blood), a bulletproof vest over a grey t-shirt over a black long sleeve, or any type of Twiztid merchandise. The latter of these outfits can be bought at www.hatchetgear.com.

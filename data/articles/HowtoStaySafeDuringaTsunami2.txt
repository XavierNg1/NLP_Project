 Since earthquakes are one of the most obvious signs of tsunamis, you need to make sure you are safe during that event. If you feel an earthquake, take cover under a doorway, table, or somewhere similar.

Remember to drop to the floor and take cover., After you suspect a tsunami is on its way, you should take a minute or two to organize your family. Make sure you know the location of young children, your significant other, and elderly relatives (if they are with you). Explain to everyone that they should follow you closely.

If you can do so safely, you should also gather pets and bring them with you when you evacuate., Once you become aware of an impending tsunami, you need to immediately move away from the shore and toward higher ground. The pace at which you move to higher ground may have a substantial impact on whether you survive the tsunami.

Try to move at least 2 miles (3.2 km) from the coast or 100 feet (30 m) above sea level. Ultimately, though, the higher and farther inland you go, the safer you will be.
While trees or tall buildings arenâ€™t a recommended way to survive a tsunami, if you have no other option, you should move as high up as you possibly can., While your immediate goal is to move to higher ground, you should try to stick to a pre-planned evacuation route if possible. This is important, as following an evacuation route will limit the chance of you inadvertently putting yourself into danger., One of the biggest dangers of a tsunami event is the chance of continued tsunamis or large waves. Because of this, wait until you get official word from local authorities before you return to low lying areas.

 Players are less cautious if they think that no one is watching. Walk up from behind and carefully make sure they're not moving.
 They can keep a close eye on certain people, and inform you where the person tends to move the most. Make sure you tell them not to make much sound when they spot movement, because the players will immediately know to be cautious.
 Players will know that any large movements, such as moving their legs, will be spotted, so they will prefer to move in parts that can be easily hidden. If their face is covered, try to lean over them without alerting the player.

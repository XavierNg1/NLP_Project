 This can help you find any breeders in your area or groups dedicated to the breed that may point you in the right direction.
 Shelters usually have an over abundance of kittens and cats. Although they are not usually purebred cats, there is a chance that you could stumble upon a Birman if you know how to recognize one.
 This is a sure way to make sure you are getting a reputable stock of Birman. A great example of this is the The International Cat Association (TICA) who's website includes breeder listings and criteria to look for on your own. They also have information on exhibitions and shows where you can get into contact with Birman breeders.

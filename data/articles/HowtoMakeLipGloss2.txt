 This type of gloss requires a little more forethought, but the results are well worth the extra effort and expense. You'll need the following natural ingredients to make peppermint lip gloss:


2 tablespoons coconut oil
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped beeswax
5 drops peppermint oil

, This type of lip gloss hardens pretty quickly, so you'll want to have your containers on hand for when it's ready to be poured. Use small chapstick pots or tubes, or you can pour the entire mixture into a small mason jar.
 Beeswax is hard at room temperature, but when you melt it and mix it with other ingredients it creates the glossy, waxy texture you want to achieve. Place the chopped beeswax in a double boiler and simmer it until it's entirely melted.
 Place the coconut oil and olive oil in the pot with the beeswax. Use a spoon to stir the ingredients well. Add the peppermint oil and stir.









For looser, oilier gloss, you can add an extra teaspoon of coconut oil.
For a more subtle mint flavor, use only 2-3 drops of peppermint oil.
 Carefully pour it into your pots or tubes. You'll want to rinse the pot right away before the gloss hardens.
 Wait 2 hours or overnight to use the lip gloss. It's ready to use once it's completely cooled.

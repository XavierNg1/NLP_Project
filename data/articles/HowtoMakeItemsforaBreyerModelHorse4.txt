 Make a blanket as follows:


Find a piece of polar fleece, an old blanket or unwanted clothing. Choose a fabric and pattern that pleases you.
Cut this piece of fabric into a rectangle shape. It must be large enough to drape right over the horse.
Stitch around the entire edge of the fabric piece. This gives it a hem to stop it from fraying.
You can use the blanket as it is. But if you want to add the straps that keep a blanket in place on a horse, use lengths of ribbon for this. Attach with simple stitching and tie bows to keep the blanket in place when it's on the horse.

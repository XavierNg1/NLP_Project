 Don’t exercise, lift, type or do anything to make the sore arm feel worse. Your tissues need to relax in order to heal and prevent further injury. Discontinue all activities that make the pain worse, and focus on using the injured arm as little as possible.
 To decrease swelling and help protect your arm, you can wrap the area with an elastic bandage (such as an Ace wrap). Be careful not to wrap your arm too tightly to avoid swelling around the wrapped area. Always loosen bandages that become too tight.


Numbness, tingling, an increase in pain, coolness or swelling around the bandage are all signs that your wrap is too tight.
Talk to your provider if you have to use a wrap for more than 48-72 hours.
 Your arm, hand and fingers can swell a lot after an injury. Be sure to take off rings, bracelets, watches and all other jewelry. They can be harder and more painful to remove later as swelling increases and can contribute to nerve compression or restricted blood flow.
 Slings can help keep your arm elevated and protected. They can also keep pressure off the injury, make you more comfortable and offer support. Contact a medical provider if you need to use the sling for more than 48 hours.
 Keep your arm above or at heart level to reduce swelling. When lying or sitting down, you can use pillows on your chest or side to keep your arm elevated. Don’t make your arm so elevated that you don’t get adequate blood supply.

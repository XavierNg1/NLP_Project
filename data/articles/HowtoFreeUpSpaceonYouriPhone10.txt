 Though it may seem counterintuitive to download more apps when you're trying to free up space, free apps like Google Drive and Apple's built-in iCloud offer additional storage outside of your phone's hard drive limitations., While there are several free cloud storage apps you can choose from, Google Drive has the highest ratings and is tied with OneDrive for the highest amount of free storage (15 gigabytes) up front. This is why it should be the first app you download. To search for Drive:Open your iPhone's App Store app.
Tap the search option to open the search bar.
Tap the search bar at the top of your screen.
Type in "Google Drive".
Tap "Search".
 This will begin downloading Google Drive to your iPhone., You can transfer photos and videos to Drive, which can significantly reduce the occupied space on your iPhone's hard drive. To use Google Drive:

Tap the Google Drive app to open it.
Tap the "+" icon in the bottom right corner of your screen.
Follow your on-screen instructions.
 While these apps will add to the space on your phone initially, you can likely store your entire photo and video library on these cloud apps and, since you can use data to access them, you won't need an internet connection to view your photos.

Some possible alternative apps include Microsoft OneDrive (15 gigabytes for free; one terabyte for Office 365 members), DropBox (two gigabytes for free), and Box (10 gigabytes for free).

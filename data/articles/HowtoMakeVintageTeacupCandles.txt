 Set up wicks inside clean teacups by placing the wick in between two wooden skewer sticks and taping the ends.


Place sticks with wick over the top of the cup so that the wick is standing in the middle of the cup.





;
, Place wax flakes in your double boiler or pan and turn heat on stove to medium.

Stir flakes frequently so flakes dissolve evenly. Flakes should appear opaque as they melt.






Add one or two drops of food coloring (or until desired color is achieved).
 Using oven mitts to protect your hands, pour wax into waiting teacups. Pour slowly as you donâ€™t want to disturb the position of the wick.
 The wax should appear cloudy and smooth to the touch and it is ready.


Trim wick to size using sharp scissors.

 Talk about the pieces like they are soldiers in a war and describe the game as a battle. You can also create an entire storyline around the battle to increase excitement. If your child is into technology, there are computer games, video games,and appsthat can be used to supplement their learning.


These games are also helpful for teaching strategy and can present different scenarios.
 Give your child praise when they accomplish something. It does not matter if it is big or small. Checking a king and setting up the board correctly are both accomplishments. Also, encourage your child if they are not doing well.


You may say, “It’s ok that you did not win. You still made some really nice moves with your knights during the game.”

, Play and teach them the rules while playing. Correct them if they make illegal moves. Let them make a few moves to encourage them. Make deliberate blunders and give them an opportunity to win a few games.


Once your child has the basic moves down, learning comes from playing and experiencing different scenarios.
Emphasize that learning is a lifelong process and they can always improve their game.

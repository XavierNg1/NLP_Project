 Before you join a gym, make sure that you read the fine print on your contract. If you cancel your membership, you do not want to pay a large cancellation fee or be stuck paying for a membership that you never use. If you catch these fees ahead of time, you may be able to negotiate your way out of them., Once you become a member, keep any eye on your gym's membership fees. If you see that the price of your membership is discounted, ask if you can receive that discount. Your gym may be willing to give you a lower rate.For example, if you are paying an $80 a month gym membership and see that it is now only $60, ask if you can receive the reduced price.
You might say something like, “I see that the rate for my membership went down. Am I eligible for that discount?”

, If you find that you signed up for classes or sessions that you are not using, get rid of them. It is better to ditch things that you are not using rather than paying for them. Instead, consider paying for individual sessions or take advantage of free trials.For example, if you are paying to swim in the pool but rarely use it, drop the pool and only pay for it when you use it.

 Strength-training exercises are ultimately the best way to shrink your butt. Muscle takes up less physical space than fat, so toning it up (turning it into muscle) will lift it and make it smaller. It will also increase your overall metabolism and bring your whole body into proportion.




Dead lifts are great exercises for the glute area. But when doing this exercise, be sure to emphasize form over weight. Lifting more weight the wrong way won't get you better results.
Put squats into your routine. This exercise primarily targets your thighs and butt, but also works the hamstrings and lower back. Make sure to warm up beforehand.

Lunges are another fantastic exercise for your bottom half. There are a bunch of different varieties (side, reverse, etc.), so constantly change it up.;
, Since fat is the culprit to a big butt, cardio is the quickest answer to blasting it away. Running, swimming, boxing, or cycling will burn the most calories for your time.And fewer calories equals a smaller butt.










In addition to straight up cardio, try interval training--it burns even more calories than its one-paced counterpart.Exercise full out for 30 seconds and rest for a couple of minutes. Repeat 8-10 times. Your metabolism will get upped in minutes and stay up. And the best part? The hard part of your workout is done in 15 minutes.
 If regular ol' strength training is getting a bit boring, mix it up with circuit training. While you can do cardio every day, keep the strength training to 30 minutes, 3 days a week. Alternate between a new glute-toning exercise and high-intensity cardio activity for your entire workout session.









Circuit training is about combinations. If you don't have access to a number of weights or machines, jog with weights in intervals of a minute or two. Otherwise add weights into your cardio exercises. You'll be killing two birds with one dumbbell.

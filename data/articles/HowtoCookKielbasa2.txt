 Make sure that the rack is positioned in the center of the oven.
 The kiełbasa should fit comfortably in the dish. If it is too big and presses up against the sides, cut it in half or into thirds. Do not slice the kiełbasa; if your recipe calls for sliced kiełbasa, wait until it is done cooking before slicing it.


The types of kiełbasa that work best for baking are cooked biała (white) kiełbasa and zwyczajna (regular) kiełbasa. You do not need to bake dried kiełbasa, such as kabanos.
If you wish to bake biała (white) kiełbasa, you should cook it first.
 Use a meat thermometer to test the temperature; it needs to read at least 160°F (72°C).To help the kiełbasa cook more evenly, use a pair of tongs to turn it every 5 minutes or so.


Consider adding other tasty extras, such as sliced onions, potatoes, carrots, or other vegetables., You can serve the kiełbasa as is, or use it in other traditional Polish dishes, such as bigos or żurek. You can also serve it alongside some "kapusta" or sauerkraut.

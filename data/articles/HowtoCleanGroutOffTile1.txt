 Use a dry scrubbing sponge or cheesecloth to rub down the tile. Rub the tile until the haze is removed. After you lightly sand the grout off of the tile with the cheesecloth or sponge, vacuum up all of the dust before sealing.Try this method on grout that has not set for long.
Don’t wet the sponge or cheesecloth or the dust from the grout will stick to the floor again.;
, If your dry sanding method doesn’t work, try rubbing the floor with a damp towel. Wring the towel out well so it’s relatively dry if the grout has just been set. You can use more water for grout that has been set for more than a few days. Let the floor dry before you seal the grout.


Use baby wipes for the same results. Don’t wet the baby wipes., Mix 1 cup (240 mL) of distilled vinegar with 1 quart (.946 L) of warm water. Mop the floor with this solution. Use a scrub brush to clean harder to remove areas. Don’t rinse the vinegar solution off the floor. Allow it to dry completely before sealing.Don’t use vinegar on marble, travertine, or granite., Stir white sugar in warm water in a ratio of one part sugar to ten parts warm water. Sponge this mixture into the hardened grout. Leave it alone for an hour, then scrape the grout off your tile. Keep applying sugar water as needed while you scrape to keep the tile moist.Adjust the ratio of sugar to warm water until you have an effective mixture.
Alternatively, you can apply undiluted vinegar to hardened grout to make it easier to scrape the grout off of your tile. Once the grout is removed, rinse the entire area thoroughly with plain water to remove all of the vinegar.

 Determine which tasks are most important and the order in which they must be completed.;
, Procrastination causes stress and keeps you from doing your best on your assignments. Finish all assignments promptly.
 We are human and it is difficult to always stay on task. Allow yourself 10 minutes every few hours to check twitter, play a game, or browse the web. Be sure not to abuse this privilege, use it as a reward for your hard work.
 At the very least, set your status to "away" or "busy" to keep others from distracting you.
 Many phones today alert you when someone has commented on your status or "re-Tweeted" one of your tweets. This can also be a distraction and encourage you to log onto your account on your computer. If you can, turn off your cell phone completely, as this may also distract you from your assignment.

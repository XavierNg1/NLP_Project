 One-on-one contact is better for flirting with a shy girl than approaching her when you’re with a group, which might intimidate her. Separate from your group of friends and find some time to talk to the girl you like when you’re both alone.


If you’re in school, this may mean talking to her by her locker or as she’s walking to her car.
 She may be shy, but she’ll likely appreciate your taking notice of her new haircut or her cute shirt. Even better, point out a non-physical attribute about her that you like, such as her kindness, cheerfulness, or her sense of humor. This will build up her confidence and make her feel more secure around you., This will allow you to spend more time with her and to build up your relationship as she gets to know you more. Suggest something simple like grabbing lunch together during recess or going out to a movie with friends, if you see that she’s comfortable in groups.


Don’t aim for date-like situations. All you want to do for now is find opportunities to allow you to get to know each other. Dating, for a shy girl, may be a concept that she needs to warm up to, and warming up includes getting to know the person she might go on a date with.

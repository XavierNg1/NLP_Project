 You want to wash your nectarine prior to eating it. Run your nectarine under cold water, turning it to make sure to wash the full surface. Wipe off any dirt or debris stuck on the nectarine.You should also wash your own hands before washing a nectarine.
 Nectarines taste best, and are easiest to eat, at room temperature. If you were storing your nectarine in the fridge, place it on the kitchen counter. Wait until the nectarine is at room temperature to eat it., There is no harm in eating your nectarine with the skin still on. However, some people dislike the taste or texture of nectarine skin. If you would prefer to peel the nectarine first, doing so is simple.Place the nectarine in a pot of boiling water. Leave it there for a minute.
Remove the nectarine from the water. Place it in ice water.
Once the nectarine is cool, you can easily remove the skin. It should slip off.
 After the nectarine is peeled, you can eat the nectarine. You can eat it the way you would eat an apple or another round fruit.


Remember a nectarine has a pit. Do not bite too far into the center of the nectarine or you'll end up hitting the pit.

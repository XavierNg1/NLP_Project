 Cut the lavender at the base of the stem when the buds are just opening. This will ensure that the dried lavender will retain a strong floral scent and remain it's bright purple color., Aim to get the longest stem possible on the flower. In harvesting lavender you are also pruning the plant, which helps it grow strong throughout the winter., Once you've harvested a good handful, gather it into a bunch. Tap the bottoms of the stems against your palm to line them up neatly.
 Wind the rubber bands toward the base of the stems. Keep winding until the stems are tightly secured, but not crushed.Using a rubber band instead of string or ribbon will ensure that the stems won't slip from the tie as they shrink during the drying process.
 Drying lavender slowly in the dark is the best way to preserve its color, since the sun will fade the purple flowers. Look for a dry, dark place that doesn't get much sunlight, such as your shed, garage, or a shaded place under your eaves.
 Loop a strand of the rubber band over a hook or nail. You can also tie a string from the rubber band to a hook or rack to hang the lavender.
 Check every so often to see when the lavender is dry. When you brush the flowers, they should fall easily from the stems. You can leave the flowers on the stems or brush them off to use in sachets or for baking.

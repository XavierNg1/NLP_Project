 Keep a record (preferably in a writing journal) of when the meltdown regularly occurs e.g. before an outing, before a bath, at bedtime, etc. Write down the A-B-C (antecedents, behaviors, consequences) of the problem. Doing this will allow you to figure out your child’s behavior and what it is that you can do to help prevent and address problems as they occur.Antecedents: What were the factors leading up to the meltdown (time, date, place, and incident)? How did these factors influence the problem? Were you doing anything that was painful or upsetting to the child?

Behaviors: What were the specific behaviors exhibited by the child?

Consequences: What were the consequences of the child’s actions for the mentioned behaviors? What did you do as a result? What happened to the child?

, Then use this knowledge to teach your child the “if – then”. For example, if the child is upset that another person has broken his toy, then it is a good time to ask for help., After you have collected your ABC information, it is a good idea to share this information with a therapist to provide a good picture of your child’s behavior in specific scenarios.

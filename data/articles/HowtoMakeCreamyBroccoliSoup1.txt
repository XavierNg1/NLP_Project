 Wash a few bunches of broccoli. Take a sharp knife and carefully trim away the tough end of the stalks. Throw away the ends and any leaves. Chop the broccoli florets and the tender, small stalks. Set the chopped broccoli aside.You should end up with about 4 cups (700 g) of chopped broccoli.;
, Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a medium-sized pot over medium heat. Chop one onion and add it to the heated oil. Saute the onion over medium heat for about 10 minutes.The onion should become translucent. Avoid overcooking the onion to the point that it becomes caramelized or crispy.
 Pour in 4 cups (1 liter) of vegetable or chicken stock. Peel and chop 1 russet potato into 1" pieces and add it to the pot. Turn the heat to low and let it simmer (bubble lightly) for about 12 minutes.The potato should be just about tender if you poke it with a fork.
 Add the chopped broccoli to the pot and continue simmering the soup for another 10 minutes. Check the broccoli and potato for tenderness. They should be soft enough to puree in a blender or with a handheld blender until the soup becomes smooth.If you want to puree the soup in the blender, carefully ladle the hot soup into the blender and puree it in batches.
 Return the pureed soup to the pot and keep it on low heat. Pour in 1/2 cup (120 ml) of heavy cream and stir the soup. Ensure that the soup doesn't return to a boil since this will make the heavy cream separate. Add salt and pepper to taste.


To make this recipe vegan, leave out the cream and use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.

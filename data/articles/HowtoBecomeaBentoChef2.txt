 A proper bento will follow the 4:3:2:1. Four parts starch (Rice, noodles, potatoes), 3 parts side dish (Meats or proteins), 2 parts vegetables, and 1 part something different (Desserts, pickles, anything else)

, The biggest mistake is packing too much food. Customers purchasing bento are often looking for something healthy, and this is hardly achieved with face-sized onigiri.
 Bento is known for cuteness, but it doesn't need to be so. As long as it is colorful and eye-catching, the bento law is satisfied.
 Bento is rarely able to be refrigerated, and often cannot be reheated due to the combination of foods. Thus, bento is lukewarm. Avoid putting raw meats, and other such things that are prone to spoilage unless you have a riceless concept that can be kept colder.

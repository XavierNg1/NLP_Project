And if you’re decorating with more than one coffee table, considering adding books to the surfaces of all tables., Create a classic look by stacking rectangular books on a circular coffee table. For an interesting, minimalist look, angle just one book on a coffee table. This works well if your table is smaller, or even if you need to use it for other purposes, like serving drinks at a party or as a writing surface., If your table itself is worthy of display, don’t detract from its beauty by placing too many objects on it. For example, if your table is made of an interesting piece of wood or has a particularly lovely surface, like rough marble or decorative glass, style it with just a single book or a short pile of like-sized books. Alternatively style it with a single vase or piece of art.

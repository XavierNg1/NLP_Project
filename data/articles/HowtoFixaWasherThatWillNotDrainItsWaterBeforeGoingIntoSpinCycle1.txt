 This method only applies to top-loaded washers. If you use a front-loaded washer, skip down to the section on unclogging the pump.;
, Open the lid of your washer, on the top of your machine. A small gap with a switch inside should be located where the edge of the lid hits the washer. Press this switch down with a plastic pen, toothbrush handle, or similar object. This tells the washer that the lid is closed, which should start an attempt to drain the machine.
 Order a replacement part from the manufacturer.
If the machine drains successfully, the switch works but may be bent out of shape. Try to bend this gently, until closing the lid depresses the switch. Replace this part if necessary.
If the machine makes noise but fails to drain, try unclogging the pump, as described below.

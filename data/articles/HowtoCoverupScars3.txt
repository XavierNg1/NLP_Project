 Certain older scars and especially raised or keloidal scars may require more effective cosmetic surgery to remove or reduce. A cosmetic surgeon will likely have several suggestions during a consultation.
 With advances in technique over the last several years, camouflage tattooing is a solid way to reduce the appearance of scars.The process is highly similar to that of getting a normal tattoo, but the surgeon uses a pigment to match your skin tone, often with imperceptible results.Scars should be at least two years old before undergoing camouflage tattooing to ensure they are fully healed.If conventional tattoos are more your style, you can cover scars with those as well. Consult your tattoo artist for the best type of design to cover your specific scar size, location, and color.
 A chemical peel is a basic procedure wherein a chemical mixture is applied to the effected area, causing several of the top layers of skin to dry up and peel off.The skin peels over several days, and it is considered a minor procedure.This is an especially effective method for reducing the appearance of acne scars., Like a chemical peel, this method removes the outermost layer of dead skin from the abraded area; however, instead of a chemical mixture, the process is completed with a flow of fine, medical-grade crystals.The finished product is a subtle difference, but it is effective against acne scars as well as the discolored hyperpigmentation of some other scars.

If you want to schedule a message to send later, just choose “File->Send Later” (or CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER) after composing an email.
This will prompt you with the time and date in a "pop-up" window, select the time and date and Click on “Send at specified time”.
If you want to use the default Thunderbird Send Later functionality you can choose “Pass through to Send Later”.
And that’s it !!!

 Now's the time to add the extract and food coloring you wish to use. If you don't want the whole batch of fondant to be the same color, separate the dough into pieces before adding different food coloring to each.
 Tip it out onto your work surface. Lather your hands up with plenty of shortening. Start kneading the fondant dough as you would knead bread. Keep kneading until the dough is pliable and has the consistency of real fondant; you should be able to stretch it without it tearing. You'll need to knead for 8 to 10 minutes to achieve this.








The dough may be very hot at first, so be careful when you first start kneading. Wait a minute or two if necessary so you won't burn yourself.
Keep the shortening nearby so you can dip your fingers in as you go; you'll need a lot throughout the process.
If the dough seems very dry, knead in another tablespoon of water to make it more elastic.
 Form the fondant into a ball. Coat it with a thin layer of vegetable shortening. Cover it with plastic wrap so it won't dry out. Place it in the refrigerator and let it rest overnight.

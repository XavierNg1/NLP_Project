 This shed will be your garden's storage unit, where you will keep all of your tools, seeds, and other gardening essentials. Fit in a shelf if you can, as this will provide extra storage for smaller items such as shovels or pots.;
, Buy a wicker basket to place in your shed; you can get these relatively cheap from most home-shops. Store all of your small tools in this basket, as this will make it easier to find them when needed.
 You can either do this with the force of balance, or install a rack to be attached to your wall. Both ways work the same. 'Big equipment' includes rakes, string trimmer, etc.
 Any big sacks of gardening essentials should be stored in the corner closest to the entry, so you can easily access them when gardening during lighter months.
 Place any loose packets of seeds or other miscellaneous items on this shelf, as you will be able to keep all of this clutter preserved inside of the shed. Think of the shed as your garden's junk drawer.

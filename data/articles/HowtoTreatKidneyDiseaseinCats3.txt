 Older cats are likely to suffer from old age degeneration in the kidney, whereby active kidney tissue is subject to "wear and tear" and replaced by non-functional scar tissue.


The capacity of the kidney to perform its tasks is thereby reduced. Unfortunately, only once 25% of the functional kidney remains does the problem becomes detectable on blood tests.
Younger cats are less likely to have renal disease. If it does occur, it is usually because of a genetic disorder causing premature aging of the kidney, or because the cat has ingested a toxin (such as ethylene glycol in anti-freeze) which damages kidney tissue.
 General signs include increased thirst, weight loss, and poor appetite. As the condition advances the cat may become dehydrated and vomit.
 Your veterinarian may run urine and blood tests in order to diagnose renal disease, and she may run an ultrasound scan of the kidney to rule out cancer.


Kidney biopsies are infrequently done, unless the scan indicates cancer, because reaching a specific diagnosis is unlikely to alter the treatment needed.

 If you’re around friends or family for New Year’s, make conversation with them to stay awake. Keep your mind entertained by being social.


Listen to their stories.
Laugh at their jokes.
Talk to them about their interests.;
, Dance, walk around the house or even challenge your friends to a push up contest. Whatever you do, just make sure not to sit or lay down. You don’t want to get too comfortable or you might end up drifting off to sleep.
 Play games with your friends and family. Play pranks on people. Take turns making New Year’s resolutions with everyone. Do anything that entertains your mind and keeps you up.If it's legal in your city, shooting off fireworks can be really exciting.
Taking pictures of everyone in funny poses can make for a really great time.
 If you’re at a party, you can help the cook prepare food for everyone. You can even play bartender and make cocktails for everyone. Volunteer to clean up a bit as well. Not only will helping out ingratiate you with the host, it will keep your mind focused and awake.

 Use the measuring tape to measure out the correct size and use a flat edge to draw the outline using a pencil. You can also print off a pattern or draw another pattern on a piece of paper, then trace it onto the foamcore.


If you'd like, you can create ragged edges as though the part of the "building" were destroyed or crumbling.;
, Use your craft knife and cut along the lines. If you've created other pieces with sections that will represent other walls, you have a choice. Either cut them down the lines, but not all the way through, and bend them that way (filling in the gap with another material later), or cut through it and attach it using glue later.
, Glue the sticks to outsides of the doors and windows. This creates the frame for each.
 If you'd like to give it a more ruined look peel off a section of the outer layer of paper before applying the spackle. Using a pencil or other pointed end draw in bricks.
 Either way, using the pencil, draw the pattern that you want the floor to be in, and cut it out. If you decide on popsicle sticks, you'll want to glue some "cross beams" onto one side. This will best allow them to stick together.

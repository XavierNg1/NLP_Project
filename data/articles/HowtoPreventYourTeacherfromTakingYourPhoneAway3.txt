 Teachers often resort to confrontational measures like confiscating cell phones because other actions fail to work (e.g. a reprimand in front of the class). If your teacher sees you using your phone and warns you to put it away, apologize, tell them it won’t happen again, and stop using it immediately. Using the phone again will only seem disrespectful and push your teacher to take stronger action.If you are caught in this situation, say, “I apologize, it won’t happen again. I will put my phone away immediately.”

, Picture your classroom from your teacher’s perspective. Ask yourself where they might be looking when they are sitting or standing in front of the classroom, and what movement or actions might catch their eye. Always look at your teacher while they are speaking, appear focused and interested, and:Avoid looking down at your phone for more than a few seconds at a time
Participate in group discussions as much as possible to convey that you are engaged in the day’s lesson
If you are going to text in class, pre-program generic responses on your phone to avoid lengthy typing (such as, “I’m fine, how are you?”)

, If you have a legitimate reason for needing access to your phone in class (e.g. family crisis, health issues) get a written note from a parent, doctor, or other influential individual. If this is not possible, simply visit or contact your teacher outside of classroom hours to request permission to use your cell phone in class. Approach your teacher in a straightforward way to demonstrate respect for them and their classroom rules.Say something like, “There are special circumstances that make it important for me to have access to my cell phone at all times. I understand your policy regarding cell phones, but I was hoping that you could make an exception given my current situation.”

 Over time, distinguish between irritation and infection. The treatments are different.


The fiberglass splinters can cause your skin to become inflamed. You may develop redness along with intense itching and small superficial wounds. Nothing but time can help your wounds to heal. It will help if you avoid working around fiberglass. A steroid cream like Cortaid or a soothing substance like petroleum jelly could make your irritated skin feel better.If the redness in your skin is associated with increased warmth and/or pus, this means you may have a skin infection. Seek medical attention to see if you need antibiotics., Even if your skin is not irritated right now, it could begin to be bothered by the fiberglass. Let a doctor remove the fiberglass for you.If you suspect that the area is infected, see a doctor as soon as possible.
 Wear gloves or clothing that do not allow the fiberglass to be on your skin. Do not rub or scratch if you see fibers collecting on the skin. Do not touch your eyes or face while working with the fiberglass, and wear goggles and a mask to avoid fibers getting into your eyes or lungs.Rubbing and scratching could cause the fiberglass fibers on top of your skin to become splinters embedded in your skin. It is best to let water run over your skin and let the fiberglass be washed off that way.
After you are done working with the fiberglass, wash your hands well and immediately remove your clothing for washing. Wash clothes that have been exposed to fiberglass separately from other clothing.Pants and long-sleeve shirts are the best option for protecting your skin. This will lower the chances of the fiberglass irritating your skin and slivers getting into your skin.
Flush your eyes with cool water for at least 15 minutes if you accidentally get fiberglass slivers in them. Do not rub your eyes. Seek medical attention if the irritation continues after this wash.

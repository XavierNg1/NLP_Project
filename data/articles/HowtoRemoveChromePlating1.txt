 Abrasive blasting (e.g., sand blasting, bead blasting, etc.) is a process by which materials are abraded with a spray of fine-grain powder or tiny pellets. Often, auto body shops and construction companies will have access to such devices. Prolonged abrasive blasting can remove an object's chrome finish, though touch-up work may need to be done on the object's hard-to-reach areas afterwords.


You may want to use a relatively fine-grain medium (for instance, 400-grit sand) when blasting your chrome to prevent damage to the underlying metal.
Note that the airborne dust and sediment produced by chipping off tiny pieces of chrome while using an abrasive blaster can be toxic, so use appropriate face/mouth protection.;
, Ultrasonic cleaners are special devices that use sound waves to clean delicate, difficult-to-clean items like jewelry. Ultrasonic cleaners can even remove chrome in some situations (especially when the chrome has already been loosened with another method). Place chrome items in the ultrasonic cleaner's basket and submerge them in a cleaning solution (often ordinary water), then allow the cleaner to run according to its instructions.


Using a solvent that can dissolve chrome (for instance, bleach, as noted above) rather than water can enhance the chrome-removing power of an ultrasonic cleaner. However, only do so if the solution you use will not corrode the cleaner or otherwise react with it in any way. For instance, as noted below, lye will react with aluminum containers.
Note that, while ultrasound machines come in a variety of sizes, most will only hold relatively small items, such as jewelry, lug-nuts, tools, ornaments, etc.

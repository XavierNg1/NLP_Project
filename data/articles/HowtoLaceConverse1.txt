 "Side A," or the shoelace presently on the left side of the shoe, should be pulled through the left eyelet second from the bottom. Remember to keep the shoelace from curling up, especially if you are using flat laces.

;
, Pull the shoelace over the front of your shoe and into the right hole lying directly opposite the hole you pulled it through. You should see a horizontal bar across the front of your shoe. The end of this side should be tucked under the side of your Converse again.
 "Side B," which currently lies on the right side of the shoe, should be pulled through the right eyelet third from the bottom. The hole second from the bottom should be occupied by "Side A." Remember, once again, do not curl the lace, especially if they are flat laces. Work your hands over the lace continuously until it is flat again.
 Pull the shoelace end across the front of the shoe and lace it into the left eyelet third from the bottom, directly opposite the eyelet you pulled it through. This should create another horizontal bar across the front of your shoe, and the end should remain hidden from the front.
 "Side A" should be laced through the eyelet pairs second, fourth, and sixth from the bottom. "Side B" should be laced through the eyelet pairs third, fifth, and seventh from the bottom. This should leave you with a column of horizontal bars without any diagonal underlying.
 Pull "Side A" through the right eyelet and "Side B" through the left eyelet at the top pair. Tie together with a standard shoelace bow to complete. You can also tuck the laces underneath the cushion of your shoe so you don't have laces hanging out of the top.

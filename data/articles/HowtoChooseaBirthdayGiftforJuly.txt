 Those with birthdays in July can be either a Cancer or a Leo. For such people, a gift based on the lion or crab symbols would work well. This could be anything from a soft toy, a trip to the zoo or aquarium, or a piece of art featuring either animal or the symbols.


Look online and in stores and boutiques for inspiration.
Stay within your price range. Don't blow your budget on a crab supper or lion safari in Africa unless you can truly afford such generosity.;
, There are different possibilities here for gift items:

The common flower for July is the larkspur. Each colour of larkspur has its own meaning: pink means fickleness, white is for a happy nature and purple usually signifies a first love. Generally, larkspur indicates a strong bond of love.






The other July flower is the water lily, which signifies purity and majesty.






You could give the actual flowers as a gift, either in cut form or in a container/seed form. Alternatively, find an item which includes the design of these flowers, such as art, books, fabrics etc can all have floral patterns which include these flowers in images. See if there is a flower fairy associated with these flowers if you like, and buy a print or figurine of the larkspur or water lily fairy.
 The ruby is the birthstone for July. Ruby jewellery would be a great present for a July birthday boy or girl, but could be a bit expensive so consider ruby style jewels or items with ruby themes––ruby slippers, perhaps? Anything red and shiny would be good, such as nail polish, lipstick, a model Ferrari even. Anything ruby-colored is a good solution.

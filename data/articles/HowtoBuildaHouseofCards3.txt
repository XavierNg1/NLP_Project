 Expensive pro-quality cards are usually smooth and glossy, and they are prone to slipping apart. Cheaper cards tend to be grainier and less slippery, and thus better for sticking together., Pick a safe, sturdy space that will not shift while you're stacking cards. Try building upon a slightly textured surface, like a billiards table or an unfinished wood table. A smooth surface like a glass table could cause your cards to slip. Consider using a tablecloth or a place-mat to add texture to a smooth surface – but be aware that these unfixed foundations are prone to shift unexpectedly.


Make sure that there isn't a draft! Build your house of cards indoors, away from open windows, doors, fans, and vents. You don't want to lose all of your hard work to a ill-timed gust of wind.
 A shaky hand or a sudden twitch can make your house crumble. Hold each card gently but firmly between two fingers of your dominant hand. Try to "float" it smoothly into place.


Try placing cards when you are between breaths, or at the "bottom of your breath" – in the moment just after you exhale. Take deep breaths, and pay attention to the brief space that occurs between exhalation and inhalation. Your body is at its stillest during this moment, and you may find it easier to keep your hand steady.

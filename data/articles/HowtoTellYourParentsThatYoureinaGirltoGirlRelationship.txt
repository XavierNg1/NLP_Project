 Telling them if you know they are homophobic is a whole other hurdle. You can use some roundabout conversational approaches to see if your fears are warranted.


Maybe do a practice like saying, "A girl in my friend's art class got kicked out for being a lesbian; what do you think of that?" If the answer is in favor of kicking her out, then beware that their reception to your honesty may be similar.
Ask for their opinions on LGBT+ issues and celebrities.;
, You will need to ask a friend or someone who you can trust.
 Do her parents know she is with you? You will need to talk about what to do if your parents are not okay with this. You don't want your honesty with your parents to affect her, too, if she's not ready for that step. Make sure you tackle the issue as a couple, as well as individually with your respective families.
 If they think you are to young to even date a boy, then you should not tell them that you're dating a girl.
 Telling the most understanding one first may help. This could be your father or your mother. You will probably feel safer this way. It also means you can have someone on your side.
 This is where you can explain that homosexuality is not a choice, and they need to understand that.
 They may cry, scream, kick you out, be supportive, or shrug. There are many reactions; hope for the best but be prepared for the worst.
 Have a long conversation about stuff like sexuality. This is so they can slowly take it in.

 At the end of the letter, you should provide your contact information. This can often just be included after your signature. Your first and last name, phone number, and e-mail address should be included. If a potential employer wants to talk to your more, they should know how to contact you. It can also be helpful to write something like, "Feel free to contact me at the following number if you have any further questions.", In the last paragraph of the letter, restate what you have said. This paragraph should not be particularly long as letters of recommendation are generally brief and to the point.


Two or three sentences should be adequate. Try something like, "Once again, I would very much recommend Lacey's services to anyone looking for a quality nanny. She is a patient, hardworking, and caring individual whose presence had a tremendously positive impact on my family.", When you finish the letter, make sure to sign and date. This gives the reader a sense of when it was written. It also authenticates the fact you wrote it.

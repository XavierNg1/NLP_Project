Explore different forms of exercise such as: hiking, biking, swimming, yoga, rock-climbing, dance aerobics or kayaking.
 Excessive stress is a significant risk factor for overeating; this is because when we are stressed, eating can be comforting since it releases endorphins in our brain that tell us we are happy.Deep breathing exercises are ways to reduce stress in a very natural and healthy way. The best part is it has no calories!


Sit in a comfortable position. Breathe slowly in through your nose and out through your mouth. Focus on your stomach moving in and out as you breathe.
 People who tend to emotionally overeat also tend to have a personality trait that makes them sensitive to rewards.So, if you reward yourself with something other than food, you can begin to alter your pattern of overeating. You can also help yourself feel happier and better when you do something positive.


For example, when you are stressed or are celebrating something, buy a new item youâ€™ve been wanting, go on a special outing, or get yourself a massage.

 Clean a milk jug thoroughly and put it aside. Use a large sewing needle or nail to poke holes in the cap from the milk container. Fill the jug with water, put the cap back on, and tip it to pour a gentle stream of water on your plants., To make a big, sturdy scoop, simply use a utility knife to cut a milk jug in half and discard the bottom. Make sure that the cap is screwed on tightly. Turn over the scoop, grip the handle tightly and use it to pick up things like dirt, dog food, or flour., Using a utility knife, carefully cut off the bottom of a clean milk jug. Make sure the cap is secured tightly, then turn over the remaining part of the jug and fill it with ice-melting sidewalk salt. Grip the handle and gently shake the jug to disperse the salt evenly., Use a utility knife to cut off the bottom of a milk jug, then use scissors to cut a zig zag pattern around the edge. Insert the seedling protector (or "cloche") into the soil surrounding the seedling, leaving an inch or two of space above the seedling. Leave the cap on during cold weather, and remove it to vent the cloche when it is warm and sunny outside., Clean out your milk jugs thoroughly and allow them to dry completely. Use a funnel to fill them with grains, seeds, rice, or other foods that can be poured out of a small opening easily. If desired, paint the jugs with chalkboard paint before using them and label each one.

 You can bake or broil any variety of pepper, but usually, large bell peppers should be roasted in an oven preheated to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius) while smaller peppers should be roasted in broiler that has been preheated for 5 to 10 minutes.Either way, prepare a baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil.
If you are using a broiler with separate “high” and “low” settings, preheat it to “high.”;
, Small peppers should be left whole. Large peppers, like bell peppers, can be cut in halves or quarters to speed up the cooking process.


Place cut peppers on the prepared baking sheet cut-side-down.
 Spray cooking spray over the surface of each pepper or brush a little olive oil on the skins. Cooking spray or oil helps with making sure that the peppers don't stick to the foil or the pan when you're ready to remove them.
 The exact amount of time will vary based on size and cooking method, but usually, bell peppers should be roasted in your preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes while smaller hot peppers should be broiled for 5 to 10 minutes per side.


Turn the peppers periodically so that the skins become evenly charred on all sides.
When ready, the skins should be dark and bubbly.
 Wrap the peppers in aluminum foil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they become cool enough to handle with your bare hands. At that point, unwrap them and use or enjoy as desired.


Before serving, peel the skins off the peppers using your fingers. If you allowed them the steam inside of foil while they cooled, the skins should slip off with relative ease.

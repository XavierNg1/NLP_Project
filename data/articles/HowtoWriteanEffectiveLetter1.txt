 If you think of your letter like an essay, the logical first step would be to craft an opening line or paragraph that will catch the reader’s attention, while also briefly outlining the letter’s purpose.


Creative openings are the best way to catch a reader’s attention. Rather than just opening with a discussion about the weather, try something more interesting. It’s unlikely you really started that letter to tell someone about the weather!;
, You probably have written essays before, and you probably opened them with an idea that was related to the purpose of the essay. Try to do the same with a letter.


You must have a purpose for writing, so rather than meandering around the point, just come out with it!

, If you opened your letter and got right to the point, then use the body of your letter to elaborate on that point.


Maybe the purpose for writing the letter is to apply for a particular job. You will want to keep the body of your letter clear and concise, but also interesting and engaging.
If you are still thinking of your letter like an essay, your opening being where you stated your purpose, then your body should be where you would logically “back up” your point, or elaborate on the idea you first brought up.

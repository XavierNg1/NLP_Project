 When you first open your iPod Touch from its packaging, you will need to charge it first before using it. There are many ways to charge your iPod Touch: one, the iPod Touch comes with a usb cord that connects from your iPod to your usb port on your computer and you can charge your iPod Tough through there. Second, you can charge it through your iPod Touch bracket charger that connects to the wall. iPod Touch will not come with a bracket charger so you would have to buy one.;
, You would have to download iTunes from the internet in order to transfer music and sync your iPod Touch to your computer. This is a must because when you lose or your iPod Touch breaks, you have back up from your computer. Google iTunes and it'll take you to a website where you can download iTunes. Click download and wait.
 When iTunes finishes downloading, you would have to enter a few of your information like email address and name and country and etc. When this is done you are now ready to sync your iPod Touch with your computer. Connect your iPod Touch through your usb connector to your computers usb port.
 You can download them through iTunes store which comes with the iTunes that you downloaded. Click "iTunes Store" and you can browse through different apps, whether you want games or utilities or just some fun and entertaining apps. Choose a free app to download that you would like to have and click download. When this is done, there will be a "downloads" button that will appear with your downloaded app you just downloaded. Click sync in the bottom right corner (make sure your iPod Touch is connected), and your app should already be in your iPod Touch.

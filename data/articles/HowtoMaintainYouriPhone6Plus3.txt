 Back up your iPhone with iTunes or iCloud. iCloud is super easy-to-use, but it's easily overloaded if you have more than one iPhone or iPad on the same Apple ID. iTunes basically allows for unlimited backups, but it can not backup the photo library and non-purchased music, movies.
 Keep your phone locked down with a passcode to avoid others to access your iPhone especially useful for a "missing" iPhone. Just go Settings > Passcode > Turn Passcode on > Set Passcode.
 If you're unlucky enough to lose your iPhone, to safeguard your device contents, you can use Find My iPhone to locate your missing device on a map, remotely lock it, play a sound, display a message, or erase all the data on it. "Find My iPhone" is a free app that you can download it in App Store.

 Admittedly this is not as easy as it sounds. Socrates considered 'knowing thyself' a life-long pursuit that takes years of self-reflection. For practical reasons, all you need to do here is to survey your drinking history to establish rough boundaries between levels of inebriation. This will set the standard to apply in the second step.;
, Very simple. Know your alcoholic tolerance and drink accordingly at the appropriate rate and adapted quantity. This is linked to knowing thyself.
 There are three things to keep in mind when thinking in the context of drinking: time, place, and occasion.



Time: Note the time of day it is. Morning is rarely the time to drink - unless it is carrying over from the night before in the very early hours (00:00-04:00). Lunch should be kept light in terms of alcohol so you can do things in the daytime.

Place: This mainly comes down to safety - where can you get safely drunk?

Occasion: Getting inappropriately drunk, say, at meet-and-greets or family gatherings needs to be avoided.
 Map out a rough timeline of how you will begin and end the occasion at which you are drinking. Obviously you need to be flexible, but having a general idea of how you are going to control your drinking will avoid impulsive and spontaneous behaviour that pushes you over the edge and into the danger zone.

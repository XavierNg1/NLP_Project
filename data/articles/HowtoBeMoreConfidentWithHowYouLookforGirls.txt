 Every day, say one positive thing about yourself. When you start to grow more confident, start to more positive things about yourself every day. For example: in a week start saying 5 things about yourself, you adore. Make faces at yourself in the mirror while you're at it. Find out the funniest face you can make. Even try out different smiles. For example: grin showing your teeth, smile without showing your teeth...etc. Choose which smile, best fits on you.;
, Try out some new hairstyles, put your make-up on differently if you wear make-up, and so on. Make sure whatever you wear it brings out your true beauty. Be yourself, when trying new looks. Don't try to follow the crowd, try to be your own kind of beautiful.
 People will suddenly be attracted to your smile. Not only you will be confident about yourself, but others will be too. Don't be offended if they don't smile back. They may be surprised you are smiling at them, in a good way.
, Never name things that you think make you ugly. If doing so, you will lose your confidence.
 Even if you are fat, skinny, tall, short. You are YOU. And THAT makes you special. There is NO one in the world that looks exactly like you. You are unique. No one could ever replace you.
 Even someone very gorgeous looking, when sad is not attractive. Happy makes everything look better.
 Buy some new clothes, that are you. Get a manicure or a pedicure. If you are a tomboy, do your thing! Play your favorite sport, and cheer yourself, and others (if playing with others) on!

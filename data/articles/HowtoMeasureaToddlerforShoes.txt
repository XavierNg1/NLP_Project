 Make sure that their feet are flat and their toes are extended straight out, since some toddlers tend to curl their toes.

Make sure your toddler is wearing socks. This will provide a more realistic measurement considering your toddler will always be wearing socks with their shoes.

Since each foot usually varies in size, select the larger of the two foot sizes and add either 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) to 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) to the measurement to account for growth spurts. Then use that specific measurement to determine the correct shoe size.
 Always allow for about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) between their toe and the end of the shoe.
 If the heel is loose and slips up and down, the shoes may cause blisters.


Make sure your toddler's shoes are flexible. Buying stiff shoes will prevent your toddler from being able to bend their feet and is not healthy or comfortable. Also keep in mind that arch support isn't necessary since toddlers will usually outgrow shoes before they are able to wear out the soles.






Choose shoes with a large width. Your toddler's bones are softest before the age of 4, so wide shoes will allow room for their feet to develop properly.






Select shoes made of porous, breathable material such as canvas, cloth or leather. Not only are these shoes more flexible, but they will also allow the air to circulate around your toddler's feet.






Look for shoes with good tread and avoid shoes with slick or smooth treads to prevent your toddler from falling, slipping and sliding.

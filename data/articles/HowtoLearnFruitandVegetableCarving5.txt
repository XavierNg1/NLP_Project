 After carving a watermelon into a bowl shape, you can fill the bowl with melon balls or your favorite fruit salad. Choose fruits that go well with watermelon. For example, you could make a salad with blueberries, strawberries, cantaloupe, and watermelon.

Avoid using easily bruised fruits like raspberries. They will disintegrate in the salad.
 Find a large ceramic, wooden, or glass platter. Next, place your carved fruits on the platter. Arrange the largest carved foods in the center of the platter and the smallest around the edge.If your platter still seems empty, add slices of fruit and vegetables or a few handfuls of berries.
 Press some floral foam into the bottom of a vase or ceramic flower pot.Next, skewer your carved fruit and veggies on bamboo sticks. Stick the other end of the skewer into the floral foam to create a bouquet.

Grapes, cherry tomatoes, and fruit and vegetable slices are great additions to an edible arrangement.
Add a few lettuce leaves around the edge to add some color.

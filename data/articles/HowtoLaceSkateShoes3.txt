 Feed the right side of the shoelace up through the lowest right eyelet and feed the left side of the shoelace up through the left eyelet to create a straight line between the two eyelets.
 Put the shoelace on the left side of the shoe down through the second eyelet on the left side of the shoe. Put the shoelace on the right side of the shoe down through the second eyelet on the right side of the shoe.You should end up with a horizontal line between the bottom two eyelets, and two vertical lines going from the bottom eyelets to the eyelet right above them.
 Take the shoelace on the left side of the shoe and bring it across the tongue to feed it up through the third eyelet on the right side of the shoe. Take the shoelace on the right side of the shoe and bring it across to form an "x" on the tongue, and feed it up through the third eyelet on the left side of the shoe.
 Repeat step two to lace the fourth eyelets to make two vertical bars. Then repeat step three to lace the fifth eyelets to make and "x". Continue switching back and forth to lace up all of the eyelets on your shoe.
 When you reach the last two eyelets, tie the two laces in a double knot to secure it.

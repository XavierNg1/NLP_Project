 When you are a victim, you should put yourself first. That means you should cut out negative and damaging things in your life. If you feel threatened, walk away. If you feel it is your fault or someone blames you for the situation, remind yourself that is not true. Put yourself first and leave.If you are in an abusive situation, you may want to contact emergency services, the police, or a domestic violence agency in your area.
 When you have suffered trauma or abuse, you may find there are people who are not good for you. They may not believe you, or they may blame you and belittle your experience. These are not people you should be around. If friends, family members, or coworkers tell you it was your fault or that you deserved it, you should step away from that person.It may be difficult to let go of someone you care about, especially in this difficult time. However, your emotional and mental health is more important. If a person is being toxic to you, they are not worth it. You deserve supportive, healthy people around you.
 If you have been the victim of abuse, you may need to set boundaries. Being around the other person may be damaging to your mental and emotional state and reinforce your sense of guilt. You may have to set boundaries with friends or family members who don’t believe you or blame you. Set firm boundaries for you and others if you need to.Cut off contact with the person who abused or hurt you. If you have to see them, do it in a neutral location and take a trusted friend or family member with you.
Stick to your boundaries. Remember that your mental health is important and that you don’t have to please others.

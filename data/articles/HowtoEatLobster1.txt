 If you go to a restaurant that offers you the chance to choose your own lobster, you may be asked whether you want a hard shelled lobster or one that has recently shedded.

Hard shell lobsters have matured enough that their shells are a little tough to break. The meat inside is firm and flavorful.
Shedders have softer shells, since they have recently moulted. Soft-shelled lobster are much easier to get through. However, they usually aren't as "full" and consequently have less meat.;
, If you like tail meat, choose a female lobster, since the females' tails are larger to accommodate the transportation of eggs.
 Now's not the time to go for the runt of the litter, or the underdog - choose a lobster that twitches its antennae and moves around inside the tank. Its color should be bright (though not red - that happens after it's cooked) and its eyes should be shiny.


Avoid lobsters that look lethargic or sickly. Lobsters with visible shell damage or cloudy eyes might be contaminated. Lobsters with tails that are curled under are likely already dead, so avoid them.

 By default, it should open in Mac's Preview app.;
, The pencil icon is the last icon at the top menu and opens up the Annotation menu, directly under the top menu.
 On some versions of Preview, the two options are separate, but on newest versions, you find the arrow by clicking the line icon and then adjusting the line style to one with an arrow on one side.


You can also select the lines option, and make an arrow with three strokes of the lines.
 Make sure the arrow is pointing where it's supposed to point. Let go of your mouse button when you're done.


To adjust the location of the arrow, you can click and drag to move it around the image.
To change the length or angle of the arrow, you can click on one end of the arrow and hold your mouse down while adjusting the arrow.
You can also change the color and thickness/style of the arrow from the menu bar by clicking on the relevant icons and making your selections.
 This will remove the bottom menu.
 When you show or add the screenshot to someone, the arrow will be there.

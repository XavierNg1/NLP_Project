 You can only bend a note on the blow (exhale) with holes eight through ten on your harmonica. Some of these notes will bend more than others, and you may find that some holes are easier for you to bend than others.You should experiment bending the notes of these blow bend holes to find which feels most comfortable to you.
You'll likely find that blow bending is a little more difficult than draw bending, although the two are similar in many ways. For this reason, it's recommended you first learn draw bending., Same as with draw bending, you'll need to narrow your mouth or block off other holes with your tongue so that you're only playing a single note while blow bending. Practice this until you can do so consistently with a full and rich tone.


Be sure you are only practicing this note on the blow. You will not be able to bend holes eight through ten on the draw., Opposite of blow bending, you'll need to start first with an "Ooo" sound (as in shoe) and transition to an "Eee" sound (as in bee). Your jaw should begin in a lower position for the "Ooo" and raise on the "Eee."


You may find it easier to punctuate your transition between vowel sounds with a T. Similar to draw bending, strike the roof of your mouth near the back of your front teeth when transitioning to between "Two" and "Tee" sounds., It may take you quite some time before you learn to blow bend naturally. If you're having difficulty, try adding variations to the intensity of your blow. You may also find that by altering your mouth shape, like dropping your draw extra low on the first vowel sound, helps you achieve your bend.

, Do this by clicking on “Files” from the left panel menu.
 A list of devices connected to your Memopal account will be displayed. Click on the one that contains the file you want to share.


If more than one device contains the same file, it will not matter which device you select. The file selected will be the one to be shared.
 Navigate through the folder directory by clicking on the folders under the selected device until you reach the folder that contains the file you want to share.


The folder directory follows the exact same path as the one from the source device.
 Tick the checkbox in front of the file to select it. You can only share one file at a time, since each public link to be generated can only refer to a single file.
 Click on the icon with three dots connected by two lines on the header taskbar. This will bring out a small window containing the public link or URL for the selected file.


Click on the “Copy Link” button to copy the public link to your clipboard. You can now paste this on your email or IM clients, or post it on Facebook or Twitter. Anyone who has access to this link can now access your file.
To download the file, enter the public link on the address bar. The file’s page will load. Once it loads completely, click on the “Download” button to download the file.

 Let’s say you’re sending your sister to the store for groceries. You make out this list:


tomatoes
cucumbers
mangoes
mushrooms
ground beef
chicken broth
milk
eggs
rock salt;
, To make that list into a sentence, begin with the person’s name and purpose, which is the subject and verb:


Alex is going to the grocery store to buy…
“Alex” is the subject, the person who is doing the action. “Is going” is the verb, what Alex is doing.
 Separate them out with commas. For example:


Alex is going to the grocery store to buy tomatoes, cucumbers, mangoes, mushrooms, ground beef, chicken broth, milk, eggs, and rock salt.
 On the one hand, some people say it isn’t necessary. Others say it makes sentences clearer. For instance, if you were writing a list about ice cream flavors and you wanted chocolate ice cream and mint-flavored ice cream as two separate flavors, you might write:


Please buy the ice cream flavors vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, and mint.
If you leave out the comma before the “and,” it makes it sound like you want a single flavor, chocolate and mint ice cream. For that reason, it is more common to put the comma before the “and” in a series than to leave it out.

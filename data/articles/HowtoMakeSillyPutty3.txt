 Make sure that you use the regular, all-purpose type of school glue and not the washable kind.You can use clear, glitter, or white school glue.
 If your glue is clear or white, you may want to add some color and/or glitter into it. You will only need a few drops of food coloring or liquid watercolor. How much glitter you use is up to you. A few spoonfuls of extra-fine glitter will be plenty.


Stir the glitter and color into the glue well so that there are no streaks or swirls left.
 You can use either liquid or powdered detergent, but the liquid kind will work better. Keep stirring until the glue starts to ball up and harden.You may have some liquid in the bowl around the glue, which is fine.
 Once the glue starts to ball up, you can knead it with your hands. This will help the glue pick up more detergent and turn into putty.


If the silly putty is very soapy, rinse it off with cool water., Squeeze it, squish it, and let it ooze through your hands. When you are done playing with it, put it into a resealable container, such as a plastic box or a zippered bag.

 If the needle does not fit between two pins comfortably then it is too large. The advantage of a needle is its thin size, which allows you to unbend pins that other tools cannot get under.


A toothpick or small tweezers are similar options that can work.
 Take care not to scratch the surface of the CPU.
 This will leverage the bent pin back to a straighter position.
 If the pin seems reasonably straight, you can attempt to remount the CPU. If the pin still needs straightening, try the credit card or mechanical pencil now that you can get underneath it. You can also continue to manipulate the pins with needle to try to get them straighter.


Always be careful when re-bending the pins a lot, as there is the risk of breakage

 Each position requires a different amount of skill and strength. If you're unsure, below are some common things that you will want to know about popular positions.

Goalkeepers need to be able to move around freely and catch very well. They need to dive and take risks, have very quick reactions and be very reliable. They are the last line of defense when everything else fails, so they need to be cool under pressure too.



 


Defenders try to stop the other team from getting into their third. Defenders need to be very quick so they can keep up with fast strikers and need to exhibit good stamina. It helps if the defenders are tall so they can clear crosses and prevent scoring opportunities. Also, defenders need to be very strong so they can stop the charging opposition.






Midfielders carry the ball forward. They will need to be very fast and have good passing skills. Also, they will need to be strong so they won't get pulled down by the opposition. Sometimes, midfielders get a chance on goal, so good shooting skills are a benefit.






The strikers wrap everything up by (hopefully) scoring an awesome goal at the other end of the pitch. They need to be quick so they can lose their markers, they need to be strong to stay on their feet and they also need to have very good shooting and heading skills.

 Boil the kettle once or twice, and leave to soak until the water has cooled.
 If there is any lime-scale left in the kettle, you can wipe it down with a small amount of bicarbonate of soda on a damp cloth. Let the element cool down, and unplug the kettle before you do this.
 Fully rinse the kettle with fresh water at least 5 times before using again.

 You will want enough room in this container to fit your bag and leave extra space for air and movement.Try a large paper or plastic bag, or a large storage container.
Be sure that you can seal the container with your handbag inside.
 There are a couple of items useful for absorbing odor, which can be found in your home. Choose one which works best for your needs and add it to the container to take the odor out of your bag. You will want to dispose of this material after you use it.Unused, ground coffee is great at absorbing odors and does not need to be shaken onto your bag. Simply place a bowl of coffee grounds in a paper bag with your handbag. You can wrap the grounds in a coffee filter to keep the grounds from getting into your bag.
Place half a cup of baking soda in the container with your bag and shake it until your handbag is covered with baking soda.
 Be sure to give the odor eater time to absorb the smoke smell from your handbag. This will take at least one night to clear the smell of smoke out of your bag.If the smell of smoke persists, replace the coffee or baking soda with a fresh batch and leave it for another night.

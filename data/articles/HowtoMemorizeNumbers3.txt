 Using simple math problems can be a great way to help your mind remember longer numbers. By associating the sequence of numbers into a logical mathematical equation, it can be a foolproof way to memorize numbers.


Of course, this method really only works for numbers that you can choose yourself because not all number sequences will also function as a math equation.
 For passwords, PIN, and phone numbers choose sets of numbers that can be made into simple math problems. This way you can memorize them without substituting letters for the original numbers.
 Think of numbers that also function as math equations and choose those. You can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions – basically any kind of math problem you want – as long as it helps you remember the number sequence.For example, 5420 is easily remembered as 5x4=20 or "five times four equals twenty."
Example: 62311 or 6+2+3=11
Example: 21293 or 21=2x9+3

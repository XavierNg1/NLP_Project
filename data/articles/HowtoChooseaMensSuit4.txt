 Most suits are made of wool. Tweed suits are also common, especially in less formal or outdoors settings. Suits of silk, cotton, gabardine, mohair, cashmere, and linen are most comfortable in the summer. Try on suits made from a variety of fabrics to identify which you find more comfortable.The fabric of the suit can affect your comfort when wearing it. While this is typically not an issue with the suit jacket, it can be with the pants, which come in contact with a greater area of your skin than does the fabric of the suit jacket.
 Most suits have buttons that match the color of the suit. However, you could customize the suit by swapping out generic buttons for mother of pearl or wooden buttons. Ask the salesperson about what sort of button options are available., There are three types of sleeve button placements. Spaced buttons have a bit of space between them. Kissing buttons are touching one another. Stacked buttons are overlapping.Suit jackets usually have four buttons, though three buttons are also common.
Sleeve buttons should be located about one centimeter (half an inch) above the jacketâ€™s wrist cuff.

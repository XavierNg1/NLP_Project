Use a detergent free of dyes and fragrances to avoid causing irritation to your skin.
Keep the detergent away from your eyes.
Note that this method may work best for your hands, rather than your face, since the skin on your face tends to be more sensitive and may react to the detergent.
Use more or less detergent as needed to cover the dyed area.;
, Soak a clean rag in warm water and dab the water onto the dye stain.


You could also apply the water with your fingers, by running the area under your sink faucet, or with a soaked makeup remover pad.
 Use a rag or cotton makeup remover pad to gently blot at the dye stain until it fades.


Note that this only works with weaker dyes and may not be effective against strong dyes or dyes that have been left to soak on the skin for a prolonged period of time.
 If the stain fades but does not completely disappear, you might be able to remove the rest with additional detergent.


If the first round of detergent does not fade the dye at all, however, you would be better off moving on to another method of dye removal.

 Try to remove the glue with a putty knife first.Hold the flat edge of the putty knife close to the counter top, apply gentle pressure and push the putty knife’s blade towards the glue.


Don’t apply so much pressure that you scrape your counter top, but keep the blade of the putty knife close to the counter.
Keep scraping at the glue to remove as much as you can before you try other strategies.;
, You can also use a little dish soap and a wet sponge to scrub off the glue. Use the rough side of a sponge or a plastic net sponge to scrub away the glue.


Rinse the sponge and reapply soap as needed.
Keep scrubbing the spot until the glue comes off.
 If the glue is dry or if there is a lot of it, then you might need to soften it by soaking the spot. Moisten a wash cloth or paper towel with some hot water. Then, place the wet cloth over the glue on the counter to soften it.


Leave the wet cloth on for a few hours and then try to scrub the spot again.
You can also try scraping at the glue with a putty knife again. It might be easier to remove after the glue has softened up.

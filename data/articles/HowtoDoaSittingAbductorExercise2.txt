 Sit on your butt on the floor with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and your spine straight.You will need to lean back a bit, and place your hands behind you for support. If you want to make it a bit harder, you can try to keep your hands off the floor to keep your ab muscles engaged.
 The band should go over both of your legs, and should be placed behind your knees, about two inches up.The band should be tight enough that it is challenging to push your knees away from each other, but not so difficult that you canâ€™t move them with effort.
 With your spine straight, your chin up, and your abs tight, take a breath in, and as you exhale, press your knees away from each other.


Press them far enough apart that you feel the muscles on the outer part of your thighs contracting.Hold the exercise for four seconds, and as you release exhale.
Do not hold your breath as this may make you feel dizzy!

, If it is your first time doing the exercise, you may only be able to repeat the exercise a few times; however, as you get stronger, you should aim for three sets of 15 reps.Try to do this exercise three to five times each week.


Therefore, you should do the exercise 15 times, stop for a little break, and then repeat another 15 times. Then, take another break, and repeat again 15 times.

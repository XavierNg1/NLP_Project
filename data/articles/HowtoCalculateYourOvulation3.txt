 Right before ovulation is the woman’s most fertile time. The body temperature rises slightly right after the woman has ovulated, then remains elevated for the remainder of the cycle, until your next period. You are most fertile during the days in your cycle directly before the temperature rise. Because the incremental temperature change from day to day is so small, regular thermometers will not provide accurate results. Basal temperature thermometers are digital thermometers available at drugstores.


The most accurate readings are taken in the vagina or rectum, but there are also basal temperature thermometers designed to take readings in the mouth. Stick with the same method during the entire process, and try to measure at the same depth and angle each time.
 It’s important to take your temperature at the same time every day, since it fluctuates throughout the day. Ideally, take it first thing in the morning, after at least five hours of sleep and before getting out of bed. Record your temperature within 1/10 of a degree. Use a dot or other symbol on your chart to mark days when other factors may alter the reading, including illness, restless sleep, and fever reduction medicines such as aspirin, Tylenol, and Motrin.The average woman’s body temperature is 96–98ºF (35.6–36.7ºC) before ovulation, and 97–99ºF (36.1–37.2ºC) after ovulation. If you get results significantly outside this range, consult the thermometer instructions to make sure you are using it correctly.
 Record your daily result on a temperature chart that allows you to create a graph, tracking your temperature changes over time. See Baby Center Sample Chart for a sample Basal Temperature chart.
 Over the course of several months, notice the day when your temperature goes up. Most likely, ovulation has already occurred at this point, so your most fertile time is right before that. With enough data, you’ll know which days of your cycle you are most likely to ovulate.

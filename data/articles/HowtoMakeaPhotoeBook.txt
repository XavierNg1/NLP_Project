 Is this just for friends and family that you will present as a gift or do you want to market and sell it? You need to know this for a variety of reasons. Professional versus Personal:


This will definitely affect the type of shots that you are using. You might want it to be a book about the growth of your family. Much different than taking some incredible landscape and macro photos that you want to share with the world.
Consider the layout. How you would present your book to your family and to the public is probably considerably different.;
, Some of your options are: iBook, Blurb e-books, Adobe InDesign and Scribus (free) to name a few.


Printing to a PDF can be an option, but there is limited interaction that is available with PDFs versus an eBook.
 It can be a deal maker or deal breaker.
 You really don't want your book to be published with only one editor and proofreader (you). No matter how good you are, you can miss your own mistakes.
 Don't rush this, or any part of the, process. Once you release it, regardless of if you fix it later, the original will be out there with all of its 'issues'. Try to get it to flow for your viewers.
 If it's for your family and friends, say a little something about the shot. Where it was taken, when (holiday trip 2013, or something like that), and a little background of the time and place.


If it's for 'public consumption', a place and time is nice, but also add a little bit about HOW the shot was done.
 This will vary depending on your chosen method.

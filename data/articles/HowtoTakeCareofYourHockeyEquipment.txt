 The number one hockey gear no-no is leaving your wet and sweaty gear just laying in your bag. The gear needs to be able to air out. So, take out all of the gear. If your skates are wet, make sure you dry them off, especially the blades. We don't want any rust on them!;
, Find an empty spray bottle and pour three capfuls of white vinegar into it. Fill up the rest of the spray bottle with water. Screw on the lid and shake. Your concoction is made!

, Spray inside gloves, skates, chest protectors, etc. The more the better.
 Usually a little warm water and soap does the trick. YouÂ don't want to put a bacteria full mouth guard into your mouth!

, Just make sure all or your gear is dry before you put it back into your bag for next time.

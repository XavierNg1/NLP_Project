Life

Casualty
Motor Vehicle
Personal lines of property or casualty insurance, For each line of authority, you need twenty hours of pre-licensing courses. While you can find both online and classroom courses, at least 7.5 hours must take place in a classroom, not online.You can look up local pre-licensing courses through the Illinois Department of Insurance.The motor vehicle line of authority requires 12.5 credit hours, with 5 hours in the classroom., After you have finished your pre-licensing courses, you will receive a signed certificate. If you do not receive this certificate immediately, ask your program or course director to send it to you. Keep this safe as you will need to present it before your producerâ€™s exam.

If you are currently licensed in a different state or if your license in a previous state was canceled within 90 days, you will not have to take the pre-licensing course or the examination. Instead, you will provide proof of your certification and good standing in the other state when applying to the National Insurance Producer Registry. To do that, you should request a letter of clearance from that state.

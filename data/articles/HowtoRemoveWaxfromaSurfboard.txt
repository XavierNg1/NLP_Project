 You can soften using any one of several techniques:


Put your board in direct sunlight for a few minutes. On a warm day the wax will be turn shiny and slightly gooey within a few minutes, making it easy to scrape off.
If sunny weather won't oblige, pour some hot water onto the board.
Point the hot air from a hair dryer set on low to a spot right before you scrape.
Do nothing. If you don't have the time or tools to soften the wax, you can still get rid of the old wax. However, not softening it will make the scraping that much more difficult and slightly less effective.;
,,


There are some products available (e.g. "Pickle Wax Remover" by Team Chow), which you rub over the board after removing most of the wax by scraping. This will help with removing those last bits of wax. Pure melted coconut oil can achieve the same effect. If rubbed off with a wool blanket scrap, the scrap can then be composted., Dispose of the wax ball responsibly.
 (This is optional.)

 Eating low-glycemic foods will allow sugars to release into your bloodstream at a slower pace. This allows your body to process the sugars more easily. Lower GI foods include:Brain cereals, muesli, and rolled oats.
Whole wheat, pumpernickel, and whole grain breads. Whole grains are also beneficial. The lowest GIs are located in whole grain pasta, barley, and brown rice.
Most vegetables, except for beetroots, pumpkin, and parsnips.
Most fruit, except for watermelon and dates. Fruits like mango, banana, papaya, pineapple, raisins, and figs have a medium GI index.
Nuts.
Legumes.
Yogurt.
 Look for Vitamin A high foods such as:Vegetables like sweet potato, spinach, carrots, pumpkin, broccoli, red peppers, summer squash.
Fruit like cantaloupe, mangoes, and apricots.
Legumes like black eyed peas.
Meat and fish, particularly beef liver, herring, and salmon.
 Look for Vitamin D high foods such as:Fish like cod liver, salmon, and tuna.
Dairy in the form of milk, yogurt, and cheese.
Vitamin D can also be absorbed through exposing yourself to the sun at least 10â€“15 minutes a week. Always wear sunscreen to protect your skin from UV rays.
 Omega-3 fatty acids can help give you a natural glow and prevent the development of acne, including deep pimples. Look for foods high in omega-3 fatty acid such as:


Seeds and nuts like flaxseeds and flaxseed oil, chia seeds, butternuts, walnuts.
Fish like salmon, sardines, mackerel, and whitefish.
Vegetables like spinach, sprouted radish seeds, and Chinese broccoli.
Cook with herbs like basil, oregano, cloves, and marjoram.
 Stay away from these types of foods, as bacteria loves sugar and feeds off of it, leading to the development of more acne. Look at the labels of food at the grocery store before buying it to confirm it does not contain any processed or artificial sugars.

 The best vinegar to use is plain white distilled vinegar, which is inexpensive and effective.A higher concentration of vinegar may be even more effective, so adjust the vinegar to water ratio based on the severity of the water spots.;
, Spray the solution on the glass, being sure to fully saturate any stubborn water spots or areas of concentrated buildup. Allow the vinegar to soak, and reapply a couple of times for particularly dirty areas.
 Soak a rough towel in vinegar and water, and spread it over the sprayed area of glass. You can allow the towel to sit over the area so that the vinegar can soak in thoroughly.
 Use your rough, soaked towel to scrub the glass. You should not have to scrub hard. The bumps on the towel should act as an abrasive to help remove the spots and allow the vinegar to penetrate the mineral build-up.
 The worse the stains are, the longer the vinegar will need to do its work. Let the vinegar soak in, and reapply if it seems to be drying out.
 You may want to spray the area once more with your vinegar solution or plain water, then towel off with a clean, dry towel (or paper towel) or use a squeegee to remove the water. Be sure you do not allow the vinegar solution or water to dry on the surface of the glass, as this will continue to leave more spots.

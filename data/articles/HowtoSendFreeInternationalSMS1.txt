Some well-know sites include AFreeSMS.com, Yakedi (Australia), SMSPup, and Text4Free.;
, Many sites require you to register a username and email address to send messages. Some sites even trade free SMS for help filling out surveys. For example, to use SMSPup you need to fill out a brief survey, allowing you 5 free text messages when you finish.
 While you may be required to give your phone number to receive replies, you should never give your address, credit card information, or social security number over the internet.Some sites will require you to make an account to send SMS. However, you should be able to provide just your name and email address to get started.
 Each country has a designated code before the number. The US, for example, is +1. Select the country you wish to send to and the site will automatically add the country code for you., Most sites will come with a small box that has numbers and letters randomly displayed. Copy this verification code into the box to send your message.


Verification codes ensure that "bots" (automated internet programs), donâ€™t send spam to random phone numbers., A pop-up will confirm if the SMS is properly sent to the server. From the server your message will hopefully go straight to your friend.

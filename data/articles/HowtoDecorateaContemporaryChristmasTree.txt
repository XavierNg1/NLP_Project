 In particular, it is important to choose items that are elegant and reflect the beauty of Christmas in winter:


White organza
Painted birch twigs
Snowflakes
Icicles
Crystal beaded garlands
Assortment of baubles and ornaments
Assortment of larger baubles and ornaments;
, Unwind your string of lights. LED lights are a better option than regular fairy lights. If one LED bulb goes out, the rest will still work unlike fairy lights. Although they are more expensive, they are much more energy efficient and safer, as they stay cool to the touch. They will also last longer, so you won't have to buy a new set every year.
 Find the end of your string of lights and twist a piece of wire around the last bulb. Wind the wire around the top of the tree to secure the lights to the tree. You may need to stand on a stool or stepladder to reach the top of the tree.
 Push the branches of the tree between them to ensure that the lights stay in place.
 Take a roll of white organza.


Cut the fabric in half along the length of the material.
Gather the fabric all the way down the roll. Wind a piece of wire around the end of one strip and attach it to the top of the tree.
Drape the organza in a spiral around the tree all the way to the bottom, placing one strip after another. Lay it on roughly at first and then tidy it up once it is in place. Twist a piece of wire around the ends and secure it to the tree.
 You can buy these from any florist in a number of colours.



You can rest some snowflakes on top of the branches further in towards the tree trunk to add depth.
, Thread some wire through the bauble and twist it onto a branch.


Use clear glass and silver baubles to carry on the wintry theme. Hang them anywhere you like, including on the birch twigs, to fill in any gaps on the tree.
Leave any special baubles you have until last and give them pride of place in a spot where they will stand out.
 Adjust where necessary. Admire your decorating efforts.

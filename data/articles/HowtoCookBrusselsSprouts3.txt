, Run the Brussels sprouts under cold water, removing any yellow leaves. Then, cut off the stems to help them cook.
 Drizzle them with the black pepper, olive oil, and 3/4 tsp. (4 g) of the salt.
 This will combine the flavors and will cook them evenly.
 After 30 minutes, start checking to see if they're tender by piercing them with a fork. Shake the pan from time to time to ensure that they cook more evenly.
 Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 tsp. (1 g) of salt on the Brussels sprouts and enjoy them while they're hot.

 This will strip any leftover colour out of the hair, resulting in a ginger tone.;
, If you have dark hair you will need to bleach your hair more than once. If you already have light hair you should only need one go of bleach, about. It is much safer, if you have dark or red hair, to see a professional to bleach it for you. It will be more expensive, but your hair will thank you.
 Use hair masks during those "break" periods. This will help minimize the amount of damage the bleaching will do to your hair. The end result should be a very very pale blonde, after you have bleached all the yellow and orange you can out of it.
 Choose which shade you prefer, In regards to Special Effects hair dye: Atomic Pink is darker but extremely vibrant and Cupcake Pink is a pale baby pink. Audrey has had both these colours, currently using the cupcake pink.
 It is also good to put some heat on it (wrap it up in plastic or hairnet, and blow direct heat from a hairdryer for thirty minutes on, thirty minutes off, for a few hours.) The longer, the better and brighter!

 We tend to be nervous about things that are unfamiliar to us. Take the time to practice. You do not need to memorize your speech word for word, but you do need to familiarize yourself with your main points, introduction, transitions, conclusion, and examples. At first, practice alone. This will give you a chance to iron out any uneven spots in your speech. Read it out loud. Get used to hearing yourself. Test the wording and make sure you are comfortable with it.


Then practice in front of the mirror or videotape yourself so you can see your gestures and facial expressions.
 If you start your speech off well, your speech anxiety will drop considerably. Then you will likely feel more comfortable throughout the rest of your presentation.


Although you don’t need to memorize the speech, be very familiar with how your speech begins. This will allow you to start the speech confidently and with authority.
 Find friends, colleagues, or family members who are willing to listen to your speech. Ask them to provide suggestions. This will give you the chance to become more familiar with speaking in front of an audience. Consider it a test run for speech day.
 If it’s possible, practice in the room where you will actually present your speech. Take note of how the room is set up. Find out what the acoustics sound like as you speak. Stand at the podium or front of the room and get comfortable here. This is, after all, where you’ll be presenting from.

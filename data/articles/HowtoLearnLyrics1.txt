, Look up the lyrics online and then print them out. Copy all of the lyrics by writing them down on a sheet of paper while using the printed lyrics as a reference. Copy the lyrics over and over again. You can do this in a quiet place while fully concentrated or while doing a laid back activity such as watching TV.If you’d rather type the lyrics out, you can do that as an alternative. It’ll have the same effect as writing.
You can also test yourself by writing down all of the song lyrics without having the printed lyrics nearby.
 In order to memorize anything effectively, you need to be well-rested. Study after study has linked lack of sleep to forgetfulness as well as hindered learning and thinking. Focus on the lyrics throughout the day and sing the song through a few times before going to bed so that it’s fresh in your mind.Sleep for either 7-9 hours if you're an adult or 8-10 hours if you’re a child or teen to ensure a properly functioning memory.

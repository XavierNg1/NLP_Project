 Memorizing anything takes time and effort. The more frequently you see the material, the more likely you are to remember it later. Read through the rules often and quiz yourself on them daily.


Ask friends and family to quiz you on the solubility rules at lunch or over dinner.
Keep a copy of the rules handy to review if you have some downtime.
 Flashcards are a great way to review a lot of material quickly and memorize it.Make flashcards with the solubility rules on them and some example compounds. Go through the cards until you know the rules and which compounds are soluble or not.


Carry your flashcards with you and take them out if you’re sitting in the car or waiting around for friends.
Any amount of downtime is good for reviewing flashcards.
 Mnemonics are special memory tricks that can help you memorize information quickly and easily.When learning a mnemonic, it is helpful to write it out multiple times until you can remember it. The mnemonic is only useful if you know what everything stands for!


Frequently practice writing out the mnemonic and what each letter stands for so you don’t forget.
When you get a test or quiz, write out the mnemonic first, so you can reference it the rest of the time.

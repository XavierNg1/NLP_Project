Also, try to keep them short. Don't spend 30 minutes in the shower. Stick to 5 to 10 minutes., If you use a strong soap, it can pull the oil from your skin. In return, you'd need to add extra moisturizer, meaning it's a viscous cycle. The better option is to choose a gentle soap to begin with.Look for soaps that say "gentle" or "for sensitive skin."
Also, choose soaps that already have added moisturizers for your skin.
 Roughing up your skin with a towel after you get out of the shower will just agitate your skin and dry it out. Instead, gently blot your skin dry with your towel., Whether you wear makeup or not, it's important to wash your face before bed. Leaving makeup on is never a good idea, and you'll have grime, oil, and dirt on your face from the day.Pick a cleanser that's appropriate for your skin, whether you have oily, "normal," or dry skin. The label will help you choose. You can also just use a gentle soap.
Don't forget to add lotion after you wash.

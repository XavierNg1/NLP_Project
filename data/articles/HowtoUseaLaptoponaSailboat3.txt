 Naturally, given the portability of a laptop, you can probably sit just about anywhere and use it but it might not be comfortable or practical having it on your lap all the time. Is there a suitable space where the laptop can stay most of the time? Is this space likely to be safe or do you need to make modifications to ensure that the laptop won't slide off in heavy seas? Laptops can be banged around and easily dropped if the seas get rough and this won't do the laptop any good. Be prepared to ensure that it is kept safe.
 If you can't see a naturally suitable spot already on the sailboat, consider making one. A simple fold-down table with wooden barriers built around the sides of it could work well as a quick-to-build solution for where to place the laptop.
 One good solution is to get a lined/padded aluminum waterproof/ water resistant case or bag that can be slipped under a bunk, into a storage cupboard, etc., and will keep the laptop safe when not in use. And see the moisture-safety steps below, such as adding a desiccant and it's prudent to use a dry-bag around the case or bag for added protection; a dry-bag can ensure that the laptop remains dry should it fall overboard unexpectedly when moving cargo, leaving at port, etc.

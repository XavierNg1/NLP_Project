 This method is very useful if you need to peel more than one tomato, as they can be done in batches of three or four., Place it next to the stove, as you will need it later., Rinse the skins of the tomatoes in cold water, then dab dry with some paper towel. Remove the stems of the tomatoes, then turn the tomato over and score a shallow X into the bottom of the tomato using a sharp knife. This will help to make peeling easier., Use a spoon or a strainer with a long handle so that they don't drop in and splash you with boiling water., Don't leave the tomatoes in the water for any longer than 30 seconds, or else they will begin to cook and become mushy.



Place them immediately into the bowl of ice water you left beside the stove. This will cool the tomatoes down and stop any cooking that may have begun.
 When the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, remove them from the ice water. The skins should be wrinkled and loose. Grab a corner of skin where you marked the X earlier and pull. The skin should come off very easily. Continue working your way around the tomato until all of the skin has been removed. If the skin is sticking at any point, you can use a small serrated knife to cut it away., You can also seed the tomato, if necessary. Then continue with your recipe, as normal.

 If you dog gets a bee sting and then collapses, he is most likely having an anaphylactic reaction that requires urgent veterinary care. Remove the stinger and take your pet to the vet immediately.


The faster you get to the vetâ€™s office, the more likely it is that your dog will be able to absorb the drugs the vet will give him.
 The vet may either give your dog an intravenous antihistamine injection, or intravenous steroids in order to suppress the allergic reaction.


A dog in shock may also need intravenous fluids in order to support his circulation and prevent organ damage.
 If you do not live within traveling distance of a vet, then give your dog an antihistamine tablet (as described in the previous section) and keep your dog as warm as possible.


However, it is important to keep in mind that there is a high risk that your dog will go into shock, which could potentially lead to death. Because of this, it is very important that you try to get your dog veterinary help.

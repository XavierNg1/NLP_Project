 This will only work for caddies that have at least one basket tier. Use sphagnum moss to line the bottom and sides of the basket(s). Then use a cutting tool, like shears, sturdy scissors, or a utility knife to cut the moss to fit the shape of the basket.


You might find that sphagnum moss clashes with the existing decor of the place you plan to hang your caddy. In this case, consider using black paper mulch instead., Fill the lined caddy Â¼ of the way with potting soil and then arrange your plants in the basket. Taller plants should go in upper baskets, where there is more vertical room for growth. Then fill in the remainder of the planter with soil.


Some plants may have specific soil requirements. Check plant care instructions to ensure you are using the correct soil.
 Because the entire basket of the caddy will be filled with soil and plants, it will likely be quite heavy. Due to this, your caddy may require special wall hangers or fasteners able to hold the heavy weight.


Place your caddy in a place where your plants will receive the amount of light necessary for ideal growth. This information should be on the plant care instructions.

 Fold the Post-it so that the sticky end sticks to itself. Position the Post-it so that the sticky end is on the left side. The sticky part will be on the inside of the fold., Fold the corner down so the right edge of the Post-it is aligned with the bottom edge. The post it should look like a square on the left half and a folded triangle on the right half., You will see a vertical crease down the center of the sticky portion and two diagonal creases along the bottom.
 The sticky end will hold the edges down. Fold both edges to the center. The Post-it should be in a “house” shape.
 It should now have a point on one end with the diagonal crease visible on the other side., Fold the end along the diagonal creases in an inward fold. This is the basic shape that will be used to form the frisbee. If you look at the post it from the open side of the folds, you should see a V shape.


One side of the parallelogram will be a single point while the other end will have two flaps.
 You will need eight folded parallelograms to create your frisbee.
 Attach the 8 shapes together by inserting the end with the single point between the two flaps of another Post-it.


Place one Post-it between the flaps of another.
Fold the ends of the two flaps over the flaps of the Post-it you inserted.
The flaps of the Post-it that were inserted will receive the next Post-it.
When all 8 Post-its are connected you will end up with a donut shape.
 Flatten the shape to get the best results when attempting to throw your pocket sized frisbee.


You can push the opposite edges of the donut shape together to transform your frisbee into a star shape.

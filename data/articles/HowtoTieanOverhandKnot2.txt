 Simply cross the end of the rope over the rest, creating a basic loop. Again, the bottom of the loop is roughly where your knot will be when finished./images/thumb/9/9b/Tie-an-Overhand-Knot-Step-6.jpg/v4-550px-Tie-an-Overhand-Knot-Step-6.jpg

, Tuck the end of the rope under the loop and pull it through the opening from the back. Note that, up to this point, these are the same steps as a normal overhand knot.

, You're basically wrapping the end of the rope around the loop once. The goal is to pass the rope through the loop not once, but twice.

, For the double overhand knot, you just double the steps of the basic overhand knot. Pass the rope back through the loop a total of two times.

, This finishes your knot. Again, this is no more complicated than the basic overhand knot. Just pass the end through the loop twice and pull to tighten.

, The double overhand knot is simply a thicker stopper knot and is used to keep the rope from passing through large openings or holes. It can also, however, help you create several other knots:



Double Fisherman's Knot: Takes two separate ropes and ties them together with two double overhand knots.Double Overhand Noose: A more complex knot that uses the same basic theory as the double overhand, put provides an adjustable snare at the ropes end., The double overhand knot is a large stopper, but you may want even more size. To do so, simply keep moving the rope through the loop as many times as you want to make a triple, quadruple, or even bigger knot. These are simply called "multiple overhand loops."

Start by entering the name of the show you want on a site such as justwatch.com.As of 2016, Netflix signed an exclusive deal with Disney to stream Disney content.Paid services are usually only useful if you already have the service or if you were thinking about subscribing anyway.
 Before you can access the show you want to watch, you have to sign up for the video service. Currently, Hulu offers a free trial week. Netflix offers a free month trial. You’ll need your credit card to sign up. Children should ask their parents.

Remember to cancel before the end of the trial if you don’t want to be billed monthly.

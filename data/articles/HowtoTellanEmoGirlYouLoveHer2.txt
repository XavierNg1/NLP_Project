 The more you know about an emo girl's true self (rather than the image she projects), the more likely she is to understand that you truly love her. Spend lots of time hanging out with her, and always be supportive when she needs you. Showing her that you're always there for her will help her be less scared when you tell her that you love her.
 Emo girls are very wary when it comes to love, and they are not likely to trust you at first sight. Avoid cheesy pickup lines that could be used on any girl, as this will make it look like you're just trying to get some. Emo girls are good at picking up sensitive emotions, so even if you feel awkward, just say what you feel. She will appreciate the honesty and be more likely to respond positively.
 An emo girl has a reputation to uphold, and it may seem like you're attacking her if you tell her in front of bunches of people, no matter how close you are. Tell her in a private place that's not a bedroom (so it doesn't just look like you want to hook up). Be ready for rejection at first, and don't get mean or upset if she says she's not interestedâ€”emo girls are in the habit of rejecting people who try to get too close for fear of getting close.
 Be ready to answer her if she asks why you love her. Emo girls are used to being judged and used, so know enough about her that you can say more than "I love you because you're pretty." This may make it seem like you're just trying to get a pretty girlfriend. This is especially scary if you're not an emo yourself, as commenting only on her looks may make it seem like you'll want her to change her style in the future.

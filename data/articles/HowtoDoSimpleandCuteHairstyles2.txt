 The most important thing you'll need to make a sock bun is a spongy donut-shaped item to wrap it around. Hair donuts are what give the sock bun its perfect shape. You can either buy a hair donut or make one for yourself by cutting the toe off of a tube sock.Discard the toe. The remaining sock tube will be your donut. You don't have to shape the tube; it will take on a donut shape further on.
 Use the techniques discussed elsewhere in this article. Place the base of your ponytail wherever you want your bun to sit. The most popular position for a sock bun is on the crown of your head starting from a high ponytail. It's better to use a thin hair tie rather than a bulky scrunchie, as a scrunchie may cause bumps in your bun.
 If you're using a hair donut, just put it on just as you would a scrunchie. If you're using a sock, pull it down to the base of your ponytail. Then, take one edge of the sock and roll it up into itself until it takes on a solid donut shape around your hair., Bring the donut up to the tip of your ponytail. Spread the ends of your hair evenly around the donut. Then slowly roll the donut down towards the base of your ponytail, wrapping your hair with it., Tuck any loose strands into the donut. If you can see the donut through gaps in your hair, gently spread your hair out a bit to cover them. Depending on how tight you've rolled your bun and how thick your hair is, you may not need to secure it any further. If your hair is very fine or you've rolled it loosely, secure your bun with a few bobby pins.

 Go to the app menu of your phone and tap the Buffer app icon to start the app.


If you do not have the app installed on your phone, visit your respective store and download the app for free.
 When Buffer starts, it takes you to the “Let us get started” screen. On this screen are three buttons: Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedln. Tap “Facebook” and you will be directed to the authorization screen.
 Enter your Facebook login details. On the first box, type your email, and on the second box, enter your registered password. Tap the login button below, then tap “OK” to allow Buffer to receive your public profile, groups you manage, and your email. Buffer will use this information when autoposting to your Facebook account.


Select the group of people that Buffer will post to. On the second pop-up question, tap the drop-down menu that appears. Under this menu is a list of groups. Some of these are Friends, Public, and Family. This depends on the groups of people you have on Facebook. Tap on one group to select it. Tap “OK” to proceed to the Buffer dashboard.


Compose your post. Tap the “Compose an Update” box. This box is found at the bottom most part of the screen. A text box for composing your post will show up. The phone keyboard pops up too. Use your keyboard to type the post on the text box.
 When done composing, hit the “Schedule” button at the bottom right of the screen. A calendar will pop up showing the current day, month and year.


Tap the day section and touch the appropriate day. Then touch on month and choose the exact month for posting the message. Tap “Next” below the screen to go to the page for setting the time.
Time is shown in hours and minutes. There is also the part for choosing AM or PM. Tap the hours option and select the hour of the day when to post to Facebook. Then tap the minutes section and choose the minute of the hour when to post.
 Your post will automatically be published when the time and date you set comes.

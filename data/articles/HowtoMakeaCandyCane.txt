, Try to pour in strips about six to eight inches (15-20cm) long. Place this into the preheated oven to keep it warm while you make the red part.

, Now it needs to be pulled. Candy pulling is a bit of an art form but it's also fun, so don't be frightened of it. It helps to wear food-grade gloves sprayed with vegetable oil, to prevent sticking and protect your hands from the heat. Hold the candy with both hands, one end each, and pull as if you're trying to make a rope. Bring the length back in and twist it together. Then pull out again to a long rope. Keep doing this until the candy looks opaque and glossy. When it reaches this texture, it will only be just warm; shape into a 2 inch (5cm) thick roll, place on a lined cookie sheet and pop into the warm oven to keep it warm while you work on the white part. This ensures that it remains pliable and doesn't dry hard on you.

, Repeat the process outlined in the previous step, rolling into a rope shape, twisting and so on, until it becomes pearly white and glossy. As with the red candy mixture, finish by shaping into a 2 inch (5cm) roll.

Cut a 5 inch (12.5cm) portion from each log.
Pull the two lengths together, gently twisting them into one another to form the stripes.
Use oiled kitchen shears to cut candy cane lengths from the twisted roll (about 8 inches/20cm is adequate).
Shape the hook on top of each cut candy cane.
Repeat with remaining candy mixture. It can be returned to the warm oven at any stage for making it pliable again if needed but never leave in too long or you'll get a melted mess.
 Once set, they're ready to share. You're now an official Christmas Candy Maker extraordinaire!

 Birds are attracted to the sound of dripping or moving water. You can buy a birdbath or create a shallow pond with a fountain. Make sure it is close to the ground and not made of slippery material. If you are short on time or resources, hang a water-filled container with a hole on the bottom above a dish. Try not to place the water source near trees or bushes where cats might hide. Also, make sure the water is not more than 1 inch (2.5cm) deep.Consider using a heated water source during the winter. For the sake of sanitation, find a bath that is easy to clean. Ensure that the water does not become stagnant or harbor algae., Pesticides are harmful to birds in more ways than one. First, they kill vital sources of food for some species. Second, the chemicals in the pesticides can be dangerous for birds to ingest. In order to attract birds to your property, use natural forms of insect control instead of chemicals on your lawn, trees, and shrubs., Cats, snakes, raccoons, and rats prey on songbirds or their eggs, killing millions every year. No matter how hospitable your yard may seem, having a cat prowling around will act as a disincentive. Keep your cat away from feeding, drinking, and nesting areas if you are seriously interested in attracting birds. Hole restrictors, baffles, and tube entrances are good ways to secure birdhouses. Mounting the the house well above ground and using predator repellent are two added safeguards.

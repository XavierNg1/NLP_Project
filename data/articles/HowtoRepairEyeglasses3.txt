 Fill a small pot with water and set the flame to "high." Because you're going to use heat for this repair, the frames of your glasses must be plastic for it to work.
 Once the water is boiling, hold the broken edges of the glasses over the pot and close enough for the heat to soften the edges.
 Push a short pin into one edge and then push the other edge onto the pin. While the plastic is still hot, smooth it over the pin. Never put plastic eyeglass frames directly over a flame.

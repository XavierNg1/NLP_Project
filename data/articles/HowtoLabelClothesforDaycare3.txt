 The most basic version of stick-on labels is to use masking tape or painters tape and label it with a permanent marker. Cut a piece of the labeled tape and adhere it to your child’s clothes or the tag of the clothing.
 Some stronger tapes can last through a few washes, but in most cases you’ll need to put a new label on every day.
 You can also purchase sticker labels from online retailers and kids’ stores. Many companies produce labels to attach to the tags of children’s clothing. These labels last through the laundry but aren’t as durable as fabric labels.However, they are easy to apply and don’t show through on other parts of clothing.
 Stick-on labels are the easiest type of label to be removed, and may not be the best option if your child will fidget and pick at the label, or if they are around other children who will pull at the label.


They are, however, one of the less expensive options and easy to apply.

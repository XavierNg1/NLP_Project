 Doing things together will keep your relationship active and interesting. When you have some common interests, whether it’s cooking together, skiing together or learning a new skill together, your relationship will have more longevity.
 Does your girlfriend really like dancing but you don’t? Make an effort to do some of her favorite activities, even offering to do them without her asking first. She’ll probably do some of your favorite activities in return.
 Get to know the important people in her life. Don’t assume that she will spend all of her time with you or your friends. Offer to invite her friends or family over for dinner or on an outing. If you want to be in your girlfriend’s life, then you need to accept the other people in her life as well.Be friendly and good-natured with her family and friends.
 Put down your phone and actually spend time with her. Shut out the external distractions, such as friends sending you texts or sports scores. Show her that she’s worth your attention by giving her your full attention.
 Spend time being affectionate, cuddling up to her in the morning or when you go to bed. Being physically close doesn’t always mean sex, and snuggling while you watch a movie or when you’re talking can be a good way to make your girlfriend feel special and loved., Make romantic gestures by scheduling date nights and making them special. These don’t always need to be expensive dinners or moonlight strolls, and they don’t even need to be in the evening. But they should show that you are making an effort, whether it’s planning a hike and a picnic, or going to see her favorite band in concert.


Even date nights spent at home can be romantic if you’ve put some effort into them.

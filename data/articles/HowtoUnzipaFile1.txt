 On an XP or newer systems, your Windows machine has a built-in extractor program. Double-clicking the zipped (.zip) file will open the built-in system. Alternatively you can right click on the zipped file and select "Extract all". This will also open the built-in extractor program.


If you have a pre-XP Windows machine you will not have the built-in extractor program. Instead you will need to download an extractor software such as WinZip. To use WinZip follow the directions in that section.
You may also use this right-click method to unzip using an extractor program other than the default one by selecting "open with" and choosing from the your list of downloaded programs.;
, Use the "browse button" to select where you want your newly extracted files to go.
 Once you have chosen your files and their destination, hit the "Extract" button.
 Go to the file folder you specified in the last step and retrieve your now unzipped files.

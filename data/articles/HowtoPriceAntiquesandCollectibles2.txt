 It’s important that the person who appraises your item is a trustworthy professional. You don’t want to waste your money on an “appraiser” whose information is not correct.

It’s also important to hire a professional appraiser who is not also a dealer because they will not have a conflict of interest when appraising your item. Here are some tips for picking the right appraiser:

A trustworthy appraiser will never offer to buy your item from you. If they do, kick them to the curb.
Never hire an appraiser who will charge you a percentage of the value of your item. A trustworthy appraiser will charge a flat or hourly fee for their services. This fee can be several hundred dollars.
Get references for trustworthy appraisers. Estate attorneys, antique dealers, and others who work with appraisers regularly are good resources for finding an appraiser. You can also find an appraiser through professional organizations like Appraisers Association of America, Inc. and the American Society of Appraisers.
Talk to several appraisers before choosing one. You’ll want to pick an appraiser who specializes in the kind of item you want to sell. Make sure to ask for a written estimate of the kind of fee the appraiser will charge and how long the appraisal will take. , Auction houses like Sotheby’s and Christie’s also offer appraisals. Sometimes—but not always—these appraisals are free. To find out when the auction houses near you are offering a free “valuation” or “appraisal day” to the public, check their websites. , A good appraiser will give you a written report that includes a detailed description of your item as well as a thorough outline of the steps the appraiser took in valuing your item. It will also include the reasons for the appraisal and a list of who handled your item (if there was more than one person). The appraiser should give you an exact number for the item’s worth, rather than an estimate.

 Although you may think "They're stuffed. They don't need any friends," they do, because it will be cute if they had some friends to "hang out" with. Besides, the more friends the animal has, the merrier!

, It will also be great if you bought each one of your stuffed animals something to carry them in also. Get small luggage - just enough to add its small clothes and accessories. Try toy stores or garage sales, where you can get some cheap things.
 You can put a small pillow and washcloth inside a shoe box. You can also try getting some mini-furniture for your pet so it can lounge around. However, nobody likes living alone, so get a mini-pet for your toy!

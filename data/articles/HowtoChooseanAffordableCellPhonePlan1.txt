 There are many cell phone providers to choose from, but not every carrier will provide adequate cell service in your area. An affordable, low-cost plan won’t be helpful if you cannot send or receive calls or text messages on that network. While researching a new carrier, check their website and review their coverage maps to ensure that they cover your region.Ask friends and family who live in your area what cell phone carrier they use. Ask if they are pleased with their coverage.;
, Before selecting a new, affordable cell phone plan, review your previous monthly statements. Notice how often you sent text messages, made phone calls, or browsed the internet. Understanding how you use your phone will help you determine what you need in a new phone plan.If you send several text messages each month, consider finding a low-cost plan that offers unlimited texting.
Opt for a plan that has minimal data usage if you don’t access the internet on your phone frequently.
 Brand new cell phones can be expensive. To save on costs, look for cell phone plans that are compatible with the phone you currently own. This will prevent you from having to purchase a new device.

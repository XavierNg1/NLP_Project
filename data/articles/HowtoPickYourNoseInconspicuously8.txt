 If something comes out, throw that tissue away and get a new one.
 Stick only the covered part up your nostrils. Try to cover with the rest of the tissue.
 Keep picking just as you do in private. Be careful not to accidentally rip the tissue, as this will reveal all and you will have to obtain another tissue.
 Wash your hands.

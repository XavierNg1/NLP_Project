 Even if you plead with them not to push you away, your friend may still do so. They may want space from you, as the bearer of bad news. Plus, if they choose not to leave their partner, they may prefer not to be reminded of the cheating by seeing or talking to you.Signs of avoidance might be that they stop answering your phone calls or constantly be "busy" when you try to make plans.
Expect that they might react this way and know that there isn’t anything you can do about it.
 It may help to talk the situation over with someone you trust after you’ve told your friend. You might decide to do this if you are hurt by their reaction towards you or if you simply need advice about how to move forward. Be sure to choose someone unrelated to the situation who doesn’t’ know your friend or their partner., Be gentle with yourself and keep in mind that you did what you thought was best for your friend. Don’t beat yourself up if they seem to resent you for telling. Take some time to nurture your physical and mental health and well-being.This can be a very stressful situation, so be sure to get plenty of rest, eat nutritious meals, and get regular exercise.
You might also perform calming activities like visiting a spa, meditating, taking a warm bath, reading a book, or going for a hike outdoors.

 Thinking about whatever has scared you (whatever was depicted in the movie, book, or otherwise) in this way can be very helpful to overcoming your fear and getting to sleep.


If the film or novel, etc. that has scared you is something that did actually happen, consider the likelihood that something this extreme could, in fact, happen to you. Chances are, it is quite unlikely that you will have a similar experience, particularly after just having been exposed to that situation in a film.
 This could be someone real or made up. For example, pretend a friendly dragon is guarding your door, ready to protect you.


You could even make up ways to make a scary scene in a book or a film look silly or funny, so that whatever has scared you doesn't seem so scary.
Imagine that you and an outrageous or awesome hero defeat whatever is scaring you in the most over-the-top way possible.
Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, you just can't seem to get whatever is scaring you out of your head, but consider this: if an author or filmmaker can make these things up, then they are just ideas. Thinking of whatever has scared you in this way might help you overcome your fear.
 Chances are the differences are significant enough that you will be able to alleviate your fears and get to sleep.


For example in the film Paranormal Activity, the characters' bed is right next to the door. If your bed is on the other side of the room, could you experience the same situation?
If whatever has scared you is fictional, then chances are it won't even matter where the action takes place, because the story is made up. With this in mind, you may be able to come to the conclusion that you have nothing to fear.

 It's called the "Swine" flu virus because it's physiologically native to pigs, and there's practically no risk in eating properly cooked pork. It is also not a type of disease that stays with you until some genius finds a cure, although the flu can last a while. On an international flight, your main concern is how it spreads among humans: Someone infected expels droplets each time he or she coughs, sneezes, or speaks and anyone in direct contact or close proximity with the sick person can ingest the virus through breathing or touching the mouth, nose, or eyes, especially after touching an infected surface.;
, Hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, and tissues are some really good things to take with you on a flight. The usefulness of face masks depends on many circumstances. You can kill its purpose if you end up rubbing your eyes a lot with dirty hands.
 A routine 30-second hand-wash with warm water, soap, and good scrubbing is a must, especially after groping those escalator handrails or check-in counters at the airport. Stay hydrated, stay fit, and get your sleep. Stay clean in general, don't touch too many publicly used surfaces. Have your family and children develop the same habits and supervise the little ones.
 In terms of swine flu, a fever is one of the big giveaways. Avoid close contact with anyone who looks fatigued, pale, or is sweating or coughing. If you are sitting next to someone you think is sick, politely request for a seat change.
,,, Always wash your hands.

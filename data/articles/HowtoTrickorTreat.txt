 Your regular clothes don't count. Be creative with the costume you choose and make sure it looks great on you.;
, Don't go alone.
 If there are no lights on, however, skip that particular house. That means there's nobody home or no candy to be handed out.
 You should receive the candy.
 after they hand you the candy. If you don't, they might think you're greedy. This may not bother you, but it might decrease your chances of getting any from them next year.

Don't keep saying the same thing over and over again every year. Improvise!






If there is no one home, but there is a bowl of candy, take the whole entire basket. Be as sneaky as you can.
 If there's no candy you like in the bowl, take a piece to trade later.
, If you're sleeping over with somebody, expect a crash and a candy hangover, though it'll be worth it!

 The quest to stop the eternal cycle of births and deaths begins with an internal realization that one is weary of chasing youth, beauty, wealth, status and power. We have done this in so many lifetimes and found earthly rewards to be fleeting, temporal and shallow.;
, For a Hindu this is believed to be the will of God. Buddhists develop a single longing for Nirvana, the end of suffering.
 It doesn't matter what you choose to call Him or Her - Christ, Allah, Jehovah, Krishna, Devi, etc. Buddhists remember the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha.
 Stop frequently throughout the day and bring to mind how God or the Dharma explains the world around you and whatever situation you currently find yourself in.
 Excesses of all sorts, (even good food is bad in excess), and other bad habits all interfere with the energy of both your body and mind. Treat your body as a living temple!

, Whether it is holding onto family, friends or anyone else, you need to let them live their own lives. This is not to be confused with relinquishing your obligations towards your dependants, such as young children, spouses or parents. Each cycle in one's life has a purpose, and when one has dependants their needs have to be met first. Renouncing them to seek God is a serious dereliction of duties that will result in further rebirths.
 Reduce your belongings and debts to the bare minimum and learn to trust that you will receive what you need.
 These are the two biggest obstacles to ending the cycle of reincarnation. The less you want, the less draw earthly life has on you. As the desire to acquire evaporates, greed, jealousy, ego and the need for power all disappear, leaving the path and mind clear to focus on God.

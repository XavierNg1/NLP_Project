Collect a harralander herb. Invest in clean harralander for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy harralanders are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.






Purchase a vial. Acquire water-filled vial packs to save you time. Any unused vials can be stored in your bank for later usage.






Collect 1 blamish snail slime. If you are currently doing the Heroes' quest, visit the fishing shop in Port Sarim and talk to the shop owner. If you lose it afterwards, get a sample bottle from Canaifis, kill a myre blamish snail, and use a pestle & mortar on the snail.
 This will create a "Harralander Potion (unf)".
 This will create the blamish oil to apply on a fishing rod.

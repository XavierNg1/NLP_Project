 Use a rubber mitt to rhythmically rub the horse’s legs, one at a time, while grooming. Move the mitt in a circular motion so that you are really able to get a good massage into the muscles.Make sure you go slowly enough that the massage is effective. If you work too quickly, the end result will just be a superficial rubdown and not a massage that affects the deep tissues of the muscles.
If you want to get a deeper massage into a particularly tense area, you can go back over this trouble area using your fingers instead of the rubber mitt.
Watch for signs that the horse is uncomfortable (like pulling away from your touch, wide eyes, etc.) as this is probably an indication that the massage is doing its job.
 If the massage techniques alone don’t seem to be working sufficiently, rub essential oils in sore or stiff spots as well. Use your fingers to gently massage the essential oils into your horse’s legs, focusing specifically on the sore spots.Lavender is a good oil to choose for its additional soothing qualities.
 Maintaining a regular grooming routine will help prevent muscle soreness, especially in the legs. It will also help your horse stay more calm and focused during massage sessions.


Don't press too lightly, as horses have much thicker skin than humans. A light brush over will not be as thorough as a vigorous grooming session.

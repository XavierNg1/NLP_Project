 Sit in a comfortable position where you’re able to keep your spine straight and breathe deep. Place your palms together in front of your chest with your fingers pointing upwards.The position of your palms is called the Prayer Mudra. Your hands are located at the Heart Centre. Your fingers should be pointed upwards but at a 60 degree angle (i.e. not straight upwards). The bottom of your thumbs should press against your sternum (the bone between your breasts).
 Start by inhaling. Then, while exhaling focus on the 3rd Eye Point and your heart while chanting “ONG NA MO.”Your 3rd Eye Point is the centre of your forehead, just above your eyebrows. To focus on this point, close your eyes and focus them upwards and inwards — as if you were trying to look at your 3rd Eye Point.ONG NA MO means I call on Infinite Create Consciousness."The ONG sound will vibrate the back of your throat, cranium and your nasal passages. This will activate the pituitary and pineal glands.
ONG should sounds like “Oooooong.” NA is short and simple. MO sounds like “Moooo."
In both ONG and MO the ‘o’ sound is like ‘oh.'

, Either in one deep breath, or two breaths broken by a quick inhale through your mouth, chant “GURU DEV NA MO."


Do not breathe through your nose while doing this part of the mantra.
Both GU and RU are short and simple.
DEV sounds like “deeeeeev."
NA is short again.
MO sounds like “mooooo."

, There is no limit to the number of times you can repeat the mantra, it depends on how long it takes you to ‘tune into’ your body and your rhythm.This chant also connects you with the Golden Chain. The Golden Chain represents the teachers who introduced Kundalini yoga.
Ong means ‘creator.’ Namo means to call upon or to greet. Guru means ‘the teacher’ or the energy that brings the light. And Dev means transparent or non-physical.

This will allow you and your family to openly express your feelings regarding the loss of your pet cat., After your cat dies, it can be therapeutic to look back at photographs from throughout your cat’s life. This is a nice way to remember your relationship with your cat and will bring back some positive memories.You may want to organize some of these photos into a scrapbook or memory box. This way you will be able to look through the book whenever you need and can easily reminisce about your cat.
 It is also possible to create some sort of memorial for your cat. For example, you could plant a tree in your backyard to memorialize and celebrate your cat’s life. Place a small marker near the tree and mention that the tree is dedicated to your cat.Alternatively, you could donate money to a local animal shelter or sponsor an animal at your local zoo.

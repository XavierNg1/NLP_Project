 It is generally easier to cut through the meat of the chicken first before working your way through the skin (which may need to be cut with a serrated knife.) The drumstick is the smaller part of the leg while the thigh is the larger, meatier part.
 Bend the leg backwards in the opposite direction of natural movement. Doing this will help you to find the back of the knee joint between the drumstick and thigh, which is the easiest place to cut.
 The fat line is a thin, white line that runs along the joint between the drumstick and thigh. Cut along the fat line, separating the joint and thus the drumstick and thigh. Repeat these steps on the other leg.

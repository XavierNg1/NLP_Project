 There are two versions of the reddit mobile site: reddit.com/.compact and m.reddit.com. You can reply to messages on either one, but you can only compose a new message on the compact site.;
, On the compact site, just click the envelope in the top right. On the regular mobile site, touch the "hamburger" menu icon in the top right (three horizontal lines). In the drop down menu that appears, select the Inbox button, with an envelope symbol.
 Select the "messages" tab to read messages other users have sent you. To reply to a message, follow these instructions:


Compact site: touch the gear icon to the right of a message, then touch "reply." Type your message and hit "send."
Basic site: touch the blue "reply" button underneath a message. Type your message into the text field and hit "send."

, Touch the "send a private message" button at the top of the inbox screen. Fill out every field, including the "are you human?" captcha, then hit send.

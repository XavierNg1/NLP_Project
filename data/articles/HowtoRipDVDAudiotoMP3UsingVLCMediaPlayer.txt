 HandBrake will begin scanning all of the titles on the disc, which may take a while to complete.
 DVDs are split into different "Titles," which are the different pieces of content on the DVD. Movies will typically have a title that is the full length of the movie. DVDs with TV episodes usually have a separate title for each episode. You can use the length of the title to get a quick idea of which one you've selected.


If the title has multiple chapters, such as a movie, you can select which chapters you want to start and end on.
Click the Preview button to create a short preview of your selection. This can help you double-check that you've selected the correct title and chapter.
 This will allow you to select where you want to save your video file.

 You can find this in the Presets frame on the right side of the window, or by clicking the Presets menu and selecting Presets â†’ Normal.
 This will add your selected title to the processing queue.


You can add multiple jobs from the same disc by adding each to the queue individually.

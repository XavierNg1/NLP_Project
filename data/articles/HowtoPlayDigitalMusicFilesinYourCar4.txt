 You can use various programs for burning audio CD collections but the method to burn a CD is usually almost the same. Here is the method you would use on Nero Burning ROM that you can follow as a generic example.


Insert a blank writable CD into your CD writer tray.
Open the Nero Burning ROM software.
Select "CD" in the drop-down menu of the New Compilation window.
Go to the Burn tab and put a tick next the "Write" and "Finalize CD."
Browse to the audio files that you want to burn using the File Browser in the Nero Burning ROM program. Simply drag and drop the files that you want to burn from the File Browser to the list below.
Click the Burn button on the taskbar. Nero Burning ROM will show you a status bar while the files are being burnt onto the CD and let you know once the burning process is complete.
Play the burnt CD in your car just like you would play any other audio CD.

 Stihl recommends starting your chainsaw from a sitting position. Set the tool on level ground, and make sure there is nothing touching or immediately below or in front of the bar and chain.Never “drop” start or “throw” start your chainsaw. These are dangerous positions that do not allow you to control your tool.
 Slip the toe of your right foot into the rear handle opening. At the same time, press down on front handle with your left hand, wrapping your thumb and fingers around it and locking your elbow. This will secure the chainsaw as you start it., Grip the handle of the starter rope with your right hand. Slowly pull vertically until you feel some resistance. Then, pull the starter rope quickly several times until the chainsaw fires.Only grasp the starter rope handle. Never wrap the rope around your hand or grasp the rope itself.
 The chainsaw will fire, but then immediately die again. When this happens, move the master control up one position to the half throttle (warm start) setting. If you recently used your chainsaw, the master control should already be at the warm start setting.
 Using the same technique as before, grasp the starter rope handle again and pull vertically. You will hear the engine of your chainsaw fire again., Once the chainsaw has started and stays running, move the master control up one notch. Just a slight touch of your finger should do it. This will keep the chainsaw running., Check your surroundings one more time to make sure there are no people or objects in your way. Slowly get up, holding the chainsaw by the handlebar. Then release the chain brake by pulling it back toward you. Your chainsaw is now ready to use.

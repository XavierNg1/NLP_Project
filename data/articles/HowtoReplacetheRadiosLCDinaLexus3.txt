 (2 top, 2 bottom) Remove the 4 bolts from the frame. This will allow you to pull the entire unit out partially. Note: There may also be a round push-pin type clip next to the bottom right screw that must also be removed. I removed it using a small pry bar.
 There are 2 screws on either end of the climate control; you should only need to remove from one side.
 Remove the 2 small screws holding the face plate in place. Pull the face plate off by undoing the clips on the sides and bottom of the radio.

 You have a couple of options for positioning your legs. You can spread your legs (and tuck your sporran and kilt between them). You can also cross your calves or your legs, but this may not be as comfortable., Press down on the front part of the kilt and your sporran. This should allow the kilt to fall between your legs., Every few minutes, check to make sure that youâ€™re still sitting on your kilt. You should also make sure that you are not exposing yourself because of the positioning of your kilt. Even if it feels unnatural at first, it will become second nature with time!

 Buy a collar that is comfortable, but also one that the dog cannot remove easily. Choose a limited choke dollar to prevent your dog from removing the collar. The collar should have tags. The tags should have the dog’s name, your name, your street address, and phone number. In case the tags fall off, you can also right this information on the collar with a permanent marker., Unlike a GPS, microchips are not a tracking device. Instead, they are radio-frequency identification implants that do not require a power source. They provide permanent identification for your pet, so if your dog gets lost and someone finds it, they can scan the chip and notify you of your dog's whereabouts.Take your dog to your vet or the ASPCA to have it microchipped.


On average it costs around $45 to microchip your pet. It is a one-time fee that includes registration in a pet recovery database.Remember to update your address and information in the system if you move to a new house or apartment.
 When you take your dog for a walk, always have them on a leash. Try not to unleash your dog when it uses the restroom. Your dog might forget that it is unleashed, and if it sees a squirrel or a bird, it might run after it.
 Train your dog to sit, stay, and release. If you only train your dog to sit, then they are more likely to get up whenever they please and leave or run off. However, you want them to sit, say, and get up when you say it is OK to get up.When you use a release word, like “OK,” you are giving your dog a set start and end time. Every time you give your dog a sit command, you need to end it with a release command, like “OK” or “Yes.” This way your dog knows that they are not supposed to get up until you tell them to.

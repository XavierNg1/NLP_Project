 It's important to be different from everyone else so that people will miss you when you're not around. Make yourself irreplaceable.;
, Do whatever makes you happy. If you do the weird and wacky things you like to do, you'll be noticed more and you'll have a lot more fun expressing yourself however you choose to.
 Though we're all a little self conscious, this can be hidden. Show the bold and exciting you and do crazy stuff, just avoid getting into too much trouble.
 When you are picking your clothes out, take some time and effort and choose what you're going to wear. Wear something that is comfortable for you.
 Wave and smile, it's a very polite way to say "hi" to someone. The more you do it, the more friends you will have.
 You need to be liked by everyone and well known. Don't turn your nose up at others. Talk to everyone. It makes you seem more interesting than others.
 If you want people to talk to you, don't come across as rude or snobby. Talk to them and show an interest in their hobbies and life.

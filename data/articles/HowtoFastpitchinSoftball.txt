 Before you play a position, learn all that you can about it so that you know how to best play it. Talk to the coach, to fellow team players, to people who know softball. You can also look at online softball websites and borrow books on the topic. There is no need to be in the dark about the game, its techniques and the tricks for the position you're playing.;

 Check the material you are welding for rust or any other debris. Clean the material until it is smooth and free of dirt or debris.
 Adjust your flame, and begin to carefully move the torch over the area to be welded. Move at an even pace in order to see your results. If you hold the flame too closely to the material for too long a period, you will create holes in the material. Not enough application will result in the piece not melting.


Move your torch in short runs so that you are certain you are getting the result you need. Pay attention to the angle of the torch and the amount of flame, and adjust accordingly.

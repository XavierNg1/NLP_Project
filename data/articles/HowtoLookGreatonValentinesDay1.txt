, A bored or miserable expression on you won't look good!

, Having fun is just as, or maybe even more, important as looking good.
 Be yourself, be confident with who you are, and love the skin you're in. Whether you're on a date or just with your friends, always remember that they love you for who you are, so never try to be different or someone else. Friendship, family and love mean a lot more than looks.

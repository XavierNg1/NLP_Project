 Hold the saddle and right-click the horse to put it on. When you get on a saddled horse (or donkey), you'll be able to move around with the usual controls.


Horses can jump much higher and farther than your character. Hold down the jump button to charge up a bigger jump.To dismount, press the left Shift key on a computer, or the right trigger button on a console.
 Use a lead (leash) on the horse to tie it to your hand. The horse will now follow you around. While holding the horse, use the lead on a fence post to tie the horse to it. To detach the lead without tying the horse to anything, use the lead a second time on the horse.To make a lead, hunt for slimes (hostile green cubes) underground or in dark swamps, and kill them to get slimeballs. Craft a lead by placing a slimeball in the center of the crafting table, then adding string to the top left, top center, middle left, and bottom right squares. (Kill spiders to get string.)

, The main difference between horses and donkeys is what you can equip onto them. While riding the animal, open your inventory to see their equipment slots:


Horses can wear armor, protecting them from damage. You'll need special horse armor, which you can only find in treasure chests or by trading with villagers.Donkeys can hold a chest, which you can store items in as usual., Feed two nearby horses golden apples or golden carrots. They will approach each other, and a small foal will appear. The foal cannot be tamed until it grows up, which takes about twenty minutes. You can speed up the growth by feeding it non-golden food.Craft a golden apple by placing an apple in the center of the crafting area, then surrounding it with eight golden ingots.
Craft a golden carrot with a carrot at the center, surrounded by gold nuggets.
Breed a horse and donkey together to make a mule. Mules carry chests like donkeys, but cannot breed with any other animal.

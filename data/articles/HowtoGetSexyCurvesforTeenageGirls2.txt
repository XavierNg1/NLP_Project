 If you drown your figure in thick fabrics that stand away from your body, you won't show your curves. However, if you wear form-fitting clothing, you can make the most of what you have. Wear clothes that fit but don't squeeze your figure.

Clothing that drapes across your figure at an angle can also emphasize your curves. Try clothing that falls in horizontal folds at your neckline or across your hips.
 If you want to add some classic va-voom, a pencil skirt hugs hips and nips your waist. Go for a skirt that ends below your knees: the narrow knee-line will make your hips look wider.

Pencil skirts should fit you snugly without showing your underwear or being too tight for you to sit.
 These will make your chest look fuller. For extra attention to your chest, consider blouses and shirts that are tight at the neckline and bust and then fall away in loose lines over the waist., As long as you wear a bra, it is time for a bra fitting. Go to a department store and ask a customer service representative to measure you for a bra. Even if you are still developing, you should know your strap size so that you don't get the wrong fit.

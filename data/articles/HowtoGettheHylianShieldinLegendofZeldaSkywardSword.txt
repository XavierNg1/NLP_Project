 Choose the Lightning Round mini-game and select the boss battle option. Start battling bosses that you have fought in the past. He will talk about a "Very sturdy shield". Bear in mind, except from the shield you have equipped, when facing the boss, you only have the equipment you had at the time. You also cannot use any pouch items that can help you win the fight.;
, You are best going with a boss from the start of the game, as they are easier, but if you want a challenge, choose one from the end of the game. He will then give you a choice of four bosses. Pick one. Use the same strategy on it; the strategy does not change. The bosses appear depending on what you pick, and they mean 'Start of game', 'middle', and 'far into game'. An example for 'Start of game' is Ghirahim, and 'middle' Imprisoned 2, and 'far into game' could be (SPOILERS!!!)Demise.
 The dragon picks the rest of the bosses. Your hearts and shield durability carry over to the next fight, to make it harder. You can always replenish your hearts by finding stray hearts in jars and other objects in the arenas.
 This may take awhile, especially the harder bosses. If it is your first time reliving the fight, you get fifty rupees when you win.
 But then you would have to do all the fights all over again. Save the rewards for next time.
 (DUN DUN DUN DUN!) Just remember to save before you quit.

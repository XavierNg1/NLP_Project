 You may have many of these supplies already on hand, but anything you're missing can be found at your local hardware store or in the home improvement section of a general retailer. This technique works best with dark colors, like green, brown, and so on. You'll need:


Drop cloth
Dust mask
Hairdryer (that has a "cool" setting)
Paintbrush
Paper towel (or clean rags)
Rubber gloves
Safety glasses (or goggles)
Sponge
Stain (walnut colored), But before you do, check your wood staining's label instructions. Always wear gloves, a dust mask, and protective eye wear, like safety glasses or goggles when working with staining.You may also have to mix the staining before using it. Then, take your paint brush and liberally coat the entire surface of your wicker furniture.


Apply your staining in a similar fashion as you would normal liquid primer or paint. Start from the top of the furniture and work your way to its bottom.
Use long, regular, overlapping strokes when applying your staining. This will help you prevent missed spots, and will promote a smooth application.
 Use your brush and paper towel or a clean rag to smooth out any drips, runs, or uneven spots in your staining. Pay close attention to cracks, crevices, and corners, as these are common trouble spots.
 The crevices formed by the weavings of the wicker can result in those nooks and crannies drying slower than others. Set your hairdryer to the "cool" setting, plug it in, and use it to blow air into crevices.


While blow drying, the force from the air may cause staining that is still wet to puddle unevenly on the furniture. Use your brush and a paper towel or clean rag to smooth these areas.
When the nooks and crannies of your wicker furniture begin to look dry, switch off your hair dryer and allow the furniture to dry overnight.

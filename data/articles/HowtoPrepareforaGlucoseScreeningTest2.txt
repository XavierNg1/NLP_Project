 The fasting plasma blood test is used to measure blood sugar levels to diagnose diabetes or pre-diabetes. A fasting plasma glucose test is normally performed in the morning, after the patient has gone approximately 12 hours without eating or drinking. Fasting is required because:A person without diabetes produces insulin in response to increased glucose levels. After an overnight fast, the blood sugar levels would be low.
A person with diabetes won’t produce insulin, leaving their glucose levels still high after an overnight fast., If you have fasted overnight, go to the testing center in the morning.


Remember to bring the form your doctor gave you that details what test should be conducted.
If the laboratory takes appointments, you may want to make one to reduce the time you need to wait in line.
Also, check your insurance and use a laboratory that is the primary provider for your health insurance.
 In order to measure the fasting plasma glucose level, you need to give a blood sample. During the blood sample:A needle will be inserted into a vein in your arm.
Blood is drawn into a test tube.
Once the test is done, you can go home and the blood sample is sent to a laboratory for testing.
 Your test is considered normal (non-diabetic) if your glucose level is below 100 mg/dl.A test result of 100–125 mg/dl is considered to be in the prediabetic stage and you are at a higher risk of developing diabetes.
A test result of 126 mg/dl or higher is considered diabetic.
If your results are positive for diabetes, your doctor will initiate a treatment plan for you to begin.
 You should be aware that the effectiveness of this test may be limited, including:Falsely low plasma glucose levels may result if blood is drawn in the afternoon instead of in the morning or if too much time passes between when the blood is drawn and when the lab processes the blood sample.
Results can also be affected by medical conditions, smoking, and exercise.

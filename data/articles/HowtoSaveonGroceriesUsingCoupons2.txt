 You can also clip out all the coupons you run across or save entire inserts, but both options will take up more time later on. Sort through your inserts and only cut out the coupons you can imagine yourself using. That way, you have less to sort through before you go shopping.
 A coupon binder is a small plastic envelop with built-in dividers that sort your coupons alphabetically. These binders are compact and easy to carry.
 You might be able to locate a specific box meant for coupon storage, or you can use a 4-inch by 6-inch file box or recycled shoebox. These are good options for individuals who plan on clipping many coupons, but not necessarily meant for those who want to carry their entire coupon collection to the store.
 Sandwich bags are clear, making it easy for you to see what you have inside. Moreover, you can label each bag with marker and store the bags away in boxes, drawers, or piles.
 If you have a box or envelop that does not contain its own dividers, purchase dividers or make your own using cardboard. Dividers make it easier to locate specific coupons later on.
 The most common way to organize coupons is alphabetically. You may also wish to consider organizing your coupons by expiration date or by product type (Produce, Frozen Foods, Drinks, and so on).

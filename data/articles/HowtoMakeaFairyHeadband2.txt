 Check the comfort of the fit on the wearer before proceeding.
 For this project, you'll need grosgrain, sheer and tulle ribbon. Select in either the same color, varying shades of the same hue or matching colors.
 Use the grosgrain ribbon to cover the whole headband. You can either wrap it around or carefully glue a straight piece across the top and a straight piece underneath (the latter method is more fiddly).


Glue the ends in place to prevent unraveling if wrapping around.
 Glue this along the length of the headband in a sort of wave-like way, with the dips glued on and the rises sticking above the headband.
 Glue large sequins or similar bright, light objects to the rise portions of the tulle ribbon length.


Alternatively, apply glitter glue for some sparkle.
 Tie the sheer ribbon into a bow. Glue in the center of the headband.
 The headband is ready for wearing.

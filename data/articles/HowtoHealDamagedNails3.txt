The corrosive elements in cleaners can eat away at your nail beds and wearing gloves prevents any possible damage., The chemicals in many antibacterial sprays, furniture polishes, and cleaning wipes can irritate your skin and nails. When shopping for cleaning products, choose natural or non-irritating formulas. Avoid products with ammonia, hydrochloric acid, sodium hypochlorite, or lye., If you find yourself biting or tearing at your nails, then this is a likely cause of at least some of the damage. Make a decision to end these behaviors and follow through by coating your nails in an unpleasant taste, such as lemon juice.

If you feel as if your nail biting is crossing the line into a compulsion, talk with a mental health professional.

 The Pillow Room is a good choice, as is going to the den of a player who is running an adoption center.
 This may be an arctic wolf, a seal, a snow leopard, a bunny, etc. State whether you are a teenager, toddler, or a baby; sometimes you are even a pet.
 Choose patterns that make you look cute and cuddly. Try not to go for the darker colors, as this will make parents think you are a bad sort of child and they won't want to adopt you.


Member girls: Designer skirt, and if you can't, get a tutu, a bonnet or, a tiara if you can't get a bonnet.
Member boys: Raccoon/fox hat, elf leg armor, and if your parents accept it, a sword.
Non-member girls: Tiara and clover blanket.
Non-member boys: Bow & Arrows or a pirate sword (if your parent accepts), raccoon hat, or a fox hat.

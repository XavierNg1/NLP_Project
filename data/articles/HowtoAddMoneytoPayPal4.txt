 You may be helping out a friend financially, helping finance someone's creative project, or paying someone for a product or service you received.
 Before you can send money through your bank account, you’ll need to have a bank account linked and confirmed with PayPal. If you don't already have a bank account linked, follow the steps listed earlier to verify your bank account.
 Log in to your PayPal account and click the "Send & Request" tab. To pay for something you’ve purchased, click “Pay for goods and services.” To send money to another PayPal account, click “Send money to friends and family.”


Enter the email address or mobile phone number of the account to which you’d like to transfer money, then click “Next.”
Type the amount you would like to send, then click “Continue” to verify.
The money may take a few days to process, depending on whether there are any existing holds or limits on the recipient's account.
 If you haven't received a payment for a good or service, you can request money via PayPal. The request money feature can also be used if you're trying to fund a project and want to send requests to friends and family members.


Click the “Send & Request” tab, then click “Request Money.”
Enter the recipient's email address and the amount you're requesting. The recipient will receive and email stating you requesting money that includes instructions on how to pay you using PayPal.
 When another person pays you for goods or services through PayPal, you will receive an email from PayPal.


To transfer money from your balance into your linked bank account, click “PayPal” balance on the left side of the screen and select “Transfer to your bank.” Type the amount of your transfer, select your linked bank from the dropdown, then click “Continue.”
To receive a check, follow the “Transfer to your bank” link, then click the link at the bottom of the screen that says “Request a check by mail instead.” Type the amount, select an address, and click “Continue” to confirm. Note that PayPal does charge $1.50 per check.

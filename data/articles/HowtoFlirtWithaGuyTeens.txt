 Try sparking up conversation or getting yourself noticed in some fun, adventurous way.;
, Just don't make him mad or hurt his feelings. Try giving him a nickname and see how he reacts when you call him it. If he seems to take offense to the nickname you gave him, apologize.
 Be interested in what he has to say. Make eye contact when he talks to you and nod every once in a while to show him that you are listening to every word he says. No matter how much your mind wants to wander away from the conversation, respond to his questions and don't let the conversation stop and/or get boring. Be fun and spontaneous with your words and keep him guessing at what you're going to say next.
 Try commenting on his posts/pictures, liking things that he has liked, poking him and friending him if you haven't already. When you've friended him, try to chat with him on Facebook.
 Scientists have shown that guys are instinctively attracted to red. Of course if he doesn't like the colour red, skip this step.
 You don't want it to be too strong, just a scent that is fun and flirty. Try spritzing some perfume on the back of your neck. Vanilla is a scent most guys are attracted to.
 Paint your nails a flirty color such as pink. You could also try wearing a sparkly nail polish. Just don't paint your nails too dark and/or sparkly.
 Flutter them slightly when you look at him or give him a soft loving look.
 Just make sure that he knows that you are only giving him a hard time as a joke.
 Is he relaxed? Is he tense? Does he look uncomfortable? If his body language is saying that he is calm and happy around you, then good job; you are doing something right! If not, adjust your body language to look more approachable and maybe flirt in a different way.
 Don't be someone you're not. Guys don't like that. Besides, shouldn't you be that way to benefit you, not just someone else?

 A wholesale dealership can be run entirely from your home. However, if you don’t have space for an office in your home you’ll need to lease or purchase a space.
 Remember, it’s OK for it to be a home office.You don’t need a sign or space for a car to be a wholesale dealer., You’ll need a copy of your lease if you rent your office. If you own your office, a copy of your mortgage is required.

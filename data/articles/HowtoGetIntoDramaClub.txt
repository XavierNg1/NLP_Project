 When it's the day to audition for drama club, don't be afraid! Have confidence in yourself. Even if you are upset because you didn't make it last year, just remember - you have experience before trying out this time.;
, When it's not your turn to audition, flash at the director. If you're going to be in the drama club, you're going to need to be comfortable on the stage. Smiling and speaking loudly are both ways to show that you are likely to not have a panic attack during a performance, which is something that most directors prefer to occur.
 When you audition, try to move around a little bit. No matter how tiny the area that you are given to work with is, you always look better if you can demonstrate some basic knowledge of blocking (a stage term for where you stand/move).
 Stepping inside another person's skill is an absolute requirement when performing drama. Think to yourself:


How would ____ (the character you are auditioning for) talk?
How would he/she move?
How would he/she react to things?


Don't overdo it. The person you are still needs to shine forth; switch back to your real self in the blink of an eye when needed, showing that you're not lost in the character. Actors who lack this ability during the early stages of training can be a warning sign to a judge, who may be concerned that you'll be difficult to work with or lost in daydreams.
 When you are finished, stand up smiling; the director will eventually give you further instructions.

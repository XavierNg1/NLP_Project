 To date there is no known cure for Stiff Skin Syndrome, and instead patients must try and manage their symptoms. One of the most effective management strategies is physiotherapy. Because Stiff Skin Syndrome inhibits joint mobility, physiotherapy is used to help maintain or even improve joint movement.Physiotherapists will work on providing patients with a variety of stretches and strength exercises that will target the region of the body that is most impacted by the disease.
 Depending on the severity of the disease, your child may have severe mobility issue. If this is the case, you can purchase a walking aid such as a cane to help with their mobility. In some cases joints may become so stiff that walking is no longer possible. Use a wheelchair to help with mobility.


Look into government funding options for expensive aids, such as wheelchairs.
 There are numerous support groups available for patients and family members to meet other people experiencing the same rare disease. These groups allow individuals to share their stories and experiences. Many of these groups also engage in awareness-raising activities, and gather information for patients.Try contacting one of these foundations to find a support group: Childrenâ€™s Skin Disease Foundation, National Marfan Foundation, Scleroderma Research Foundation.
 Stiff Skin Syndrome is a very rare disease and doctors are still trying to find ways to manage and cure the disease. As a result, there may be opportunities to participate in clinical trials. Check the website clinicaltrials.gov to learn more about participating in a clinical trial.Talk with your doctor about joining a clinical trial.

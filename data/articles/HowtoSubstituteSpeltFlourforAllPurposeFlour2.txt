 When you’re beginning to experiment with spelt flour substitution, it’s best to ease your way into it. Replace just ¼ of the all-purpose flour in your recipe with spelt and use all-purpose flour for the remaining ¾ to see how the finished product turns out. You can gradually begin to increase the amount of spelt when you know how it will affect the recipe.If you’re only using ¼ spelt flour for a recipe, you don’t necessarily have to reduce the amount of liquid. See how the final product turns out before deciding if you have to adjust the liquids.
 For pancakes, you can make a 1 for 1 substitution with spelt and all-purpose flour. The spelt will give the pancakes a rich, sweet whole wheat flavor, while still creating a moist, fluffy texture.If you’re doing a 1 for 1 substitution with spelt in your pancakes, be sure to reduce the liquids by ¼.
 With baked goods like cookies, muffins, or sweetbreads, having a moist, soft texture is important. Instead of using a 1 for 1 substitution with spelt and all-purpose flour, you’re better off using half spelt and half all-purpose. That will keep them from being too crumbly.It usually isn't necessary to reduce the liquid in a recipe if you're using half spelt and half all-purpose flour.
 If you’re making a delicious yeast bread, using all spelt flour in place of all-purpose can lead to dry bread that has a pronounced whole wheat flavor. Using half spelt flour instead keeps the bread moist and provides a sweet, mild flavor.You don't have to reduce the liquid if you're only using 50% spelt flour in your yeast bread recipe.

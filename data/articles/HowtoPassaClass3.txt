 If your teacher offers office hours outside of class (i.e. for a college course), attend them regularly. This is a good chance to get some extra help and one-on-one attention from your teacher.When you go to office hours, come with specific questions or topics you want to discuss or review. This will help you get focused attention where you most need it. Furthermore, most teachers don't appreciate it when students come to office hours with no idea what they want to cover.
Do not just bring your homework or study guide to office hours and ask the instructor to fill it out for you. Teachers find this very frustrating.
 Find out if other students in your class are studying together. If so, ask if you can join one of these groups.


Study groups allow students to pool their knowledge and understanding of the course, sharing information with each other and creating a regular study schedule.Ask people you know in the course if they are studying with other people. If you can't find a study group, you might try to start one yourself by asking other students if they'd be interested in participating in one.
 If you are really struggling, you may need to seek additional help with a course in the form of tutoring. A tutor can help you by clarifying concepts and reviewing information with you in a structured way.


Many schools offer free tutoring services to students in the form of writing or tutoring centers. There is usually no additional cost for using these services.Find out if your school has such a program, and when it's open. You may need to make an appointment, so find out about that, too.
If you have the money, you can also hire a private tutor to work with you. You can either hire an individual tutor or enlist the services of a tutoring business. Look online and on bulletin boards around your school to find out what services may be offered near you. Your school's website may even have listings for tutors available to help in different subject areas.

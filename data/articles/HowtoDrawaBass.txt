 Draw two ovals (one much larger than the other) as shown and add guidelines for features.
 Also draw a circle for the eyes and add lines for gills. Add scales if you'd like to make your fish look more realistic., These should be small in comparison to the body of the bass, but don't worry--just add as much detail as you can and make sure they're shaped correctly., It should be connected to the smaller oval from step 1. In the next step you will outline it to make it look like an actual tail., Make sure to sketch a smooth juncture from the lower body to the tail fin. Give your bass more scales if you want, and then color it in in dark tones like chartreuse.

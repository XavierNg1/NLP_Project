 Combine hot - not warm - water and soap in a small bowl and place sapphires in the bowl to soak anywhere from 10-20 minutes. Soaking the gemstones will help loosen the more persistent dirt or smudges that have built up.The main difference in the two cleaning styles is the amount of time you let the sapphire soak. The dirtier the sapphire, the longer you'll want to let it soak, which is ultimately aimed at reducing the amount of scrubbing you'll have to do.
 Use a soft-bristled toothbrush, make-up brush or jewelry rag to scrub the sapphire. Rinse the sapphire under warm tap water to clear away dirt and then gently scrub away any remaining residue.
 Use a dry jewelry cloth to thoroughly dry the sapphire before storing as to eliminate the possibility of leaving water marks. Store sapphires in a dry place to ensure cleanliness is retained.

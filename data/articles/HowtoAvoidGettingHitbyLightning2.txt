 Lightning rods do not attract lightning but do provide a path of least resistance if lightning hits your house. This can prevent the electric current from damaging your home. Do not install a lightning rod yourself: find an electrician certified to install lightning systems., During thunderstorms, lightning can travel through water pipes if it strikes your home. Do not bathe or shower until the storm has passed. If you have to use the sink, only do so in emergencies.Even showers or bathtubs that are completely enclosed without windows nearby put you at-risk for electrocution because of the water pipes.
Avoid areas with standing water or excessive moisture during storms, like a cellar basement or patio slab.Because porcelain is a great insulator, toilets are safe to use during lightning storms so long as you aren't touching metal., Using electronic devices that plug into the wall is dangerous during a lightning storm. Avoid using TVs, washing machines, and corded phones during thunderstorms. Wireless electronics, like cell phones, are safe to use unless they are plugged into a charger.Unplug electronic objects during a thunderstorm in case lightning strikes the house and the surge short circuits them., Avoid standing next to open windows or doors during a thunderstorm. Although rare, lightning can travel through windows during storms. Glass is a good insulator, so it is unlikely that the window will be struck if closed.

Do not touch doorknobs during a storm, as metal conducts electricity.

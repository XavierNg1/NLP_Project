 Many people use text messaging as a primary source of communication. However, this is not the best way to keep the passion and intimacy strong in your relationship. Choose a few times throughout the week to get together and video chat.Video chatting allows you both to see each other’s face, which is important when trying to maintain passion.
During video chat, you can have a smooth, immediate conversation, which you can’t do on text. Video chat allows you to watch each other’s facial expressions, unlike talking on the phone.
 Being unable to have regular date night can be tough when you’re in a long distance relationship. To help, go on a movie date together. Choose a favorite movie or a movie you’ve both never seen. Curl up on the couch and watch the movie together.You can do this while talking on the phone, texting, or video chatting. You can pause the movie to discuss it, or exchange little comments throughout the movie.
Make sure to choose a time where you both will have time to watch the movie and won’t be disturbed by others.
 Just because you are far apart doesn’t mean you still can’t do the same things you usually do. Technology allows you to do almost anything you’d normally do when apart. Set up video chat, cook a meal together, and then sit down to eat it together.You can also get take out from the same type of restaurant and eat together as you catch up.
 You probably already schedule as many visits to see each other as possible. Consider making a surprise visit to give you both an unexpected, spontaneous romantic surprise. Schedule the visit at a time you know your partner won’t have something pressing to do.You may casually ask your partner what their week looks like to make sure there are no meetings, big projects, or other commitments you’ll interfere with.
Think about letting them know about the surprise a few days ahead of time. This helps it stay a surprise, but allows your partner time to make arrangements.

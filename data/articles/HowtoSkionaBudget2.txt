 You are most likely to find a better deal at a nearby hotel than a resort when you’re near a town. Budget accommodations, including motel chains and hostels, won’t offer many features. Many of them may not even offer breakfast. However, these are perfect for staying the night before heading out to the slopes.Search for places near the resort area or town and compare prices according to the features you need.
Self-catering apartments are a growing trend in Europe, but there are still small, cheap examples of these to rent. Search online for listings near the resort.
 If you choose a resort that’s near a town, you will have more food, hotel, and transportation options. In addition, some cities are near multiple resorts. This way, you aren’t stuck relying upon expensive resort accommodations.For example, Salt Lake City is near several Utah resorts and Vallandry is near Les Arcs in France.
Flying into a big city cuts down on ticket costs and transportation time to the resort.
 Getting yourself to and from the resort adds up. Fortunately, many resorts are serviced by transportation options that save you from spending on gas. Many resorts, such as those in Salt Lake City and Colorado, are serviced by airport shuttles, trains, or buses.Choosing a resort town also helps cut down on expense, as you can walk or take a bus around the town instead of driving.
 If you need more freedom than public transportation offers or need to get to a more distant resort, try to get a car that’s smaller and lighter on gas. Cars are good for families and groups that share costs. Compare prices online for airport and nearby independent car rental companies if you can’t drive from home.

 A well is drilled vertically into the ground until it reaches the permeable shale layers.

Once the digging has hit the gas rich layers, redirect it horizontally into the rock layers. The digging is now parallel to the ground above, but at an immense depth below the surface (anywhere around 7,000 to 12,000 feet). The well is surrounded by a protective steel casing, and it is surrounded by both steel and concrete when it is drilled past the underground aquifer level.
Within the shale are small holes and fissures wherein the natural gases lie. These cracks are going to need to be expanded via pressure.;
, Feed high pressured water into the well via a pumping tank.

The high pressure and intensity of the water rushes into the shale layers, cracks, and crevices.
Floating throughout the water are high pressured sand particles or artificial proppants. Because of the high pressure of the water during hydraulic fracturing, the proppants are forced into the cracks and crevices of the shale rock.
 The internal pressure of the shale rock causes the water to make its way back to the surface.

Collect the used water in a designated tank, where it will later be transferred to a treatment plant.
As the water retreats, the cracks and crevices of the shale rock will attempt to close because it does not have the water pressure holding open the cracks anymore.
 Leave the proppants behind in the cracks and fractures after the water has retreated. As the name implies, the proppants “prop” open the shale fractures, keeping them from closing off again.

Because of the immense pressure of the surrounding shale rock, fracturing proppants must be extremely strong and have a high crush factor.
 The once trapped shale gas is now able to flow free from the shale layers because it has remained propped open by high crush factor proppants.

The shale flows out from the fissures and into the well.
 From the well, the natural gas is transferred to nearby storage tanks until it is piped to market.

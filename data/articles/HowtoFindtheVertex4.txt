 Your current quadratic equation will need to be rewritten into this form, and in order to do that, you'll need to complete the square.


Example: y = -x^2 - 8x - 15

, Factor out the coefficient of the first term, a from the first two terms in the equation. Leave the final term, c, alone for now.


Example: -1 (x^2 + 8x) - 15

, The third term must complete the set in the parentheses so that the values in parentheses form a perfect square. This new term is the squared value of half the coefficient of the middle term.


Example: 8 / 2 = 4; 4 * 4 = 16; therefore,

-1(x^2 + 8x + 16)
Also keep in mind that what you do to the inside must also be done to the outside:
y = -1(x^2 + 8x + 16) - 15 + 16



, Since your parentheses now form a perfect square, you can simplify the parenthetical portion to its factored form. Simultaneously, you can do any addition or subtraction needed to the values outside of the parentheses.


Example: y = -1(x + 4)^2 + 1

, Recall that the vertex form of an equation is y = a(x - h)^2 + k, with (h, k) representing the coordinates of the vertex. You now have enough information to plug values into the h and k slots and complete the problem.


k = 1
h = -4
Therefore, the vertex of this equation can be found at: (-4, 1)

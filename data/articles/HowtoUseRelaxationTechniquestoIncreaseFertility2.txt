 There is nothing like being around people who love and support you. If you clear some of your schedule and make room for just spending time with these people, chances are you will automatically become a happier person. Social interaction is important and can do wonders for elevating your overall mood and decreasing stress.


Being with your family and friends can give you great opportunities for good fits of laughter. In terms of stress, it’s true that laughter can be the best medicine and a great stress reliever. You can also find laughter in a funny television show or movie. Getting your daily laughter in can definitely put you in a better mood and can be a great stress reliever.
 If you don’t have a pet, consider getting one. Pets can be your best friends and will always be there to offer you a friendly smile when you get home. Research shows that pets have been proven to extend people’s lives and to be great companions. Try spending more time walking and playing with your pet on a daily basis and you will likely experience a decrease in stress. This can be one of the easiest and most fun ways to help you de-stress.

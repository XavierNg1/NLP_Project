, You can plug it into any USB port located either at the back of a desktop CPU or along the sides of a laptop.
 Click on the shortcut icon on the desktop, or select it from the list of programs installed on your computer.
 Once you’ve launched iTunes, it will automatically sync your device with your computer. On the iPad Mini screen, you’ll see the word “Syncing.”


When your iPad Mini syncs with your computer, iTunes recopies all the video and picture contents from your computer to your iPad Mini, even if it was deleted on the device.
As long as you have a copy of the picture saved on your computer, you can recover that picture anytime it gets deleted from your iPad Mini.
 Once iTunes finishes syncing your iPad Mini, eject it by clicking the up arrow beside its name on the left menu panel of iTunes.


The pictures should now be available again on your iPad Mini.

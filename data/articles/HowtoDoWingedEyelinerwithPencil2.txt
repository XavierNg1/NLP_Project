 Drawing dots along the corners of your eyes can help guide you as you make your wings. Draw three dots that extent upward. Remember, your wing should stretch out no farther than the tip of your eyebrow.








Draw one dot right next to the outer corner of your eye.
Move your pencil upward and draw a third dot rest in the crease created by your eyelid.
Draw a third dot that's parallel to the end of your eyebrow. It should be near your brow bone.
 Take your brush and draw a line stretching through the dots. The line should start at the end of the eyeliner you applied to your lash line and end at the third dot. Go slowly to avoid smudging your eyeliner. When you're done, you should have a small line stretching out of the corners of your eyes.
 Draw another line from the third dot to around the middle part of your lash line. The line should slant into your lash-line, creating a triangle shape.
 Take your pencil and color in the triangle you created. When you're done, you should have a wing extending from the corner of your eye. Repeat with the other eye to complete your look.

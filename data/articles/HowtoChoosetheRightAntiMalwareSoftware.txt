 This is the most important thing you need, and has probably the most options.


In terms of free software, many sources recommend one of the following: (choose one)

avast! Home Edition
Avira Free Antivirus
Panda Cloud Antivirus
AVG AntiVirus Free
Immunet Free Antivirus


Avast! is lightest on system resources, while Avira Antivir has the highest detection rates. Avira AntiVir pops up an ad after updating, but there are ways to remove it.
If you insist on paying, F-Secure Antivirus, Kaspersky Anti-Virus, and Bitdefender Antivirus Plus are all viable options that balance detection ratesand system resource usage.;
, While antivirus software will also remove spyware and/or adware, an antispyware/adware product is recommended for on-demand scanning. The following are good options (choose at least one).



MalwareBytes Anti-Malware if you get the premium version you will have great realtime malware and virus protection so there is no need to run a separate antivirus program. Running multiple AV programs slows down your computer and drains your devices battery quicker
SUPERAntiSpyware
AdwCleaner has the best detection rate in my personal experience

, While many people stick with the Windows Firewall that comes with Windows, that one isn't very good at blocking malware that is already on your computer from calling home.



ZoneAlarm Firewall is probably the most popular.
The Sygate Firewall used to be one of the best, but is no longer free, so Comodo Firewall seems to be the best choice. It can be intrusive, so make sure to use the 'Scan for Known Applications' feature.

Sunbelt-Kerio Personal Firewall is also a good choice.
If money is not a problem for you, feel free to download the paid version of these products or Norton Internet Security which includes the Sygate Firewall.
Make sure to disable the Windows Firewall if using a separate one.
 While Internet Explorer 6 comes with many computers, it is the least safe browser to use!


If you don't feel comfortable using other programs (Internet Explorer is the most simple), then at least upgrade to the newest version.
The most popular secure browsers are Firefox (known for its customizability), Opera (prepackaged with several features and good for slow connections), and Google Chrome (very light out of the box).

 Use #2 2-by-4 wood beams. Use a circular saw to cut the beams so they are large enough in width and length to fit your particular tank. Add .5 inch (1.3 cm) to ensure the tank does not slip off once placed. Hammer the beams together with wood finishing nails.;
, Space the beams at 2-foot (.6 m) intervals. These help distribute and hold the weight of the tank and water. Cut the beams to fit the rectangular frame, and hammer them together with more finishing nails.
 Also use #2 2-by-4 wood beams, cut them to your specifications, and secure them to the frame with finishing nails.
 For optimal results, use 8-by-12 wood screws. You may also use wood glue to cement the joint pieces to the frame.
 Trace the exact shape and measurement with your pencil onto a piece of 4-by-8 wood sheeting, and use a jigsaw to cut out the shape. Install the panel in the bottom of the frame, and secure it with wood glue. You may also opt to use finishing nails to complete the installation.

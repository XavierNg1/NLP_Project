 Decide on at least four different colors of embroidery floss. These should be left in their original six-strand form and cut to about 24 inches (61.0 cm) long each.
 Tie all your strings in a small knot at the very end. Then, braid them for about three inches and tie them in a second knot. You have just created one of the ends that will be tied around your wrist. Tape or pin this knot to a tabletop or your pant leg.
 Lay your strings out flat, leaving a bit of space between each piece. Start on the left side and tie basic knots across each string by laying your first string in an “L” shape over the string directly to the right. This should create a “4” shape. Take the end of this string and loop it underneath the string to the right, pulling the end through the center. This should create a loop around the 2nd string, which you should pull taut to the top of the strings. Repeat steps to finish the knot.
 Using the same string that you started with, work your way to the right side of the strings by tying knots around each of the adjacent threads. When you get to the right side (after tying knots over all the strings), let the thread go and start again on the left side. Continue the same pattern you started by starting with the 2nd thread, working until you get to the right side. Eventually you will work your way across all the strings with all four of your threads, and start the pattern over again with the original 1st thread. Make sure to keep pulling the threads taut to the top of the bracelet, so that your finished product is sleek, smooth, and flat.
 Stop your weaving pattern of the bracelet when the the striped section is long enough to wrap around your wrist. Tie a knot at the end, and then braid a 3” section of string past the knot. Knot the end of this braid to create the second tie for your bracelet.
 Tie the bracelet around your wrist and show it off.

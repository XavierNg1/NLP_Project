 Locate a workspace that you donâ€™t mind potentially scratching the surface. Alternatively, you can lie down a protective surface to on your flat workspace.


This could be something like a hard book, or a plastic place mat.
 Insert the sharp point of the screwdriver through the middle portion of the knot.Press the screwdriver onto your work surface so it is completely touching the work surface. Wiggle the screwdriver back and forth until the necklace begins to loosen around the knot.This same method can be used with practically any small, thin object (pin, needle, tack, etc.).
 Once the knot has loosened, you can use the screwdriver and your fingers to begin pulling apart and separating the individual sections of the knot.

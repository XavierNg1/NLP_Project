 Position it so it can be attached to the axle of the polyethelene roller.


The motor can be powered by AC current or batteries. It can be connected directly to the axle (direct drive) or connected by a belt. Motors can be salvaged from other devices, like sewing machines. You can also purchase motors at an electronic supply store.
If you don't want to use a motor you can use a hand crank attached to the roller instead.

 If you are alone and the group consists of 4-5 (rifled or stronger) individuals, you may want to leave them alone and run away. and check for more inexperienced signs, for example, if you are in a courtyard , and they run out blindly, they are most likely new and are sniper bait.;
, If they haven't seen you, they aren't looking for you. However, be wary that even if they are not searching for you, they still will be on their toes, so don't be surprised to walk into a barrage of fire when you walk out to take that shot. common signs of them seeing you are more packed formations, and them looking everywhere quickly.
 And always get to know a map before playing as some maps have passages that look like they may surround them, but instead empty out right into their crosshairs.
, I dunno how many times I can say this, I know it's tempting to go back and get your kill count up, but as you realize, now they are ready for you, and waiting or sending search parties.
 There is safety in numbers.

 If you're buying a room air conditioner, you only need to figure the room whose window the air conditioner will be installed in; if you're buying a central air conditioner or heat pump, you need to figure the entire square footage of the house served by ductwork, as described under "Determining How Much to Heat or Cool."

, One method for determining capacity is refer to the estimates on this index.Note that air conditioners are rated in BTUs per hour, but the label may abbreviate this to just "BTU."


To cool 100–150 ft2, you need ~5,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 150–250 ft2, you need ~6,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 250–300 ft2, you need ~7,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 300–350 ft2, you need ~8,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 350–400 ft2, you need ~9,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 400–450 ft2, you need ~10,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 450–550 ft2, you need ~12,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 550–700 ft2, you need ~14,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 700–1,000 ft2, you need ~18,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 1,000–1,200 ft2, you need ~21,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 1,200–1,400 ft2, you need ~23,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 1,400–1,500 ft2, you need ~24,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 1,500–2,000 ft2, you need ~30,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 2,000–2,500 ft2, you need ~34,000 BTUs per hour.
 If you're buying a room air conditioner instead of a central unit, you can adjust your needs according to the following factors:


Reduce the necessary capacity by 10 percent if the room to be cooled is heavily shaded. However, if the room is very sunny, increase the necessary capacity by 10 percent.
If the room regularly hosts more than 2 people, add 600 BTUs/hour for each person after the second.
If the room to be cooled is a kitchen, increase the necessary capacity by 4,000 BTUs/hour.
 While furnaces are rated by their effectiveness in delivering the heat they generate, air conditioners are rated by how efficiently they use electricity over the course of a typical operating year. One such rating is the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) rating, created by the Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, which is the ratio of the unit's cooling output in BTUs divided by the energy in watt-hours needed to run it for the entire operating year. (Note that 1 kilowatt-hour equals 1,000 watt hours.)


For example, take a 4,000 BTU/hour air conditioner run for 1,000 hours during an operating year using 400,000 watt-hours of electric power. This air conditioner would have a SEER rating of 10, since 4,000 x 1,000 / 400,000 = 10.
To find the average power consumption divide the unit's power in BTUs per hour by the SEER rating. Since the SEER rating is in units of BTU per Watt-hour, your answer will be in terms of watts. In the example above, (4,000 BTU/h) / (10 BTU/Wh) = 400 W.
To find the cost per hour of operation, multiply the average power consumption in kilowatts by the cost of your electricity per kilowatt-hour. In our example, the unit's consumption is (400 W) / (1,000 W/kW) = 0.4kW. If your electricity costs 5 cents per kWh, this unit costs 0.4kW x 5 ¢/kWh = 2 ¢/h (cents per hour).
Central air conditioners manufactured in the United States since January 2006 are required to have a SEER rating of at least 13, or 14 to be Energy Star qualified. Room air conditioners are currently exempt from this requirement; many have SEER ratings closer to 10.

 Most water aerobic moves use only the resistance of the water to give your body a good workout. For most water aerobic workouts, you'll also need a pool noodle or kick board and some light hand weights., You can work your core in the water by performing underwater lunges. You can hold light weights loosely in your hands when you perform this move to make it a little bit harder.To perform a lunge, stand in waist deep water, with your right foot forward and your thigh parallel to the pool floor. Your left knee should be slightly bent, and your hands should be at your waist. Jump up and switch feet so that your left leg is forward and your right knee is slightly bent.
 Stand with your body underwater up to your shoulders. Let your arms rest at your sides with your hands facing up. Then curl your arms up toward your shoulders in an even motion. It should feel like you're trying to scoop water up and out of the pool.To add extra resistance, you can hold a pool noodle or kick board in your hands as you perform the move. The water will push against the noodle or board, making it harder to lift.
 Being in the pool automatically adds resistance to anything youâ€™ll do with your legs. You can walk or jog the length of the pool, do jumping jacks, or kick underwater.To kick underwater, stand with your legs shoulder-width apart in waist deep water. Kick your right leg up as far as is comfortable and then lower it smoothly back down. Then repeat with the other leg.
You might want to hold on to the side of the pool to keep your balance while you're walking or jogging.

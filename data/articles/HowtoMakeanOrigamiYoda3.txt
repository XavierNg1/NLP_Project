 Fold the top of the paper down about an inch (in other words, fold it so that one inch of the green side is showing at the top of the brown side).


It's best to use origami paper that is green on one side and brown on the other. You can get this at any craft store. However, you can continue the process using any colored paper - the Yoda just might not be colored correctly. It will still have the right shape.
 You want to fold them so that their edges line up with the edge of the green line. Make a crease, then unfold them. , Using the creases you made in previously as guidelines, tuck the corners in between the two sides of the paper. This will create two flaps, which will later become the ears.
 Then, fold the bottom up one inch so that there is an inch of brown showing at the bottom of the green. , You're undoing the step where you folded the bottom up one inch. Fold it back down. The goal is to make a new crease that is different from that fold. Do not use the same crease you created the first time you folded the bottom up one inch. Create a new crease as close to the first crease as possible. This will create a zigzag shape.
 Fold the paper up so that the bottom edge almost touches the top edge. Crease well.
 Fold the paper down just above the crease left over from step 5 when you made the zigzag crease.
 Fold the left corner down and into the middle. Repeat with the right side. , Find the triangle flaps of paper in the center. Fold them so that they stick out. Turn the paper back over and then youâ€™re done! Feel free to draw on a face or round out his head if you wish.

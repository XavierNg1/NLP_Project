When you’re talking with someone and you come to an awkward lull in the conversation, ask, “Can I get you a drink?”Equip yourself for conversation by having some conversation starters ready to deploy. For instance, you might say, “So, which division of the company are you in?” Follow up by asking, “Oh, is it interesting? How long have you been there?”Locate extroverted conversation partners so that they do all the work for you.Shake hands firmly and use a bright smile when meeting new people., If you feel stifled or exhausted after too much holiday office party stimulation, head out to your car or just step outside for a minute or two. This should give you time to “recharge” for another round of holiday office party interactions., If you’re on your phone, you might come off as disinterested and miss opportunities for socialization. Put a wine glass or a plate of hors d’oeuvres in your hands instead., The best part of the holiday office party is having fun with people you only get to see on a professional basis. Have a few drinks and relax. Tell a joke to your coworker and laugh you’re your coworker shares their funny jokes.Be warm and personable at your holiday office party.

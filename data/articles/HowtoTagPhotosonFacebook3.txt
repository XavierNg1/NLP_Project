 In order to tag photos uploaded by your friends you must be logged into Facebook.


You can only tag photos that have been uploaded by people who you are friends with on Facebook.
 If the photo has recently been uploaded you can find it on your friend's Timeline.


If you can't easily find the photo on the timeline, click the Photos button to the side of the person's profile picture.
Find and select the picture you want to tag.
 Click the Tag Photo button at the top right or bottom of the photo.


Click on the face of the person you want to tag.
Type the name of the person you want to tag. Once you've started typing a list of names will appear in a dropdown menu. You can either select the name from the dropdown menu or continue typing and press enter.

, After you get enough money, start at the forward bunker (the one with the hole in the wall).
 The wise thing to do is make it a trap, as the hatch on top of the bunker can be opened by hitting it, shooting it, or the less noticeable way, throwing a bubble shield onto it. Set up a turret of your choice down the hallway by the hatch, and block off the first hallway right next to the big hole in the wall.
 Spawn a second sniper rifle, and some grenades (firebomb and frag. are best). Then, for an even better view of the beach, spawn a portal and then go on top of the roof of the tower and spawn another.
 Remember, there is a small opening on one side of the base were someone can crawl through a pipe into the base. Block the hole and they won't get in. Towards the back of the base where the ghost is, there is a catwalk. Use crates to make a wall so nobody can get in. Set up turrets in high places, be creative, set them up on the top of the control room next to the big missile launcher, and on the little spot behind the control panel for the gates.
, Line the gauss warthogs and tank, then use any barriers and pallets you have left over to put in front of the vehicles for protection.
 If the other team somehow gets in and destroys all vehicles, you need a place to regroup with your teammates and plan a counterattack. A few good places for this are inside the cave by the beach, up on the high area by the beach, in the inner part of the bunker, and if you are by yourself, in the pipe.

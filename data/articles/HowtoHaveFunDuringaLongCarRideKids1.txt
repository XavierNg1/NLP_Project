 This can work for some, as long as you don't get too carsick. If you feel carsick, stop reading. Get a active book that is full of action -- this should keep you occupied!;
, If you have an iPhone, iPad, or iPod, play games that don't require the Internet! Some good ones are Paintsparkle, talking friends apps, (some talking friends apps require money) including Tom Heart Angela, Talking Larry, (Talking Larry might require money, too), Talking Rex, Talking Lila, and Talking Hippo require money, other recommendations are the Garfield diner app, Pet Puppy, Angry Birds, Hungry Hippo, Zoom, Math Puppy.


Watch a movie or two on your digital tablet or portable DVD player.
 If you brought along some stuffed animals, play a game of show them around the outside of the car. You can also play with anything else you may have brought from home, such as dolls, barbies, etc.

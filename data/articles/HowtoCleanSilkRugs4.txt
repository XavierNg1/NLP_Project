 Silk can't be exposed to heat or chemicals, so ask how the silk rug will be cleaned. Silk rugs should be washed on both the front and back surfaces with a detergent specifically formulated for silk fibers. Most rug cleaners will offer a deep dusting, followed by pre-treatment for stain removal and hand washing of the silk rugs.

 Hold the body spray four to five inches (102 to 127 mm) from your pulse points. Spray each pulse point with one spray. Try to avoid rubbing in the spray. Instead, let the body spray soak in and dry on your skin.








Your pulse points include your wrists, the insides of your elbows, the front of your neck, the back of your knees and between your breasts.
 Do this once you have spritzed your pulse points. However, hold the spray can seven to nine inches (178 to 229 mm) from your body








Alternatively, you can spritz the air in front of you and walk through the mist to scent your clothes.
 Try to avoid spraying your hair directly. Instead, spritz the air above you once or twice with the spray. Quickly stand underneath the mist to lightly scent your hair.

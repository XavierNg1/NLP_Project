 If you plan to remove more than one drawer from a piece of furniture, you should start by removing the top drawer first. Work your way down one drawer at a time until you reach the bottom.


Removing the upper drawers before removing the lower ones can prevent the piece from becoming too top-heavy, thereby preventing it from wobbling or tipping over as you work. If the piece itself is secured or much heavier than the loaded drawers, however, there is no danger of tipping and the order of removal won't matter.;
, Pull the drawer out as far as it will go without offering any resistance. Most drawers will reach a natural stopping point.


Stand in front of the piece of furniture and position one hand on either side of the drawer. Keep a little space in between you and the drawer so that there's enough room for the drawer to extend out., Angle the front of the drawer downward, carefully lifting the back end up in the process. You should feel the wheels or back edge lift away from the track.


You may need to gently yet firmly tug or wiggle the drawer forward to help free the wheels from the interior track. Do not apply too much pressure, however, since doing so could damage the drawer or attached hardware.
 Continue pulling the drawer straight out. Now that the wheels are beyond the stopping mechanism, you should be able to completely remove the drawer from the piece of furniture.

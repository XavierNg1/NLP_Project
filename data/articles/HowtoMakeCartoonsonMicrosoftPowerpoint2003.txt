, Adventure? Comedy? When you know what you want to do, give your cartoon a name. Type the title in the corresponding box or insert a WordArt shape that states it. Put some credit in the subtitle box (ex. By ___________).
 An actual drawing would take weeks on the computer, especially on Powerpoint! To make a stick figure, use a circle for a head, 1 long line for the back, two lines coming from under the head to serve as his arms, and 2 lines from the bottom of the figures back to serve as his legs. Click and hold the left mouse button and drag a box around the entire figure. Without clicking anywhere else, right click on the figures head and go to the Grouping tab. Select "Group". The parts will band together and form a figure.
 Click your character, then click on the "Add Effect" button. From there, click Entrance. After that, click "view more" on the bottom.


At this page, you have many different entrances at your disposal. Pick one. It should show your character entering. Use this same process for exiting, except click "Exits" at the effect screen.
, After that, experiment!

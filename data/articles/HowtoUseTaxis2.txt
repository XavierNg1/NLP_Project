 Ask your driver about what their food and drink policies are. If they have a no eating or drinking policy, adhere to their rules. Some taxi drivers prefer to have a strict policy to prevent spills. Alcohol is a big "no-no," as passengers drinking from open alcohol containers is illegal in many areas .Do not bring and pungent foods with you into the taxi, as smells tend to linger in cars.
Clean up after yourself before you exit the cab, and take any wrappers or trash with you.
 When traveling in a group, don't ask the cabbie to accommodate more than three people. Every passenger must have a seat belt. Cramming more people than the taxi has room for can get your driver in trouble. Split into several groups if you have four or more people., If your driver tries to make conversation, be kind and agreeable. Let them know if you're tired or don't feel like talking. In most cases, your driver will accommodate and give you space. Do not insult the taxi driver if traffic puts you behind schedule, and avoid disruptive behavior like yelling, insensitive comments, or vulgar jokes.

Never ask your taxi driver to speed or break the law in any way. Driving safely is an important component of their job, and driving recklessly puts their employment status at-risk., Beyond the overall fare, tipping a cabbie is polite. 20 percent is standard in most areas, but feel free to give more if your driver was especially helpful. Late at night is a common time for passengers to forget, so pay extra attention to tipping if you hailed a taxi at night.

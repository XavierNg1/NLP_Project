 Hot water makes bleach more effective, though it can also cause chlorine bleach to release more chlorine fumes. So only use hot water with bleach in the washing machine, where the fumes will be contained., If your washer has a special bleach dispenser, you can put everything in at once. Pour detergent into the drum or its own dispenser, place laundry in the drum, and pour bleach into its dispenser. Follow the instructions on your machine regarding amounts, but typically you can use ½ cup (120 mL) of bleach for a full-sized load. Turn on the washer and let it run normally., Add however much detergent you need for the size of the load you’re doing and turn on the water. Let the water agitate the detergent for 5 minutes., Follow the directions on your machine for how and when to add bleach. But if you’re unsure, it’s best to wait 5 minutes to add the bleach. Detergents have special enzymes that can be deactivated by bleach if the two liquids are mixed together. Waiting 5 minutes allows the enzymes to dissolve in the water first.Use about ½ cup (120 mL) of bleach for a full-sized load.
If there are any items with color in this load, use only non-chlorine bleach.
 Once the water has detergent and bleach fully mixed in, add the items you want to wash. Waiting to add them until now helps you dilute the bleach first so that none of your garments get heavy doses of bleach., When the cycle is done, your clothes should be clean and stain-free. You may need to repeat this process for items with really tough stains.

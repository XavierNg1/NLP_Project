 If you are a member, you have an endless variety of places to rob. It can range anywhere from Lumbridge Castle to Ardougne market.;
, Things to wear should be something along the lines of your in-game armour or priest robes with the Grim Reaper Hood (see the Tips section for more clothing ideas).
 The more people, the more realistic the robbery will "feel".
 Before you start the robbery, take attendance by having everyone helping you out enter your clan chat.
 This is where the fun begins. Make sure you have everything ready.
 This is done by saying/doing the right things like:


"Everyone drop to the floor right now!"
"Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt!"
"What did I say? I said, 'Don't move!'"
*Shoots uncooperative persons with crossbow*

, The robbery should last for a minimum of 5 minutes, no longer than 15 minutes. A robbery over 15 minutes indicates that you want to turn this into a hostage situation.

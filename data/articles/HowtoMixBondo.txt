 Alternatively, you can mix it on particle board or buy an inexpensive pad of disposable plastic sheets to mix the Bondo.;
, Use the stir stick to lift a golf ball-sized dollop of filler out of the can and reseal the can.


Mix a larger amount of Bondo and hardener if the area you need to patch is larger. Look at your project to estimate the amount of Bondo needed.
 (Bondo comes with a tube of hardener.)


If you add too much hardener, the mixture will gel too quickly. If you add too little, it increases the amount of time for it to cure, and if you don't add enough it will never cure. If you add 1 line of hardener across the top of the dollop of Bondo, it takes about 15 minutes to dry after applying. Add 2 lines and it takes about 5 minutes to dry. Experiment to get the right Bondo mixture.
 Do not whip them, but rather fold them to avoid introducing air bubbles.


Use hardener with dye in it so you can see when the mixture is mixed evenly. If there are no streaks in the filler or areas that are darker or lighter, it is mixed well.

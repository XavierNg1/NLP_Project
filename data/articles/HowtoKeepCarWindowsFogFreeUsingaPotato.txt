 Be sure to use a clean potato, so wash it first if it is coated in soil. This is a good opportunity to use up an old potato that has started to sprout and is past its best.


You can also use up the potatoes going green.;
, Wipe from side to side to cover all of the window. This will clean it and leave a layer that will prevent condensation from forming on the window.


If you notice starch streaks forming, wipe them off. You may need to wipe more quickly to avoid leaving any streaks.
You can also cut off dirtied slices or parts of the potato half and continue with the clean part.
 If you're doing all of the windows, you'll probably need to use up both potato halves.
 The potato juice should dry clear and the windows will remain fog-free, as the starch in the potato acts as a barrier between the glass and the air.


While the potato film is drying, don't touch it or you'll leave fingerprints dirtying the window.
Throw the used potato into the compost.

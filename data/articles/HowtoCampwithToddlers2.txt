 Examples of toys you should bring are plastic shovels and buckets, balls, or a can of bubbles and a bubble wand.


Bring waterproof toys or those that you don't mind getting dirty, that are fairly large in size. In most cases, toys that you bring camping may easily become lost, wet, or extremely dirty.
 A favorite blanket or stuffed animal can prevent your toddler from feeling homesick or uncomfortable while spending time away from home.
 Your toddler may become cold, wet, or dirty several times per day on your camping trip and require frequent changes of clothing.


Bring multiple plastic shopping bags or trash bags with you on the camping trip, then place your toddler's dirty, wet, and soiled clothes in the bags. This will keep dirty clothes separated from clean, dry clothes.
 Depending on where you camp, your toddler may be exposed to hours of direct sunlight or mosquitoes and other pests.
 Since toddlers will most likely become messy while playing and eating outdoors, these items can help keep your toddler fairly clean and free of bacteria throughout the day.
 Examples of snacks that can keep your toddler well-nourished in between meals are granola bars, crackers, dried fruit, and trail mix.
 For safety purposes, you should bring a first-aid kit and flashlights.


You can choose a family-sized tent to accommodate all your family members or separate tents for the parents and kids. Also bring toddler- or children-sized sleeping bags that contain comfortable mats or pads. Kid-specific sleeping bags will keep your toddler warmer at night.

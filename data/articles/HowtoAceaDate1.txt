 Shave first with the grain, applying a generous amount of lotion. Then, with very, very light strokes shave against the grain to achieve a close shave. Apply a neutral-smelling, cool aftershave.;
, Shave several hours before your date, as you skin may temporarily feel irritated and itchy.
 Wash your hair. Be impeccably clean. This is absolutely vital, as no woman ever feels drawn to a grizzly bear. Pay particular attention to details: nails, ears, nose, etc... Use gentle shampoo and soap, with a light, fruity and fresh scent. Don't use strongly scented products - you will use a more virile cologne later.
,, Apply it behind the ears, on the wrists and on the chest. Use no more than 4-5 squirts. Opt for classics such as Eau Sauvage, Hugo Boss Bottled, Le Male, or choose warm, rich, woody and sensual scents. Opt for citrusy, fresh scents only if the weather is very hot. Avoid sporty fragrances.
 Rely on classics, and make sure your clothes are fitting, well-ironed and clean (very clean). Here are some proposed outfits: autumn and spring: sleek brown brogues, slim beige chinos, white shirt tucked in, a colored scarf, trench coat; winter: sleek Chelsea black boots, black trousers, shirt and jumper (sober color), dark scarf, pea-coat, leather gloves; summer: loafers, slim dark blue chinos, un-tucked light shirt or T-shirt. You got the message. Avoid excessively formal attire, and instead go for smart and casual outfits. Always have a spark of color when wearing coats. A scarf is the best solution.

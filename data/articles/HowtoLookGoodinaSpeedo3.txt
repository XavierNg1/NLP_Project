 Positive affirmations can be a good way to feel confident, even when you’re in a speedo. Put the speedo on and stand in front of a mirror. Then, repeat affirmations like, “I look great in this speedo” or “I am feeling confident and positive in this speedo.”Try repeating the affirmations on a daily basis until you feel ready to step out in the speedo. You can also say the affirmations before you go out in the speedo to feel good when wearing it.
 Once you are wearing the speedo outside, try to project confidence and positivity through your body language. Stand straight and walk tall. Maintain eye contact with others and keep your hands relaxed at your sides or on your hips.Avoid slouching or crouching down in the speedo. Do not cross your hands over your chest, as this will indicate to others that you are feeling insecure or unsure in the speedo.
 To improve your confidence in the speedo, try wearing it around your house when you are alone. Get used to the feeling of not having much on and showing off your body. Over time, you may feel confident enough to wear the speedo out at the pool or the beach in front of others.

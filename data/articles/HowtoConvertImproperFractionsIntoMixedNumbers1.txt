 Start by writing your improper fraction. Then, divide the numerator by the denominator — in other words, just do the division problem that the fraction is already set up for. Don't forget to include the remainder.


Let's follow along with an example. Let's say that we need to turn the fraction 7/5 into a mixed number. We'll start by dividing 7 by 5, like this:
7/5 → 7 ÷ 5 = 1 R2;
, The whole number part of your mixed number (the big number to the left of your fraction) is the whole number answer of your division problem. In other words, just write the answer of the division problem without the remainder.


In our example, since our answer is 1 R2, we would leave off the remainder and just write 1.
 Now, we need to find the fraction part of the mixed number. Put the remainder from your division problem in the numerator and use the same denominator from your original improper fraction. Put this fraction next to your whole number and you have your mixed number!


In our example, our remainder is 2. Putting this over our original denominator (5), we get 2/5. We put this next to our whole number answer (1) to get our final mixed number, like this:

1 2/5.
 Mixed numbers look good on paper and are easy to read, but they're not always the best choice. For example, if we're multiplying a fraction and a mixed number, our work will be a lot easier if we convert the mixed number back into an improper fraction. To do this, just multiply the whole number by the denominator and add it to the numerator.


If we wanted to convert our example answer (1 2/5) back to an improper fraction, we would do it like this:
1 × 5 = 5 → (2 + 5)/5 = 7/5

 Persimmon trees are a great addition to your home orchard. They are aesthetically pleasing and produce nice fruit. Like any tree, persimmons flourish under certain conditions.Make sure that you live somewhere that is temperate enough for a persimmon tree. They flourish in areas with moderate winters and mild summers.
These trees do not perform well in high heats. They cannot thrive in desert climates, and the bark is especially susceptible to sunburn.
The first persimmon tree was grown in China. They have proven to be very adaptable to the climate in California.
 Persimmons can flourish with a minimum of fertilization. They will grow in a variety of soil types, but they will do best in a fertilizer that is well-drained. Try to plant your tree in a patch of earth that will be fully exposed to the sun.Purchase some organic fertilizer at your garden center. Take a few handfuls and spread it around the base of your tree.
Next, spread a layer of mulch around the tree. The mulch should be 4-6 inches deep.
Spread the mulch in an 18 inch radius around your tree. Then water the area thoroughly.
 Persimmons are orange or red-brown in color. They grow on trees like plums, but look similar to a small tomato. Persimmons taste pleasantly sweet, particularly when they are very ripe.Persimmon trees are very slow to bear fruit. It can take up to 8 years for your tree to fully produce a crop of persimmons.
Persimmon trees are sometimes alternate bearing. This means that a single tree may produce a large crop one year, and almost no fruit the next year.
Pick your persimmons in early fall. You can tell when they are ripe when they become more orange and reach the consistency of a soft-boiled egg.

 Downies are about 15 centimeters (7 inches) long.They are black and white, with a white stripe down their backs. The downy woodpeckerâ€™s black bill is straighter and narrower than that of other birds, allowing it to chisel hard wood.


Males have a red cap on their heads. It first appears on the forehead and moves toward the back of the head as they age.
A small tuft of white fur is present at the base of the bill between the eyes.
 Downies have black wings with flecks of white. A white stripe runs down the center of the back, and their chests are also white or grayish. Their eyes are contained within a large black splotch of fine feathers surrounded by white feathers., Downies are easy to confuse with their close relative, the hairy woodpecker.There are several distinct differences that separate the two species:


Hairy woodpeckers are quite a bit larger -- around nine inches long from head to tail -- and have longer bills than downies.
The outer edges of their tail feathers are white, whereas downy woodpeckers have black spots on their outer tail feathers.
Hairy woodpeckers have a slim black mark on their shoulders that arcs downward toward the chest. In downies, this mark is relatively short and far less prominent.

 Melanomas can be identified by checking the moles on your body. This includes a change in the way your skin looks or feels around a mole. You can use the ABCDE rule as a guide to check for changes. If you have any of these warning signs, let your physician know.Asymmetry: One half of the mole looks or feels different than the other half.

Border: Normal moles have regular, relatively smooth borders. Melanomas tend to have irregular, notched, ragged, blurry, or uneven borders.

Color: If the color of the area of skin is uneven, like if it contains various shades of brown, black, or other colors, it may be a sign of skin cancer.

Diameter: Any spot of different-looking skin larger than ¼ inch should be checked.

Evolving or changing spot: The changes in the area can be in size, shape, color or texture, like. bumpy versus smooth.
 Write down the date of your mole check and make detailed notes about your moles— include the specific location, size, color, shape and anything else you observed during your check. You can print out a picture of a human body and mark the areas where you have moles, too. There are even apps that help you monitor you moles, allowing you to upload photos and mark their location on a 3D model.
 Though checking the moles on your body are the best ways to find symptoms, there are other warning signs you can look for. Additional warning signs include:A sore that does not heal

 Pull everything out and set it aside. At this time, it might also be a good idea to sort out any opened pens, and toss them.
 This will help get rid of most of the dust and debris. You might want to do this over a dust bin.
 Lay the bag on its side first, then pull the lining out. Roll the lint roller across the lining, turn your bag over, and do the other side. If your bag is large enough, you might be able to fit the entire roller inside it, without pulling the lining out.








If you don't have a lint roller, use a piece of tape to pick up any dust and debris.
 Set your bag down on the floor. Fit the end of your vacuum cleaner nozzle with the upholstery or fabric brush attachment. Stick the nozzle inside your bag, and vacuum up any debris. Use a lower power setting so that you do not damage the lining., Combine 1 part white vinegar and 1 part hot water in a bowl. Dip a clean cloth into this mixture, squeeze out the excess water, and wipe down the inside of your bag.
 Open up a box of baking soda and stick it upright inside your bag. Leave it there overnight, and take it out the next morning. The baking soda will have absorbed most of the bad smells.


The top of the box should sit below the opening of your bag. If your bag is too small, pour some baking soda into a small dish or tea cup.

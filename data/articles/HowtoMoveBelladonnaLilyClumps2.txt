 This will be late spring/early summer. Later in the summer after the leaves have disappeared a shoot will appear very quickly (sometimes practically overnight).
 Return one portion to the original place and then move the rest to their new homes in the garden.
 When returning the bulbs to the ground, be sure to place two-thirds of the bulb under the ground.
 Don't be surprised if they don't flower the next season. The disruption may have been too much and the bulb might need time to recuperate.


Note that this plant may flower while completely void of a leaf vegetation.

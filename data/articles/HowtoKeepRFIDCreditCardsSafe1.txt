 This can make it more difficult for thieves to read a particular card, but the protection is limited.;
, If you usually carry your credit cards in a wallet in your back pocket, you are potentially more vulnerable to thieves who could step up behind you with a scanning device. If you switch the cards to a front pocket, you will tend to be more observant of people in front of you and are less likely to become a victim., Some of the newest RFID technology limits the opportunity of thieves to scan your cards to short distances and only at the time of the sale.Before using your card in a store, check around you to make sure that nobody is standing within a few feet of you, and your transaction should be safe.
 If you are really concerned by the RFID technology, this is a possible way to go, and you can then use other credit cards or cash to purchase things outside your home. However, identity theft through online computer use is probably a greater risk than using the RFID technology in a store.
 This may not actually prevent thieves from stealing information from your card, but monitoring your statements regularly will help you and the credit card company identify any unauthorized purchases and can limit your potential losses.Some sources say that regular monitoring of your credit card statements is actually the “best” protection against identity theft.

 The chances are that you are not the only person who has spotted the celebrity from afar. Consequently, there might be other people, including children, asking for an autograph or a picture as well. Let the children go first. Don’t push ahead of them or shove them to the side so you can get your signature. The celebrity might find this offensive, and might not sign your paper or take a picture with you., When asking for an autograph or a picture, always be polite. Say “please” when asking, and say “thank you” when they have signed or after the picture has been taken. Remember that celebrities appreciate manners, too.Don't scream at them. You will probably scare them off if you do this.
 Be aware that there are people out there who make money from selling pictures and signatures online. Besides your own memorabilia, if you are trying to get another autograph for a friend or a family member, then that is fine. But trying to get five different things signed seems greedy and suspicious.Try not to ask them to sign odd things, like body parts, clothing, toilet seats, and other unconventional things. The celebrity might find it offensive and you will not get an autograph.
 If a celebrity agrees to take a picture with you, don’t turn it into a photo shoot. Be aware that celebrities have places to be, and that there are other people waiting to get an autograph or a picture, too.
 Don’t try to get too close or touch the celebrity when asking for an autograph or photo. For example, some celebrities are sensitive about their hair or their clothes. If you respect their personal space, and follow the celebrity’s lead on how to act around them, they will be more willing to acquiesce to your request.

 Look at the border of the spot to see if they appear irregular, ragged, blurred, or notched. Notice if the spot is Â¼ inch across or larger, about the size of the pencil eraser. The shape of the spot may also change over time, becoming larger., The spot may be irritated or swollen, or become more so over time. It may also painful or tender to the touch.You should also take note if the spot starts to ooze, bleed, or becomes scaly.

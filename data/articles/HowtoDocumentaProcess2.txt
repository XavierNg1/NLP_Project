 Flowcharts are great for depicting basic information in an easy to read, visual style. They can be used to guide new workers through simple tasks during job training, or to assist a worker who is performing a task temporarily due to a coworker's absence.
 When making a flowchart, you'll write a box for each task within the process, and connect them with arrows to show which order you perform these tasks. Start at the left-hand side or the top of the page, just as you would when writing. Sequencing the steps in this order makes it easy to tell at a glance which to follow.


If you are working in a language with a different direction of writing than English, use that direction instead. For instance, a flowchart written in Arabic moves from right to left.
Use arrows to make the direction clear. Don't just draw lines without arrows between the tasks.
 If your flowchart is small enough to fit in one row or column, you may not need this circle. For more complicated flowcharts, having an obvious circle labeled "start" is useful.
 Draw an arrow pointing from the "start" circle to a box with the first task inside it. For instance, "take customer's order."

, This arrow points to the next box, with the second task written inside it. If there is a decision to make or a question to answer before the second task can be performed, write the question inside a diamond instead.


Use a different color for the diamond than the boxes, if possible.
 For example, say the box with the task "Take customer's order" leads to a diamond, with the question "was water ordered?" Draw two arrows leaving the diamond. On one arrow, write "yes" or "y" and lead to a box labeled "give customer water." On the second arrow, write "no" or "n" and lead to a box labeled "give order to cook."

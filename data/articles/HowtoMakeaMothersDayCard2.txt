 Look for paper that’s one single color to use as the base part of your card. Then try to find some patterned scrapbook paper that compliments the color of your card. Find out what your mom’s favorite color is if you don’t already know. Try to get some paper in this color as an added gesture.
You can also use ribbons if you wish.
 Fold your thick piece of cardstock in half to make your card. Then cut strips of your scrapbook paper to adhere to the cardstock.


You can cut the strips at different widths so that you can layer each one over the last one. This will give a nice texture and look to the card.
 To finish the outside of your card, add something like a ribbon with a bow on it or a little message to your mom. You can also write something like “To Mom” with a fine-point marker and then punch holes through it with a pin to add even more texture and variety.
Small gems can also be an added touch that ties the card together. , On the inside write your mom a nice message showing her how much you care.


If you’re feeling really creative, you can even write her a poem.

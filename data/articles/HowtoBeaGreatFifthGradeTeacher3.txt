 A calendar will help you plan your classes and units so that you cover all of the required material by the end of the year. It will also help you keep track of meetings, due dates, and any other administrative tasks. Consider keeping a classroom calendar that includes holidays and events that students need to know about. You and your class may also want to include student birthdays on this calendar.
 Students will need to use folders, notebooks, textbooks, and other materials on a daily basis. Decide on how you will organize such materials and where they will be placed around the room. Many teachers like to keep things color-coded by subject and assign numbers for each students.
Remember that space may be limited. Consider using cubbies and shelves to store student materials.
 Teachers handle a great deal of paperwork, including lesson plans, worksheets, student work, and general school announcements. Create a filing system at school (and at home, if necessary) for the many papers you will be handling. Consider organizing lessons and grades on the computer. There are many online tools that help you track student grades. Your school may even have its own website for grades and student assignments.
Accordion folders, crates, and bins are all helpful for managing papers. Consider using unconventional tools like mason jars and old suitcases to organize other materials.
 Being a teacher can feel like a 24-hour job. Between administrative duties, calling parents, lesson planning, grading, and actually teaching, your time can go by very quickly. Prioritize your tasks and set aside time for each one during the week. Donâ€™t forget to schedule time for yourself too!

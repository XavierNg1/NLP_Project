 You'll find a search bar like the one above.;
, For example, let's say you want to factor 2x^5 - 19x^4 + 58x^3 - 67x^2 + 56x - 48. To get the answer, type "factor 2x^5 - 19x^4 + 58x^3 - 67x^2 + 56x - 48" in the text field without the quotation marks and press enter.
 Provided that you didn't make any errors in typing the problem, you'll have the correct answer, plus a graphical representation, and much more.
 Be sure to study the answers the site provides so that you can really understand how the solution was reached. And while this is a fun way to solve algebraic problems, you should still continue to solve algebraic problems on your own using complete working out methods and not merely rely on this website; chances are, you won't have use of it in your math exams!

Using this tool is a good way to check the solutions you've come up with for problems that you've already worked out on paper.
 Simply type in the word "algebra" in the search box. Note the many results that return and click on ones that interest you to explore more options! This is a fun and very easy way to extend your understanding of a fascinating branch of pure mathematics; when you enjoy a topic, understanding comes faster.

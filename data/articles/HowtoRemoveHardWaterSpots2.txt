 If you let it sit and soak in for a few minutes instead of wiping it off right away, it'll have more time to break down the mineral deposits holding the scum in place. Let it soak in for a good 5 - 10 minutes before you try to wipe it off. Use a scrub brush to loosen thicker deposits.


You can also soak a towel in the vinegar solution and drape it over the stained surface. This works well for shower floors and bathtubs.
 Look for a bathroom cleaner made for getting rid of hard water stains and soap scum. This should be a last resort, since hydrochloric acid is a harsh chemical.Make sure the room is well-ventilated - open the windows and turn on the fans - then spray the stained area with the appropriate cleaner. Wipe it away, then rinse the surface with water and dry it.


Be sure to wear gloves when handles hydrochloric acid.

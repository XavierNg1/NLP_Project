 This takes you to the place where you can name your clan, set who can watch your clan chat, set who can talk on your clan chat, set who is able to kick people from your clan chat, and give ranks to the people in your clan.;
, Choosing a clan name is needed if you want to use this feature. However, it must be 12 letters/numbers or less. Remember, you can always change your clan's name if you want to.
 Entering the chat means to watch the chat. You can choose who has the ability to enter the chat. This is helpful because it can stop rival clans from seeing the clan talking.
 Now you get to control who can talk in the chat. So this can help if you only want people observing your clan chat if you don't want them talking in it.
 Kicking people from chat is basically throwing them out of chat so that person can't talk. It's normally a good idea not to let untrusted people kick because they could kick people you're trying to have a discussion with or yourself! This is good for annoying people coming in chatting.
 The person who hosts the chat is automatically the Channel Owner. The other ranks which can be given out are from highest to lowest rank: General, Captain, Lieutenant, Sergeant, Corporal , Recruit, and Friend. You can only give ranks to people on your friends list. If they are not in your clan and are on your friends list, the are automatically a Friend.
 You do not need to press any save buttons. So when you feel satisfied with your new clan, click the X button.

 Cut out foods that are high in sugar, salt, and fat. These include cookies, chips, candy, and processed meats. You may need to wean yourself off these slowly. Start by restricting how many sodas, snacks, and desserts you take in a week before eliminating them completely from your diet.


Don’t be fooled by labels like “fat-free,” “reduced fat,” or “sugar free.” Usually, in order to replace these missing components, companies fill these foods with other unhealthy additives. Fat-free foods often have more sugar than full fat foods! ;
, Swap sodas and sugary juices for water. Water flushes toxins out of your body via the kidney and bladder, regulates your body temperature, and hydrates your skin. It is essential for most bodily processes. Thus water is an essential part of any detox.


When you’re hungry, try drinking a glass of water. It can help suppress hunger. If you’re still hungry, then have a snack.
 Alcohol and caffeine are antidiuretics, which means that they dehydrate your body. Hydration is key to a successful detox. You should put aside your nighttime glass of wine or morning coffee until the detox is over. If you want something other than water, try non-caffeinated tea, such as green or herbal tea.
 Fiber keeps you full longer (so you don’t snack), and high-fiber diets can reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Fruits and vegetables are a key source of fiber. Rely on natural sources of fiber instead of processed fiber bars that may be full of sugar.

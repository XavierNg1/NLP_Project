 Headquarters is simply the most safest and one of the fastest leveling up games on Call of Duty. Considering if your team has control of the HQ then you get +10 experience per 5 sec you have control over it. The 10 experience points means you get 5 and your team's overall score get plus 5, so therefore the +10 is split in half.;
, In free for all, if you're the best player in the game then you can rack up some experience quite fast. But only if you're the best player in the game, cause there is a score limit.
 Domination is another fast way to develop experience in both mental stability and in the game. Cause the more flags, of which there are three, your team has, the more experience points that are awarded to your side of the engagement.
 This is the fastest way to develop experience on Call of Duty. But, if you wish to play this type of game you have to know how to play it. In Search and Destroy, you have two opportunities in the game. One, is whenever you have the bomb and your objective is to play up the target with it. There are two targets labeled "A" & "B". Two, is whenever your on the hunt for the team with the bomb, whilst defending the "A" and "B" targets. You get +100 experience per kill(which means you get 50, and your team gets 50) and +200 if you successfully plant the bomb(must have the bomb, and you receive 100, and your team receives 100).But on the contrary, if you die, you don't re-spawn until the next round. First to 4 wins the match-up.

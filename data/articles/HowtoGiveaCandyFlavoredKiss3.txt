 You can find these online or in dollar stores. From fruity flavors to root beer to your favorite brand of candy, there's a lip gloss out there that will fit your or your partner's tastes.
 Don't cake it on, as that can be sticky and gross. Do this right before you plan to make your move.


Try wearing a fragrance that is similar to the flavor of your lip gloss. If you are wearing strawberry lip gloss, look for a fruity body spray and apply just a hint. When you lean in for the kiss, your partner will have the smell in their nose and may experience the taste with more intensity.

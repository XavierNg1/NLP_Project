 In order to prevent injury, you should always spend ten to fifteen minutes warming up your muscles by stretching. Do active or dynamic stretches before your workout in order to get your muscles moving. Some stretches to try include, straight kicks, hamstring stretches, inch-worm push-ups, and side shuffles.Following your workout you should also stretch out your legs to reduce muscle tightness.
 When you are training to build your leg muscles, it is very important that you give your legs a chance to recover and rebuild. Always leave a rest day between each leg workout day. If you still want to hit the gym, that is fine, but focus on a different muscle group, such as your back, arms, or abs.Be sure to have at least two complete rest days each week with no weight training.
 If your leg muscles begin to tighten, you can use a foam roller before or after your workout to help loosen your muscles and decrease muscle soreness. Roll the foam overtop of tight muscles for approximately 20 to 30 seconds.

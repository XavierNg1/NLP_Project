 Make sure you choose an outfit that's flattering on your body type. Something that genuinely fits is key. However, if you want to get noticed, it's okay to wear clothing that's slightly more sexual or revealing. You may want to wear clothing that's a little tighter than your normal style, if you feel comfortable doing so.


Do not pick something that shows everything off, but do choose something that compliments your best features. If you prefer a low-cut front, for example, don't also go for a lower cut back. If you're proud of your back muscles, go for something low-cut in the back but higher in the front.A suit can be great club wear, if you choose one that's not too dressy. A blue suit jacket, for example, worn without a tie can be a nice club outfit.You can also go casual, but make sure to pick something flattering. Fitted jeans can help you show off your legs or, if you're curvier, your curves. A tighter t-shirt can work great. If you want to add a splash of formality, wear a nice blazer over a fitted t-shirt.;
, Wear shoes that you love. Uncomfortable shoes that are difficult to dance in are not the shoes you want to wear at the club. Choose something that goes well with your outfit and is stylish. Most clubs are dark. People aren’t usually going to be looking at your feet.Select a comfortable shoe like flats or sneakers. This will allow you to dance flirtatiously, getting a guy's attention.
 Keep in mind that if you’re dancing, sweat is likely. Wear makeup and a hairstyle that is going to stay in place through the night. For makeup, you might want to change your normal daytime style to something more dramatic -- stronger colors, smokier, more shine, etc.You can also opt for waterproof makeup products, as this may stay intact more throughout the night.
You can use hairspray to keep your hair neat throughout the night.

 A panic attack usually occurs because of a stressful situation. What actually causes an individual to suffer with panic disorder is unknown; however, this condition tends to run in families. Women and individuals in their 20s or 30s are at higher risk for suffering panic attacks. Symptoms that are commonly experienced during a panic attack, but are not common during a heart attack include:


Intense terror
Sweaty palms
Flushed face
Chills
Muscle twitching
Feeling like you need to escape
Fear of ‘”going crazy”
Hot flashes
Trouble swallowing, or a tightness in your throat
Headache
These symptoms may end within five minutes, or may peak after 20 minutes.
 If anyone who has previously experienced a heart attack has any of the symptoms listed above, they should visit the emergency room. An individual who has been diagnosed with a panic disorder and is concerned about suffering a heart attack should request a cardiac evaluation.

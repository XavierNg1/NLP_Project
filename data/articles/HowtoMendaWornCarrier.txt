The left section will be completed hidden so the edge do not have to be covered.
The middle section will be visible.
The right section will not be visible and will come in contact with the belt. The raw edges must be covered with a zig zag or at least two seams to prevent it from fraying.;
,

Have an excellent lighting system here and at all times.
Put on your reading glasses and use an LED magnifying glass on a gooseneck stand.
Open the carrier with the seam ripper, iron it and place on a thin but strong polyester fabric. You must have enough to cover the middle section of your three sectional carrier.
Use fabric glue sparingly on the back side of the worn carrier to strengthen it, if it bonds to the thin, polyester fabric.. fine! Fabric glue can seep through the layers of fabric and be visible from the outside however because a worn carrier will be thin it is important to fortify it. Ironing adhesive facing to the worn carrier fabric is an alternative but it will add a little bulk to it.
 Note that the right section is a bit wider than necessary because it will be easier to work with.,,, Compare the width other carriers with a ruler with small increments., Alternately, cut off the excess fabric after Step 8., Mark with a straight edge the two lines with a wax pencil and sew directly and evenly on the lines.,

Hand sew the carrier firmly on the waistband.
Measure how the other carriers were sewn on the waistband and follow those measurements exactly and accurately. You will need the: 1) the excess fabric measurements from the fold at the top and bottom, 2) the stitch distance from the top of the waistband, 3) the distance of the bottom stitch to the bottom of the carrier, and 4) the zig zag width.
Mark with a wax pencil the outline of the carrier on the waistband so if it moves you will know. The correct placement of the carrier will not be known until after you have finished sewing, you must mark the outline and other markings.

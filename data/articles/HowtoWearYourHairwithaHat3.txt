 Straight hair is classic and classy. Add some anti-frizz serum to your post-washing routine, and then blow dry your hair using a round brush. Run a straightener through your hair, one section at a time, until it become straight and frizz-free. Add a cute fedora hat or a floppy hat with flowers.Try to use the blow dryer and the hair straightener on low heat. This may take longer to complete the job, but it will protect your hair in the long run.
 Twirl your hair up into a bun, or twist it into a cute semi-ponytail. Focus on the details so that theyâ€™ll still be visible once the hat is on. Place the hat carefully on top of your up-do and head out for an elegant night.

Try this cute rolled up-do. Start with a loose ponytail and twist the length, bringing it back across the back of your head and tucking in the ends., Use a brush to comb your hair back into a sleek ponytail. Try doing the bottom half first, then brushing back the top half and combining it with the existing ponytail.Make sure the level of your ponytail works with the position of your hat.

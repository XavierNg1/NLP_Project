 This should be planned about five months before the wedding date, including booking the site for the rehearsal dinner. In addition, let those attending know early on that they're expected to be a part of rehearsals. These events are held within the week leading up to the wedding.


You may want to create a schedule for the bridal party for the day of the wedding, so that they know what time they need to be places for things such as hair appointments, photos, ceremony, etc.
Rehearsal dinners are a North American tradition that has begun to occur in other Anglo-speaking countries too. If you don't want to hold one, it's not essential.

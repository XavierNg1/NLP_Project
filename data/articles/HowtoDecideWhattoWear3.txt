 Humidity causes you to sweat more than you would normally, and it’s important to consider this if you want your clothing to remain sweat free. When dressing for humidity, choose outfits that fall away from your body and touch your skin as little as possible.Avoid synthetic fabrics at all costs.
Swap out jeans and t-shirts in favor of long, flowy dresses.
 It’s very hard to look fashionable when you’re also trying not to freeze to death, but it can be done. Pick warm fabrics like wool, fleece, cashmere, down and flannel and avoid cotton.Dress in heavy layers and don’t skimp on the outerwear. You can always take it off inside.
Do not leave any exposed skin. Exposed skin leaves you vulnerable to frostbite. If you’re concerned about wearing the wrong shoes, bring a cuter pair of shoes to change into once you’re inside.
 Some areas of the world experience extreme temperature fluctuations – even within the course of just one day. Dress for the unexpected by wearing extra layers and packing additional layers to wear when your light layers just don’t cut it.In addition to wearing a light cardigan, pack an anorak or fleece for when the sun goes down.
If a simple pair of tights is not sufficient, double up on tights, or swap out regular tights in favor of fleece lined leggings.
If you’re carrying a purse or bag, throw in an extra pair of socks, along with some mittens and a warm hat.

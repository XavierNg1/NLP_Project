 One way to help a teenager find a hobby is to focus on their strengths and what makes them feel good. Many teens may only focus on weakness or things they have failed at. Instead, emphasize anything that they enjoy doing or that makes them happy.For example, your teen may be interested in music, sports, computers, crafting, role playing games, or science.
A person doesn’t have to be good at a hobby to enjoy it. Hobbies aren’t necessarily talents. If your teen loves to play an instrument or a sport but is just mediocre, that’s okay! As long as they feel good while doing it, it can turn into a hobby.;
, Maybe your teen has been wanting to try something for a long time but has been unsure if you would agree to it. However, you might just get a shrug in response. That is normal; asking "what do you want to do?" is a pretty vague and broad question. Tell your teen to think about it, and then ask them about it later.Try asking, "What would you like to do today?" or "What do you want to do this weekend?" You might also try saying, "Let's do something you are interested in today. What would you like to do?"
If your kid wants to cook often or likes to be outside, you may be close to figuring out a good hobby for them.
 Teenagers spend much of their life away from the eyes of parents and don’t always offer up information. As a result, sometimes adults are not entirely aware that adolescents are developing hobbies. Your child may be developing hobbies away from home, so you may not have to encourage them to adopt new ones. Instead, you can support their current hobbies.Ask your teen if they have any hobbies or what they enjoy doing at other people’s houses. Be supportive of their activities so you can encourage a dialogue between the two of you.

 This tool is normally made of plastic or metal and has 2 prongs on the end of it with a tab for you to hold. These tools can be purchased at your local sporting goods store or the golf course's pro shop for a minimal fee.;
, Turn the tool and push the grass toward the center of the ball mark. Be careful to not tear the roots of the grass, which would result in an even larger spot of dead grass. The grass on the green is very elastic. Therefore, you shouldn't do additional damage to the green by twisting and pushing your ball mark tool. Work your way around the divot until you have worked out the ground along its perimeter.


If you do not have a ball mark tool available, you can use other items to lift and push in the turf. Your golf tee or the pencil you use when writing on your scorecard are both acceptable substitutes. Use these in the same manner; however, since they are slimmer, you will need to tilt them at an angle to work through more of the grass with each twisting motion.
 This will restore the slope of the terrain to match the rest of the green.

 Sometimes they send out pamphlets with the number.;
, There should be about 5 - 15 catalogues.
 This means, you should find a large book-style catalogue, and then place all other items inside this (like putting $10 in a Christmas card). You will then need to fold it in half, as it is only like this that it will fit in the letterboxes.
 This way you can put them in you bag without them falling apart.
 I suggest walking to deliver, as being on a bike can be a hassle. Do not deliver to "No Junk Mail" letter boxes. You might like to do your block in two or three sections. If you are delivering in the US, do not place any of your literature in the letterboxes as this is a violation of federal postal laws punishable by severe fines. Instead deliver to the front door and leave materials at the doorstep.

 If you have an agent, he or she will find auditions for you. If you don't, look at www.backstage.com and other actors' websites for auditions in your area.


Aim to audition as often as you can. Even when you don't get the role, it's great practice.
 Prepare to read a monologue that seems in sync with the role you're auditioning for. Remember that you should have several monologues prepared in case you are asked to read more than one.


Dress appropriately for the role. If you're reading the part of a businesswoman, wear a suit and dress shoes.
 You may be given material that you're asked to read without practicing first. You can prepare for this beforehand by reading a variety of screenplays and monologues. Practice with a friend to simulate the experience of reading in front of an audience.
 Auditioning is about being judged, and, very often, rejected. Sometimes you’ll do a great job, but you weren’t what they were looking for. Other times, you just might flub your lines. Learn to shake it off and keep going. And remember, even if they don’t hire you, casting directors are sympathetic to how hard it is to audition.
 Auditioning will be a part of your acting career from beginning to end. Treat it as part of your job. As you begin to take roles, use what you learned the next time you audition. It may be years before you're able to make a living as an actress, but be persistent. As you polish your skills and learn more about your craft, more opportunities will be open to you.

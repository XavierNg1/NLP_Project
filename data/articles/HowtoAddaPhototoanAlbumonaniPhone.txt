If Photos opens to a photo, tap the Back button in the top left corner of the screen first.
 It should be in the top left side of the "Albums" page.


If the photo you want to add to an album is in a specific album (e.g., "Selfies"), tap that album instead.
 It's in the top right corner of the screen.
 A white checkmark on a blue background will appear in the bottom right corner of the photo's thumbnail.


You can select multiple photos in this way.
 This option is at the bottom of the screen.
 The first few albums on the "Add to Album" are stock iPhone albums to which you can't add photos, but you can add your photo to any custom photo albums at the bottom of this page. Tapping an album will automatically add your selected photo(s) to it.


If you don't have any custom albums, tap New Album... at the top of this page and follow the on-screen instructions to create a new one.

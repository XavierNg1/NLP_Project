 Doctors know that ketosis is caused by an increased level of ketones in the system as a result of the body burning fat as fuel.There are certain factors that can put you into a state of ketosis, which if left unchecked, can develop into the more dangerous state of ketoacidosis, which can lead to serious conditions such as brain swelling.Factors that can put you in a state of ketosis are:


Eating a low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet for weight loss or building muscle massHaving diabetes (there is a greater risk for those with type 1 diabetes, but people with type 2 diabetes can develop ketosis as well) Being male
Experiencing emotional or physical trauma or stress
Abusing drugs and alcohol
Having surgeryKetoacidosis occurs when the levels of ketones present during a state of ketosis rise above levels that are healthy.Ketoacidosis can lead to loss of consciousness and even death.;
, There are some key signs associated with ketosis that can help you determine if your body is in this state. This can help you monitor your level of ketones and minimize your risk for developing ketoacidosis.The signs of ketosis include:Dry mouth
Bad or "fruity"-smelling breath or metallic taste in your mouth
Strong urine odor
Decreased appetite
Feelings of euphoria or increased energy
Excessive thirst

, Because ketosis can quickly progress into the dangerous state of ketoacidosis, paying close attention to your body and its functions is important. This can help you get timely treatment and prevent bigger issues.If you are in ketosis, note when the signs start and if and under what conditions they cease. Keeping notes may help you more readily identify if you are in a state of ketosis or ketoacidosis.Understand that the signs of ketosis can vary from person to person. It can be obvious for some that they are in a state of ketosis, while others may not recognize it as readily., If you suspect you are in a state of ketosis, you can test for it at home. By measuring blood sugar or testing urine, you may be able to confirm it and ensure that your ketone levels remain healthy.You can monitor ketone levels in your blood with an at-home kit.If your blood sugar is over 240mg/dl, you may have too many ketones in your system.You can purchase ketone testing kits at many pharmacies or medical supply stores. These kits require a urine sample, which will change color to indicate the amount of ketones in your system.It’s important to use a dipstick and a clean-catch urine sample to get the most optimal results., If you suspect your level of ketones are too high, schedule an appointment to see your doctor. She can provide a definitive diagnosis and help you formulate an effective plan to keep your levels of ketones in check.Your doctor may order a blood ketone test. This will require a sample from a vein or a finger stick.This may be a more effective test than a urinalysis.
Your doctor may order a urine test to determine the amount of ketones in your system; however, this may not be as accurate because it can take time for the ketones to pass through your system.Ketoacidosis can cause problems with your heart, so you may need and EKG as well.
 If your doctor confirms that you are in a state of ketosis, he may suggest ways to keep your ketone levels within a healthy and manageable range. This may include everything from watching your diet to counseling. It is important to follow your doctor’s suggestions in order to minimize your risk developing ketoacidosis.There are several different ways to manage the amount of ketones in your system. These include: fluid replacement, insulin therapy, blood sugar monitoring, hydration and changing your diet., If you exercise regularly, you may want to refrain from vigorous activity if your ketone levels are high.Exercise often increases the number of ketones in the body and avoiding it can prevent your ketosis from developing into ketoacidosis.If you need some form of activity to help you feel good, consider light activities such as walking or biking while your ketone levels are high.
 Staying hydrated is often the most effective way to control the level of ketones in your body.By drinking enough water throughout the day, you may be able to effectively eliminate excessive ketones from your system.Most people need nine to 13 cups of water per day, and up to 16 if you are active or pregnant.Water and other non-caloric beverages are the best liquids with which to flush out your system.Avoid drinking too much caffeine or alcohol when your ketones are high, as these can dehydrate you and may thus increase the levels of ketones in your system., Most individuals who consume a healthy, well-balanced diet do not experience increased levels of ketones. Ceasing a low carbohydrate diet in favor of a balanced diet can help you to manage ketone levels and minimize your risk of developing ketoacidosis.You should eat around 1,800–2,200 calories per day, depending on your activity level.Get calories from a wide variety of nutrient-dense whole foods. Include foods from all of the major food groups of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, and lean proteins. Incorporating foods that you may have avoided, such as bread or pasta, may help keep your ketone levels in check.Be aware that this may make you gain slight weight, but it’s better to minimize the risk of ketoacidosis and related conditions than keeping off a couple of pounds by avoiding otherwise nutritious foods., If your elevated ketone levels are a result of diabetes or other issues with your blood sugar, control it as best you can through insulin and diet. This may help manage ketone levels and prevent related conditions.If you are giving yourself insulin shots, your doctor may prescribe a temporary increase in your dosage or the number of injections you get daily., If you have ketosis as a result of malnutrition from anorexia or bulimia, your doctor may refer you to counseling. A therapist can help you work through your issues with food, which in turn may help resolve high ketone levels and prevent ketoacidosis.If you are reducing carbohydrates to reduce weight for any reason, you may want to discuss with a counselor the reason why you are possibly putting your health in jeopardy in pursuit of perceived beauty.

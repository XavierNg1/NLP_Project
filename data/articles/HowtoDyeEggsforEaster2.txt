 If you plan to eat the eggs, make sure to use food-grade dyes.









Add a teaspoon of vegetable oil to each container of dye. Note that if you want to dye some eggs normally or give them a base colour before marbling, do that first. Once the oil is in the dye, you can’t go back! Experiment by adding a bit more oil to the dyes; different amounts create different amounts of marbling.

Better yet, float droplets of a concentrated food coloring-vinegar (for colorfastness) mixture on a bed of shaving cream or float droplets of an oil-based immiscible food coloring on water, rake the color into a loose pattern, and dip the egg briefly to marble it as one would marble paper.You may need to dip one end or side of the egg at a time. A pair of tongs with loop-ended jaws would hold the egg securely and mask very little of its surface. If you use shaving cream, let the egg dry before rubbing off the excess foam.With either method, be prepared for the possibility that the colour may stick to you or what you're wearing better than the egg, even after it's dry.;
, Using a spoon or the dipper that comes with a kit, lower the egg completely into the dye and remove it quickly. Because oil and water don’t mix, you’ll get colour on some parts of the egg, and none on others, creating a marbled effect. Keep dipping to get a brighter color.
 Lightly pat the just-dipped eggs with a paper towel, or the colour may become muddy. If you want to dip them in another colour, wait until they’re completely dry first.
 Moisten a paper towel with vegetable oil and lightly wipe down the finished eggs with it to add a nice shine.
 Refrigerate the eggs until you’re ready to display them.


Wow everyone with your masterpiece!

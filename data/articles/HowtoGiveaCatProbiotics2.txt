 There are some specialized cat treats that include probiotics. These treats are one of the easier methods of providing probiotics to your cat, as most cats will typically just eat them like any other treat and require no coercing.Most larger pet stores will carry probiotic treats. But if you have trouble finding them, consult your veterinarian for advice.
 If other methods have failed you, try sprinkling probiotic powder on your cat’s food. This is a great way to ensure your cat gets a little probiotic in its system every time it eats some of its food. Make sure you follow the directions for how much to give your cat and don’t exceed the recommended dose.This kind of powder should be available at any pet store, or at your local veterinarian’s office.
 If you have trouble getting your cat to take the probiotics in any of the various forms, you can always enlist the help of your veterinarian. Your vet will be able to use their expertise to coerce your cat into ingesting the probiotics.In a worst case scenario, your vet can hold down the cat and force it to take the probiotics, or even provide them via injection. Either way, it’s better that this comes from your vet instead of you so that the cat will not associate you with the negative experience.

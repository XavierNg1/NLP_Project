 Many children develop a stutter in their first few years of speaking, but while many of them lose the stutter within a year or two, this does not mean you shouldn't help them through it. Speech therapists who are not up to date on modern research may recommend "waiting until it goes away," but it is a far better idea to be conscious of the child's stutter and follow the steps below., If you tend to be a fast speaker, it's possible the child may be copying you by speaking too fast for her language abilities. Try slowing down your speech just a little, keeping a natural rhythm, and make sure you speak clearly., Give the child time to speak at a time and place where they are not being teased or interrupted. If the child is excited about telling you something, pause what you are doing and listen. Children who do not feel they have a place to speak may feel more anxiety over their stutter or become less willing to talk.
 Increase the confidence of the child by listening in a supportive way while he speaks. Don't try to finish his sentence for him, and don't walk away or interrupt when he gets stuck., A relatively modern type of stuttering treatment for children is a system of parental feedback, such as the Lidcombe Program developed in the 1980s. In these systems, a therapist trains the parent or caretaker to assist the child instead of enrolling the child in a therapy program directly. Even if you cannot find a suitable program near you, you can benefit from some of the tenets of this program.Talk to the child about the stutter only if the child wants to.
Compliment the child when they speak without stuttering or have a day with lower levels of stuttering. Do this once or twice a day at consistent times, rather than making a big deal of the stutter by repeating the praise often.
Rarely give negative feedback by pointing out the stutter. Don't do this when the child is upset or frustrated.

 Choose a color palette for your theme that creates the illusion of space like neutral and muted colors.


For a small bedroom with a theme, gravitate cool, calming tones of soothing blues, sea greens, blush pinks, beiges, greys, and crisp whites.Paint your bedroom walls the color that you’ve chosen. With a small bedroom, a simple color scheme is advised. For example, white walls with one accent wall painted a different coordinating color.
 You don’t necessarily have to go for a day bed or a twin bed just because it’s a small bedroom. A bed can act like a focal point for the eye and design of the bedroom.


Iron bed frames or open canopy poster beds are great options to maximize space while being versatile enough to correlate with most themes.
 Play with patterns on your bed. Give a contemporary feel to any room by introducing a mixture of modern and more traditional prints.Incorporate accents in subtle ways, like with a wall (as mentioned in previous steps) or as pops of colors throughout the room: a lamp, accent pillows, a headboard, etc.
Create accents with furnishings: an ornate trunk, an armoire, a sleek night table or desk.

 This can go on display on a large table. For example, make a meatloaf severed hand:


Mix all ingredients in a large bowl.
Sculpt the meat into the shape of a hand on a baking sheet.
Add slices of onion for finger nails and the center of the onion as the wrist bone.
Bake at 350ºF/180ºC for 30 minutes.
Add cheese for skin, and continue to bake.
When the hand is finished cooking, add ketchup or spaghetti sauce as blood, and plastic flies and maggots as decorations.

 Start filling up your bathtub with very warm to hot water. As the bathtub is filling up, add 2 cups of sea salt to the water. The heat of the water will help dissolve the salt.


Don’t use table salt, as this contains only NaCl. It may also contain iodine if it is iodized table salt. Sea salt, on the other hand, contains a wide range of necessary minerals including calcium, magnesium, sodium, chlorine, iodine, potassium, zinc, iron and trace minerals.
Using table salt in a pinch won’t seriously harm you, but it won’t give you the added benefit of all the other minerals found in sea salt.
 Make sure the water temperature is comfortable for you. It’s best to use very warm to hot water for dissolving the sea salt, but you can wait to let the water cool down a bit before getting in.
 Immerse your body in the tub and relax for up to 15 minutes.This will give you a chance to soak your back, chest or arms, which may be affected by acne.
If you have pimples on your face, soak a washcloth in the tub water and place it over your face for 10-15 minutes.
 Use the shower head to rinse off your body. Make sure the sea salt water is completely rinsed off.
 Use a clean cotton towel to dry yourself. Don’t rub yourself with the towel, as this can irritate the skin.
 Consider applying a moisturizer to all your skin. The sea salt can dry out your skin, which is not beneficial. Moisturize your skin with a non-comedogenic moisturizer.

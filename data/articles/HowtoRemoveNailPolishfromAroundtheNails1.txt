 A new, clean eyeshadow brush or an old nail polish brush that you’ve cleaned and sanitized will work perfectly for this. In order to clean a nail polish brush, swirl it around in 2 or 3 drops of nail polish thinner on a plastic plate. Wipe the brush on a piece of cardboard. Repeat this until the brush wipes clean.Nail polish thinner is different than remover. It is most commonly used to restore old bottles of nail polish to their old consistency.
Cardboard is recommended because other materials, like paper towels, will leave lint on the brush.;
, You don’t want to use acetone because it will ruin the fibers of your brush. There are many kinds of extra strength nail polish remover instead that will work just as well in taking polish off of your fingers.
 Choose your desired color. Paint with your basecoat and color. Use as many coats of your colored polish as you need to get the desired color.
 Dip the tip of your brush into the polish remover. You only want to dip the tip because the remover will damage the glue and metal crimp over time. Get rid of excess remover by sweeping the bristles of your brush over the rim of the bottle.








If you don’t wipe the excess remover off of your brush, you’ll end up taking your manicure off along with the polish around your nails.
 Carefully trace the outside of your nails with the brush. Be very careful not to run the brush over your nail, because it will ruin your manicure. Once you’ve done this for every nail, touch up any polish on your nails that you need to. Let dry and apply your top coat.
 Once the top coat has dried, you can take a paper towel that you’ve dampened with warm water and folded. Use the folded corner to wipe around the nails to take off any remaining nail polish remover. Don’t forget to wash your brushes to have them ready for next time!

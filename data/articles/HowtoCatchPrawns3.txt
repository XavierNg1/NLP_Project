 Fishing supply stores usually sell nets in a hand-held variety, similar to a butterfly net, and in a larger commercial varieties adapted for trawlers. Choose which one is right for your prawning needs.
 Create motion in the water around you. Prawns naturally swim with the tide, so your motion will stimulate them to move with the water and come up off the bottom of the bay or tide pool.
 Position your hand-held net behind prawns. Place the spoon in front of them. By instinct, they’ll back away from the shiny object. As they swim backward, they’ll end up in your net., Prawns won’t stay in the net for long if you keep it in the water. As soon as you feel the prawns enter the net, sweep it up with a quick upward forearm movement. Angle the net pointed-side-down to keep the prawns from escaping.
 Do this slowly and behind the school of prawns before disturbing the water in front of them. Make sure there is a fisher with the net ready to gather it up around the prawns when they swim into it with the movement of the water.
 Nets sweep up every solid form in their paths. As soon as you make your catch, inspect the net for animals that aren’t prawns. Even if you know they’re not endangered, toss them back in the water. If you find plastic, metal, or other refuse, toss them in a nearby recycling bin or trashcan.

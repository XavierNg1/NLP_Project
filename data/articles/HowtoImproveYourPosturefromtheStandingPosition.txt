 This a natural stretch, that you might normally after getting up from bed or sitting in a chair. Do it for repetitions (five to ten times minimum) and get more benefit from it.;
, The keywords here are full range and light.

Waist twists. Do the waist twist, with your hands on your hips, with your arms swinging or with dowel on your shoulders. Rotate your spine just a little, instead rotate you body around your spine.
Standing, alternating elbow to knee crunch. If balance is a problem, hold on to something, and do one side at a time.



Do a forward bend and back bend. Forward bend from the hips, return to the upright position and bend backwards like doing the limbo. When bending forward: either reach downwards or keep your arms to your sides. To keep your balance when bending back - look forward and not up.
Break down the forward and back bend. To have a full stretch with the standing back bend, try it separately from the forward bend. Hold on to something solid and bend backwards with your spine and your neck (cervical) spine. It is very important to exercise the spine both ways.
 It is very important to have a strong foundation for your back. Also do lunges to stretch your front thigh muscles and to have a lower back curve. Squat flat footed and on the balls of your feet. Lunges are not an alternative to the squat but a supplementary exercise.

 Spread your favorite peanut butter over your favorite bread. Then simply replace the jelly with your caramelized apples! Caramelize 1 apple to make 2 sandwiches., Combine ½ cup of rolled oats with ½ cup of water, ½ of milk, and ⅛ teaspoon of salt in a saucepan. Turn the heat to medium until the mixture begins to boil. Lower the heat to simmer. Give the oatmeal another 7 minutes on the stove before transferring to a bowl. Top it with 1 apple’s worth of caramelized slices and enjoy., Caramelize 1 apple’s worth of slices to top four pancakes. Use a recipe with maple syrup to complement those pancakes. For extra apple flavor, add chunks of apple plus applesauce to your pancake batter! To make your batter from scratch:Mix your dry ingredients in a large bowl: 1 ½ cups flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, ¼ cup sugar, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon.
In a second bowl, combine your wet ingredients: 1 ½ cups milk, 2 tablespoons melted butter, 2 tablespoons applesauce, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.
Beat one egg into the wet ingredients, then pour them into the dry ingredients, whisking until the batter become thoroughly smooth and wet.
Chop 1 apple into chunks and stir them into the batter.
 Add them to your ice cream while they are still warm. If you are a diehard “cherry on top,” fan, add ½ cup of dried cherries to your 4 apples when you caramelize them. For an even creamier topping, be sure to use a recipe with whipping cream to caramelize them.

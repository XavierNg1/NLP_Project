 Peel one banana and place it in a blender along with 1/2 cup (120 ml) of almond or soy milk. Add 1 scoop of mocha-flavored protein powder and 3 tablespoons of hemp hearts. Dump 2 cups (434 g) of ice cubes into the blender.You can use any vegan milk you'd like. For an extra chocolate flavor, consider using chocolate hemp milk.
 Put the lid on the blender and blend the frappuccino for about 20 to 30 seconds or until it's completely smooth. The frappuccino should foam up. Pour the frappuccino into your serving glass., If you want to make a dairy-free topping, rinse your blender out and place 1/4 cup (60 ml) of thick, coconut cream into it. Put the lid on the blender and blend the cream until it's lightened and smooth. If the cream is too thick to get out of the blender, you may need to blend in 1 teaspoon of almond milk to loosen it.The cream will whip the best if it's very cold and thick.
 Immediately spoon the coconut cream topping onto the frappuccino. You can dust the top of the smoothie with a little cocoa powder or mocha-flavored protein powder. Stick a straw in the frappuccino and enjoy.

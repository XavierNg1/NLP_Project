 For this smoothie you need a total of 1 cup of fruit. Slice a banana and chop strawberries so that you have a pile of fruit that adds up to a cup.


If you like a strong banana flavor with a hint of strawberries, plan on using more banana; if you prefer a lighter smoothie with a little banana flavor, go heavier on the strawberries instead.You can freeze the strawberries and banana beforehand for an icier smoothie.;
, Strawberries and bananas may be sweet enough for you by themselves, but some people like a little extra sweetness. You can add a teaspoon of regular sugar or go with honey or agave nectar for a delicious flavor.
 You need a cup of plain, vanilla-flavored, or other fruity-flavored yogurt, depending on your preference. Get either whole milk or skim milk yogurt. The more fat the yogurt has, the thicker and richer the smoothie will taste.
 Place the yogurt, the fruit, and the sweetener in a blender or food processor. Blend the ingredients until they are fully incorporated and no large chunks of fruit remain.


Check out the texture of the smoothie. If you want to thin it out, add a few tablespoons of milk and continue blending.
You can add some ice cubes to cool the smoothie down and give it an icier texture.
 Pour it into a glass so you can see its pretty pink color. Refrigerate if you won't be drinking it immediately.

 If you are having trouble using one of the methods above, you can always copy and paste your fraction from another document or from the internet.
 If the fraction you want to use appears somewhere else in the document, or perhaps in a different document, then you can quickly copy and paste it.


Highlight the fraction you want to use with your cursor.
Right click on the highlighted text and click "copy".
Click back to the document and place the cursor where you want the text to appear. Right click again, and click "paste".
If the text doesn't match the format of the document you are working in, highlight the newly pasted fraction, and change the font and font size to that of the text in the document.
 If you do not have the fraction handy in a different document, you can find it on a web page by searching for the fraction + the word "fraction". For example, if you want to include 1/10, search for "1/10 fraction".


Click through the results until you find the fraction you are looking for. Then, as above, highlight the fraction, and copy and paste it into your document.
If you need to change the formatting, highlight the fraction again and then change it to the correct font and font size. You may also need to make it bold (or regular) when necessary.

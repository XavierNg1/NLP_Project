 Also called a step vault, the safety vault is the best jumping technique for beginners.This jump can be done from a stationary, walking, or running start. If you’re intimidated by the idea of running towards the fence, do the jump from a walking or standing position.


This jump works best for waist-high obstacles. If the fence is too high, you may trip or have trouble clearing the fence.
Clear any debris from around the fence. If you land on debris you may twist an ankle.;
, Absolute beginners should use two hands. If you’re confident that you’re strong enough to guide yourself over the fence, use one hand. Lean forward, supporting your weight with your arms.If you’re nervous about jumping over the fence, test yourself holding yourself up for a few seconds. This will help you gauge your own strength.
 First, hop into the air. While airborne, place the ball of your foot against the top of the fence. This foot will help you balance and allow you to propel yourself off the fence.


The faster you approach the fence, the more important this foot is for balance.
 Curl your free leg against your body and bring your knee towards your chest. Guide your foot over the fence, using your outside foot for balance. As you move your leg, lift the hand closest to your legs away from the fence. This will give you more space to maneuver your legs.Keep your shoulders and head down as you move. Otherwise, your feet may catch on the edge of the fence and you’ll fall over.
 Push off slightly with your resting foot to help move yourself away from the fence. Your free foot will hit the ground first, followed by your resting foot. If possible, land on the balls of your feet to reduce the risk of injury.


Point your feet and knees forward as you land. If you don’t, you may twist an ankle.
Bend your knees as you land. This will help you avoid knee injuries.

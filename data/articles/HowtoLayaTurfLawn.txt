 Some might make the mistake of believing that they can simply spread rolls of turf over any type of lawn. Preparation is crucial when it comes time to lay a turf lawn.

Get rid of any weeds. Use a strong weed killer, if needed.



 


Remove large rocks, stones, tree roots, old turf and any other possible debris from the ground.






Cultivate the soil with a spade to a depth of about 6 inches (15.2 cm).






Level the ground with a rake. Add topsoil if needed. Stamp down the area with your feet, and then rake again. Slope the ground gently away from the house and any other structure, such as sheds, decks or patios.






Spread a fertilizer over the prepared ground.

, Pound wooden stakes into the ground at each corner of the yard and use string or builder’s line to outline where you will be placing the turf.
 Start with a single roll of turf and unroll it so the longest side is parallel to the longest edge of the lawn.

Stagger each roll of turf as you go along to avoid a single line of edges or joints across the lawn. Some compare staggering turfs to the way you would stagger bricks when putting up a brick wall.






Use a knife or blade to cut the rolls of turf as needed.






Butt one edge of turf up against another. Use a rake to pull edges close to one another. Do not overlap turfs.
 Cut pieces of turfs you have trimmed to fill in large gaps. Also repair any hollow spots under turfs by lifting and filling with topsoil.
 It is recommended that the first watering should soak the layer of topsoil or ground the turf is installed upon.
 It is not necessary to soak the topsoil after the first watering, as this can cause soil damage. Cut back on the frequency of watering once you can pull up on a turf without it lifting.

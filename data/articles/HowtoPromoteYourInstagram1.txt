 The more that you interact with accounts on Instagram, the more engagement you'll ultimately get. Instead of just liking posts, make it a point to leave a meaningful comment. This will encourage other users to comment on your content and could entice people to visit you. Following people will also result in other people following you back, so make sure to follow profiles you think are interesting., Tell your friends that you have an Instagram account and tell them to follow you. Include your Instagram handle on emails or on your personal blog. The more that people can recognize your handle and see that you have an account, the more likely they are to visit it., Make sure to include your Instagram handle on different social media accounts like Twitter, Facebook, or even dating apps like Tinder. This will get your Instagram account instant exposure. Those that aren't currently following you have a greater chance of finding your Instagram., One good way to engage users is to hold a photo contest. Think of photos that relate to your profile, then encourage contestants to put a specific hashtag on the post. Go through the photos and choose the best ones to display on your blog or on your Instagram. This will get your followers more invested in your content and will get more people to interact and view your profile.Good prizes for the contest include recognition, free merchandise, or tickets to a show.
 Not all content on Instagram has to be your own. You can also look at your feed and find things that you find interesting or unique. Try to repost content as soon as it comes out. Reposting content that your audience has already seen will likely result in lower engagement.

 Applying a clear topcoat can help to strengthen and protect your nails while you are growing them. Try applying a layer or two of topcoat to your nails a few times per week while you are growing them. Some topcoats are specifically meant to help strengthen and harden your nails. If your nails are brittle or bend easily, then try using some nail hardening topcoat., If your nails never seem to grow, then you might benefit from a nail growth gel. These gels protect and nourish your nails, which will encourage more nail growth.Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for the product you purchase.
 Keeping your hands and nails moisturized may also help to encourage growth. Try keeping a bottle of hand lotion with you at all times and apply it a few times throughout the day.For example, you could keep a bottle of hand lotion in your purse, on your desk, or next to your bed.
 If you have noticed that your nails are weak and brittle, then try switching to an acetone-free nail polish remover for a while.


Check the label to see if the nail polish remover is acetone-free.

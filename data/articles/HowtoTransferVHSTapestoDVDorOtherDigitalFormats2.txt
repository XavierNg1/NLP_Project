 While these will generally lack High-Def outputs and software packages, it's still the least-complciated way to transfer a VHS tape to DVD.


A new combo player will probably run between $100-$200, but will probably be available for cheaper on eBay or craigslist.
Alternatively, you can connect a separate VHS player to a DVD player with recording capabilities. For this, you'll need a regular set of two-directional Audio-Visual cables. Plug the outputs from the VHS player into the inputs from the DVD player and follow the rest of the instructions as if you were using a combo player.
 Depending on the quality of your VHS tapes, this can be either an over-cautious step or a necessary one. If you're working with old irreplaceable family tapes or extremely dirty tapes you'll want to make sure that you're not going to ruin them by running them through the player.


Roll the protective tab back to reveal the magnetic tape. Forward the tape by turning the spindles and wiping the tape with a soft cloth or piece of cotton.
If the tape is wrinkled or twisted, gently smooth it with the cloth. Turn the spindles the other way to run the tape out if it's severely twisted. Be very careful.
 Check the player's specifications about DVD formats, whether or not it will write over DVD-R discs or DVD-RW and make sure you've got the right kind of disc for your player.
 This process will vary depending upon your machine, but typically you'll need to press play on the VHS controls and hit record on the DVD controls. Often, though, there will be a single "record" button that engages the transfer process automatically.

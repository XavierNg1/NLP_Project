 This is the most obvious solution. Constantly watch your sporkee to see if they forgot their spork. They are most vulnerable, after work, church, or walking to their car. Feel free to memorize their schedule to find them at any and all times. Spork them.;
, Fork their lawn, with sporks. Hide near by and drop them an anonymous text about their sporked lawn. When they come outside... a) if they don't have their spork on them, spork them right then. b) When they go to clean up the "forks" they will really then be holding 2 sporks. Spork them.
 Go behind your sporkee, and throw a spork in their sweatshirt hood. They will wonder what random object you put in their hood, and when they reach back to get it, they will be holding two sporks. Spork them.
 If it is someone's birthday, or if you are in school and need to bring in food, this is an opportunity. This can work for most foods, but this example is for cake. Cut the pieces out and put them on paper plates with forks like always, only place the fork in the cake so you can't see the top of it. Stick a spork in your victim's cake, and when they reach for their cake, they now have two. Spork them.
 Put the spork in a backpack pocket of your victim, or in their folder. When they accidentally hold it and or reach for it, spork them.
 Get a freshman or younger kid to hold a spork, and go up to your victim saying "you dropped this." Their first instinct will be to just grab it, and that's where you will be standing right behind them as they take the second spork. Spork them.

 All Draw objects have associated invisible gluepoints. Most objects have four gluepoints.


Note: Gluepoints are not the same as the little blue or green “handles” of an object. You use the handles to move or change the shape of an object, but the gluepoints are used to “glue” a connector to an object.;
, It will probably be around the center of it. Once clicked on, it will bring up another gluepoint toolbar so that you can add and subtract them.
 They become visible if you click the Gluepoints icon.
 Connectors are very useful in drawing organization charts, flow diagrams and mindmaps. Even when objects are moved or reordered, the connectors remain attached.
 Hold down the mouse button and select the desired gluepoint for the other end. As you can see, it doesn't always take the expected route.

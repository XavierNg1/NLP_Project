 They must be in good condition and either medium to large in size.
 Pierce with a fork a few times per potato, to allow steam to escape during cooking.
 Place in the microwave and cook on high for 7 to 8 minutes. During this time, turn the potatoes at least once.
 Allow to cool slightly, then cut the potatoes in half. Hold with a fork if they're too hot to handle safely.


While the potatoes are cooling slightly, preheat the oven to 375ºF/190ºC.
 Using a kitchen knife, score down the middle (length) of the potato half, then score across the width at even intervals to create cube shapes that sit in the skin. Do not cut the potato flesh away from the skin, and do not cut the skin; you are aiming to keep all of the flesh cubes intact, inside the skin shell.
 Place the scored potato halves side by side on a baking sheet (add parchment paper first, if wished).
 In a small saucepan, melt the stick of butter. Add the garlic powder and lemon juice. Stir to combine well.
 Sprinkle with salt and pepper. If you wish to use additional seasonings, such as herbs, chicken seasoning, etc., sprinkle this over the top after basting.
 Bake for about 10 minutes or until the topping of the potatoes has turned a golden brown and looks nice.
 Turn on the broiler (top-down grill) and broil (grill) for just long enough for the Parmesan to brown.

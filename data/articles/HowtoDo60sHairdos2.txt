 Comb forward your bangs or the hair at the top of your forehead. Use a straightening iron if you have one to get the section completely straight. Pull the section over to the right side of your forehead, then hold it against the side of your head and pin it into a spiral-shaped curl at the hairline. Take the rest of your hair and put it in a high ponytail. Pull at the top of your hair a little to give it some extra volume, then take the ends of your ponytail, twist them around the hair tie and pin them to make a high, elegant bun.This is a great look to use on long or medium length natural hair.
 To do a simple hippie hairstyle, wear your hair natural without any product.

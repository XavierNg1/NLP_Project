 You will need several tools in order to create potions, as well as a source of water. You can create these tools using the Crafting Table.


Brewing Stand - This tool is required to brew potions. You can create it by placing three Cobblestone Blocks on the bottom row of the Crafting Grid, and a single Blaze Rod in the center of the grid.
Cauldron - A Cauldron is not required for crafting potions, but can be useful for keeping your water nearby while you're brewing, each Cauldron can hold a Bucket of water, which can fill three Bottles. You can craft a Cauldron by placing seven Iron Ingots around the edge of the Crafting Grid, leaving the top-center and middle squares empty.
Glass Bottles - Glass Bottles are required to hold your potions. You can sometimes get Glass Bottles from defeating Witches or by fishing, or you can craft them by placing three Glass Blocks in the Crafting Grid; one in the bottom-center square, one in the left-middle square, and one in the right-middle square. Crafting Glass Bottles will create three at a time.;
, Nether Wart is the primary ingredient for nearly all of the potions in Minecraft. The only potion that doesn't use Nether Wart as an ingredient is the Potion of Weakness.


Nether Wart grows in the Nether, and can be found in some Nether Forts, especially around staircases.
Nether Wart can be planted in Soul Sand to grow. This is essential if you intend to create a lot of potions, and can save you a lot of foraging time.
 Base potions don't have any effects, and need to have another ingredient added to make them do something. The ingredients you choose will dictate what kind of potion you create.


Spider Eye - Dropped by Spiders, Cave Spiders, and Witches. Used for poison potions.
Glistering Melon - You can craft a glistening melon by surrounding a Melon with eight Gold Nuggets in the Crafting Grid. Used for instant health potions.
Golden Carrot - Can be crafted by surrounding a single Carrot with eight Gold Nuggets in the Crafting Grid. Used for night-vision potions.
Blaze Powder - Can be crafted by crafting a single Blaze Rod, dropped by Blaze enemies. This will produce two Blaze Powders. Used for strength potions.
Fermented Spider Eye - Can be crafted from a Spider Eye, Mushroom, and Sugar. Used for weakness potions.
Pufferfish - Can be caught by fishing. Used for water-breathing potions.
Magma Cream - Dropped by defeated Magma Cubes, and can be crafted by combining Blaze Powder and a Slimeball. Used for fire resistance potions.
Sugar - This can be crafted from single pieces of Sugar Cane. Used for speed potions.
Ghast Tear - Dropped by Ghasts. Can be difficult to obtain since Ghasts tend to hover over lava. Used for health regeneration potions.
Rabbit’s Foot - Dropped by defeating Rabbits (2.5% drop rate). Used for leaping potions. This is only available in 1.8

, You can further modify a potion by adding another ingredient after it is created. This will usually increase the amount of time the potion is active. You can also make potions throwable so that they splash on impact.


Redstone - You can find Redstone by mining Redstone Ore. This will typically yield 4-5 Redstone. This can make potions last longer.
Glowstone Dust - Can be obtained by breaking a block of Glowstone. You can receive up to four Glowstone Dusts per block of Glowstone. This can make potions stronger, but shorter.
Gunpowder - This can be found by defeating Creepers, Ghasts, and Witches. This makes potions throwable.
Fermented Spider Eye - This secondary ingredient can also be used to further modify potions. It typically reverses or corrupts the effects of the potion.
 All potions start with a Glass Bottle filled with Water. Fill three of your bottles from a water source. You can make three potions from one secondary ingredient, so make sure you are always being efficient and creating three potions at a time.
 This will open the Brewing Grid. There will be one square at the top, connected to three squares underneath. Place your water-filled Glass Bottles in the bottom three square.
 Place a Nether Wart in the top square of the Brewing Grid. The brewing process will begin, which 20 seconds. After the process is complete, your Glass Bottles will be filled with Awkward Potion. The Awkward Potion does not do anything, but is used as the base for actual potions.


If you are trying to make a Potion of Weakness, add any of the secondary ingredients listed in the previous section instead of the Nether Wart to make a Mundane Potion. This is the base for a Potion of Weakness. Adding a Fermented Spider Eye instead of a Nether Wart to immediately create a Potion of Weakness without the need of a base potion.

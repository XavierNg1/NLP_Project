 You can schedule your event to start later, or you can start the stream immediately.
 Public events can be found and viewed by anyone, Unlisted events can only be accessed if the person has a link, and Private videos are restricted to specific people who must be logged in with their Google+ accounts.
 This will enable the Google Hangouts on Air, which just uses the Hangouts plugin and your webcam. The "Custom" option is for more elaborate events and requires your own encoding program. Click here for more details.
 Click the "Advanced settings" tab and review all of the options. You can change your comment preferences, age restrictions, statistics, broadcast delay, and more.
 If you don't have the Google+ plugin installed, you will be prompted to install it.
 The Hangouts window will launch and your webcam will activate. You will see a percentage start increasing at the bottom of the screen. Once this reaches a certain amount, you will be able to start broadcasting.
 You are allowed to broadcast for up to eight hours.
 This will allow you to mute or kick people that are being disruptive to your broadcast.
 Click the "Links" button at the bottom of the Hangouts windows to see the sharing and embedding information. The short URL will allow you to share the broadcast through Twitter and other social media, and the embed code allows you to easily add the video to your blog.


The video will also be prominently displayed on your YouTube Channel page.

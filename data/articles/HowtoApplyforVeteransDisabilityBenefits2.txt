 If visiting a VA office is not feasible, then you can also download the required paperwork and mail it in. Forms can be downloaded from the VA Forms website at http://www.va.gov/vaforms/. You may also call VA at 1-800-827-1000 to have forms mailed to you. You will need the following forms:VA Form 21-536c, Pre-Discharge Compensation Claim
VA Form 21-536EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits
VA Form 21-4142, Authorization and Consent to Release Information to the Department of Veterans Affairs (if you received treatment from a non-VA health care provider)

, You should print neatly to complete the forms. You can also insert information directly into the PDF. Save and then print off the form.
 After you complete your forms, make copies of them for your records. Also make copies of any evidence (such as medical reports) that you submit with your application. Retain the originals in case you need to use them again.


Mail the completed forms to your nearest VA Regional Office. You can find the mailing address on the Facility Locator page.

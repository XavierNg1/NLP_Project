 Your base is going to need a backbone, and that backbone has to be the heart of your operation. You are going to want a common material, such as wood block or cobblestone. You are going to reinforce this later, so what you choose is what you are going to see, not what is going to be exposed, so whatever material you want to see is what you should choose.
 You aren't going to be able to go back up to kill a few pigs every time you get hungry, so you are going to need a farmable source of food. The most preferable source of food would be potatoes, as every baked potato can heal 2 and a half hearts, and you can get several per plant. However, things like wheat, melons, and even carrots can be used as food.

If the server you are playing on has the option to get spawners, those can be placed in a 10x10 room with grass for an infinite amount of food and experience. The best would be cows, as they can drop leather and raw beef, the leather can be used to make books and armor in a pinch, and the beef could be used for food

, Your purpose here is to minimize the amount of time needed to spend in the overworld, as people can simply follow you back to your base afterward. A list of such items follows, but any item that you might find necessary should also be included

2 buckets of water. This is to create an infinite source of water by putting 2 blocks of water diagonally from each other in a 2x2 square to get infinite water.
Saplings. This is so you can get more wood underground in case you run out in your adventures.
Wool. This is to make a bed so that you can respawn in your base in the off chance that you die.
Dirt. This is so you can plant your saplings and seeds and get your farm going.

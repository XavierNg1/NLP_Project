 Log into Outlook.com (Formerly Hotmail and Windows Live mail) and start a new email. Ensure that the recipient address is correct, and type whatever you'd like in the Subject and Body.


You can start a new email by clicking the "New" button at the top of the page.;
, Click the "Insert" button at the top of the page and select "Files as attachments". You can then browse your computer for the video file that you want to send. Select it to add it to the email.


In order to attach a video using this method, the file must exist on your computer. To share a YouTube video, you'll need to link to it.
 Outlook.com has a file size limit of 10 MB, which is too small for most video files. You can use compression software to compress the video file to a smaller size. Your recipient will then need to uncompress the file in order to view the video.


Both Windows and Mac allow you to compress files without any additional software, but you can use third-party programs to get better compression and smaller files. See this guide for details.
If your file is still too large to attach, see the next method to share the file using your OneDrive account.

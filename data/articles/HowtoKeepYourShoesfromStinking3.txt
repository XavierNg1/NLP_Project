 If fungus or bacteria is what's causing your feet and shoes to smell, it's a good idea to attack the smell at the source. Every day when taking a shower, give both of your feet a good, sudsy wipe-down with antimicrobial or antibacterial soap.


Find out if washing your feet every day with antimicrobial soap will dry them out. Washing them every day might leave them dry and cracked. If your feet get dry, moisturize them with after washing and consider washing your feet with antimicrobial wash every other day.
 This might sound weird, but keep in mind that your feet sweat too. Buy a stick of deodorant that is meant only for your feet (that is, don't use it anywhere else) and apply it every morning.

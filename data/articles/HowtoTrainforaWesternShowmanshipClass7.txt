 Getting another person to walk around the horse and you, change from side to side in front of the horses head. At this point it doesn't need to be accurate, just to allow the horse to get accustomed to the sudden changes of position. After about 6 changes, finish on the near side and then stand facing forward, and get the horse to walk off.

 If you don't have one already, there are several ways to get one:Craft one from 3 sticks and 3 pieces of string. (String can be obtained from spiders.)
Skeletons have a small chance to drop a bow when killed.
Fishing has a small chance to snag a bow.
Fletcher villagers will give you a bow in exchange for emeralds.
 If a nearby creeper surprises you, turn and run. The advantage to using the bow is killing the creeper from well outside its blast radius, so there's no danger of it exploding next to you.


Climbers will sometimes follow you upward if you climb, so make sure you have an escape route before jumping up a tree.
 Three hits should be the most you need to kill a creeper in Normal mode, assuming you draw the bow back far enough.
 If you keep a large stack of dirt in your quick item slots, drop them rapidly underneath you while jumping and you'll soon create a dirt tower. From here you can safely shoot creepers below you, as long as you are at least six blocks above it (eight blocks above the ground).
 Protect your shelter by making a hole beneath your windows, so you can crouch and shoot arrows. Alternatively, make a roof outpost where you can shoot anything that comes near.
 If you have access to an enchantment table, you might try enchanting your bow. Depending on the enchantment, this could increase your bow's damage, knock your targets further back, set your targets on fire, or give you unlimited arrows.

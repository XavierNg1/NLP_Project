 Many formal gardens have fountains, koi ponds, small streams, and other water features to add interest to the layout. Consider installing a water feature in your garden, either as the focal point or a simple decoration.
 Concrete is often used in formal garden designs in the form of urns, other plant holders, and statues. Marble is another classic stone you could use, or faux-marble if you're looking for a more affordable option.


One beautiful statue used as the centerpiece of your garden can make a huge difference. Check out garden stores and nurseries for outdoor statue options.
If you decide to use urns, buy an even number and distribute them around the garden in a pattern. For example, if your garden is divided into four sections, each one should have an urn, and the urns should all contain the same kind of plant or flower.
 If your formal garden is in your backyard, chances are you'll want to spend a lot of time out there. You'll need outdoor furniture that matches the theme of your garden.


Wrought iron is often a good choice for this purpose. You could also choose a different material and spray paint it either dark green or black to match the garden.
Avoid plastic furniture, since a formal garden should look timeless.
 Formal gardens need more maintenance than other types of gardens, especially if you have hedges that need to be trimmed to keep a certain shape. Take care of your garden throughout the summer and give it touch-ups over the winter as you prepare for spring.


Use an edger to trim the grass away from your paths.
Weed your garden frequently to keep plants healthy and your garden looking neat.
After watering and working in the garden, put away the hose and gardening tools.
Sweep leaves and dirt off of the paths frequently.

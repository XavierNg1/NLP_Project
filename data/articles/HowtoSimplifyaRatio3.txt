 Polynomial ratios are more complex than other ratio types. There are still two quantities being compared, but the factors of those quantities are not as obvious and the problem may take slightly longer to solve. Nonetheless, the basic principle and steps remain the same.



Example: (9x2 - 8x + 15) : (x2 + 5x - 10)

, You'll need to factor out the polynomial of the first quantity. There are multiple methods you can use to complete this step, so you will need to use your knowledge of quadratic equations and other complex polynomials to determine the best method to use.



Example: For this problem, you can use the decomposition method of factorization.

x2 - 8x + 15
Multiply the a and c terms together: 1 * 15 = 15
Find two numbers that equal this number when multiplied and add up to the value of the b term: -5, -3 Substitute these two numbers into the original equation: x2 - 5x - 3x + 15
Factor by grouping: (x - 3) * (x - 5)



, The second quantity of the ratio must be broken down into factors, as well.



Example: Use any method desired to break down the second expression into factors:
x2 + 5x - 10

(x - 5) * (x + 2)



, Note that a factor, in this application, is any expression set in parentheses. If any of the parenthetical factors are the same between the two sides of your ratio, those factors can be canceled out.



Example: The factored form of the ratio is written as: : The common factor between the numerator and denominator is: (x-5)
When the common factor is removed, the ratio can be rewritten as: (x-5)*, The final ratio should contain no additional like factors and should be equivalent in proportion to the original ratio.



Example: (x – 3) : (x + 2)

 Search your library’s online catalog for the book you want to borrow. To narrow your search, you can filter search results to include digital download books only.
 Although the standard borrowing window is 21 days, some Overdrive accounts give you the option of choosing a shorter time period, such as seven or fourteen days. Select the time period that best fits your needs.


If you know you are a slow reader, only check out one digital book at a time so you don’t keep other patrons waiting.
 Overdrive offers a few downloading options, depending on the reader you are using. Options should include a computer PDF format, a Kindle format, and a Nook format.


The Nook format might also read “EPUB” or something similar.

 Begin rubbing the top of the foot, slowly working your way down to the sole of the foot. Apply more pressure as you get closer to the sole. Reverse directions and rub the foot moving slowly towards the top, reducing pressure as you go.
 Use your thumbs for this, making small circles with medium to heavy pressure. Work your way around the entire heel. Repeat this action on the ball of the foot.
 This means you use your thumbs to push up and down on the heel. While one thumb is pushing up, the other should be pushing down.
 Use both hands to rub in a circular motion around the bone on either side, and gently rub your fingers over the top of the bone.
 With your hand closed in a fist, use the tops of your fingers to apply pressure to the arch. Roll your hand back and forth to knead the skin gently.
 Spend time on each individual toe.









Go to each toe and gently pull on it. This may cause the joint to pop, but unless it causes the person discomfort, continue to do this to each toe.
Slide your index finger in the gap between each toe. Spend time moving it back and forth, rubbing the base of each toe with your index and thumb if desired.
Gently slide all five fingers between each of the toes simultaneously, while rubbing a small amount of massage oil or cream between each one.

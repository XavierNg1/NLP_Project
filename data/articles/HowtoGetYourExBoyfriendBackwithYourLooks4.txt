 That's good news. That means he didn't leave you for someone else.


Try asking him directly what went wrong.
Tell him you still care about him, but don't ask him back out.
 Tell him that you're happy for him. Be nice. When things go wrong between them, he'll come running back to you.


Don't badmouth the new girl he's seeing. Be classy.

 If you are debating with facts and figures then those things speak for themselves. When it comes to matters of personal opinion, you absolutely must acknowledge that a girl’s opinion is as valid as your own. The fact that she is a girl does not make her any less intelligent or able to form a coherent opinion. You are allowed to disagree with her, but you also have to respect her point of view., If you disagree with a girl, stick to the facts. Dismissing her opinion by saying something like “Well of course you think that, you’re a girl,” is completely disrespectful. If you have a reason to disagree with her, state that reason with facts (or as your own opinion), but do not belittle her for being a girl.For example, if you think that a Lamborghini is superior to a Ferrari and she disagrees, present the stats for each car. Do not say something like “This just goes to show girls know nothing about cars.”

, If you respect someone, you value their opinion. Ask a girl for her opinion on things regularly to show that you care what she thinks. You can agree or disagree, but you should show genuine interest and consideration in her point of view.For example, you might ask you should ask her where she wants to go on a Friday night rather than assume that she’ll want to do whatever you decide.

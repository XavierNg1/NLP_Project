 The most basic and straightforward of all the closing tactics, a direct close is simply asking for your customer’s final answer. Although it doesn’t have to be blunt, you are looking for the response to your single sale only.
 To do this, you close your sale with an offer for a discount or additional product at a reduced price. This will not only help to solidify your current sale, but possibly gain you additional sales as well.
 If your client seems interested in your product, remove their hesitation by offering a test period for your product. This could be a number of days or a sample of whatever it is you’re selling. If they get a chance to use it and find it has value for them, you’ve secured your sale and opened the possibility of more in the future., In this, you show that purchasing your product is the only good outcome. You show how not buying from you may be detrimental in the long run, or how similar product or services don’t have nearly as high of standing as yours does.
 Close by demonstrating how much your product or service costs on a daily basis. This number will likely be low and seem very reasonable to your client, inciting their interest in purchasing it from you.
 Show that by purchasing your product or service, your audience is particularly intelligent, logical, helpful, et cetera. This will give them a self-esteem boost, leaving you both on a high note.

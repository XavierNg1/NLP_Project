 When taking body measurements, you need to use the correct type of tape measure. You will want to use a soft cloth or flexible plastic/rubber tape measure, such as is used in sewing. Do not use a metal measuring tape such as is used in construction (it will be inaccurate).;
, Stand straight, tall, and breathe normally when taking measurements. Some measurements may be taken better when exhaling, some when inhaling (it will depend on the purpose of the measurement). This may be difficult to do yourself, so get a friend to help you.
 You want to be sure that when you measure, the tape is straight and in line with the appropriate body part. For example, for most circumference measurements the tape will need to be parallel to the floor while while lengths will need to be either parallel or perpendicular (based on the line orientation of the body part being measured).
 You canâ€™t get a very accurate measurement when wearing baggy or thick clothing, so try to wear clothes which fit closely or wear nothing at all. Similarly, breast measurements for women will be most accurate when wearing a well-fitting, unpadded bra.


If measuring for clothes tailoring, some measurements will need to be taken with clothing on, such as pants measurements and shoulder measurements.
 Different measurements will need to be either circumference measurements (the measurement around something) or length measurements (the measurement between two straight points). Which is necessary should be obvious but all will be indicated in the instructions below.
 Make sure that you write down the measurements as you take them, so that you do not forget them and need to take them again.

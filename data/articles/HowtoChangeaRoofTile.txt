 The most common tile types are concrete and terracotta.


You must ensure it is the same type of tile or it may not work and can result in damage even though you've tried to repair it. If you don't know what the tile is, take a tile with you to a roofing supplier and they should be able to match it for you.;
, Only do this if you know it can be done safely, using a stable ladder and perhaps even using climbing ropes to protect you in case of a fall, particularly with a roof that has a steep incline or is slippery. If you don't have a head for heights or you're not sure about how safe it is for you to get on the roof, call in a professional. Falling off a roof can be deadly.
 Do this using two pieces of timber to hold them up. Then, use a brick trowel to lift up the broken over the baton underneath and slide it down and out.
 Be sure to place the overlapping tiles back into position.
 Unless you're in a high wind area, the tile won't need to be nailed or wired into place. Check that all tiles are sitting properly.
 It's a good idea to know how well the roof is holding up in case any other tiles need replacing.

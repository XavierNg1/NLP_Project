 Since the enemies are headcrabs and mindless zombies, they make noise. If you listen carefully, you won't be surprise-attacked.;
, There are three zombie and headcrab types. Normal zombies, the most common, are slow moving, and say things muffled by the headcrab. Skeletal zombies are thin and very fast and make high pitched howling when at a distance, and ferocious gasping noises when nearby. Poison zombies are slow, hard to kill and throw venomous headcrabs at you. They make aggressive grunts.
 throw barrels, saw blades and exploding barrels.
 Saw blades, when used with the gravity gun, are extremely effective for killing zombies, try to carry one or two saw blades as far as you can through the chapter before ditching one.
 If you don't, the headcrab will survive and attack you

, Common headcrabs and thin headcrabs (both flesh colored) require four hits from the gravity gun's primary fire to be killed, venomous headcrabs (black with red and white rings on the legs) need three to kill.
, The venomous headcrabs are larger, black, and move slowly compared to the thin headcrabs, which have similar proportions, but move much more quickly.
 The zombies will throw things at you, so be careful. Physics objects hurt more than bullets.
 Reload whenever you have a break, and aim for the head.

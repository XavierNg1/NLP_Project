, Make sure you don't sound rushed or panicked as if this was a last minute idea you came up with, but appear as if the person has all the time in the world to choose and you wouldn't care how long he/she took.


If the person appears scared or panicked, you have the choice of either pursuing the idea or backing off.

If you choose the pursue the idea, gently mention, "It's fine if you say no. It's your choice."
If you decide to back off, laugh, "Just kidding! You should have seen the look on your face!" To lighten things up even more, gently punch the person in the arm if he is a guy. If you were asking a girl to the dance, poke her in the arm or - if you're daring enough - wink at her.


If the person accepts, resist the urge to hop around while screaming at the top of your lungs for pure joy. Smile at him/her and say, "That's great. I'll see you at the dance then!"

Avoid bragging to your friends about achieving your goal because the person could find out and grow angry and/or hurt. Your boasting could be misinterpreted, and people may believe you were only completing a deal and/or using the person.

 It can be helpful to have options readily available to curb the impulse to buy ready-made snacks and dinners.


Many ready-made snacks are high in calories and sodium and very low in nutrients. Buying fast food for lunch or dinner has the same issue—it fills the child up without supplementing their diet with the nutrients they need. It is ok to have fast food or junk food every once in a while, but plan for it and you will be less likely to splurge too often.
 For example, instead of fried with a sandwich, prepare apple slices for your child’s lunch, and choose milk instead of soda.
 Cutting vegetables and fruits and pre-portioning them is a great way to help save time.
 Rice and pasta hold well in the refrigerator when made in advance but whole wheat pasta tends to dry out, so store it with a little extra water to keep it from drying out too much.
 A small food scale can be purchased for under $10 at most stores and will make it easier to portion meat.
 By getting your child involved, they get to feel like they accomplished something. It also helps get them familiar with any new foods in advance so that when it is time to eat, they won’t be surprised. This can make mealtime a fun time to look forward to.

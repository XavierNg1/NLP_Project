 Request a "short fade" hair style at your barber's. This style will allow you to style your hair like Daniel Craig at home. The short fade style means your hair will start off longer near the top of your head and gradually get shorter as your barber works their way down the sides.A short fade helps emulate Craig because of the style Craig usually wears his hair. His hair frames his face by making a round curve near the top his head that fades out slightly towards his temples. This frames his face and softens his features.;
, Request your barber cut your hair between one and one point five centimeters (about .4 and .6 of an inch) on the sides. On the top of your head, request the length be around 2 centimeters (about .8 of an inch).It can also help to let your barber know you're going for a rounded effect. You want a look that will frame your face, so your hair's length should be reduce gradually as your barber moves from the top of your head to the sides., Texturizing a cut means hairs are cut with minor variations in length. While most of the hair near the top of your head will still be the appropriate two centimeters (.8 of an inch), your barber will cut some hairs shorter or longer here and there. These subtle variations in length create a sense of depth, making thinner, shorter hair look and feel fuller.

 In order for nipples to stay in good shape, they should be used but not abused.A nipple that is overused can get irritated and sore rather quickly. To help alleviate this soreness and help the nipple recover, make sure the puppies are using all nipples equally.


However, a nipple should not be completely abandoned indefinitely. They need to be used to avoid an infection in the ducts.
Positioning puppies away from a sore nipple can be difficult. You will need to keep a close eye on the puppies and mother at all times.;
, If your mother dog is crawled on and active with her puppies between feedings, her nipples may be getting irritated unnecessarily. Instead of letting this occur, try putting a dog shirt or sweater on the mother between feedings in order to protect her nipples.


This will allow the mother to remain with her puppies while not allowing them to injure her further.
Remember that you will need to remove the clothing off the mother dog for the puppies' feedings.
 If a mother dog is not fed properly she will not produce enough milk for her puppies.In turn, as the puppies try to get milk that is not there, they will irritate the mother dog's nipples more and more.


If your mother dog is getting irritated nipples, you should assess the mother's nutrition, as well as the development of the puppies. This can help you determine if the mother is producing enough milk.
 If your mother dog's nipples are irritated, a warm compress may ease some of her discomfort. Make sure that the compresses are not too hot, as this can burn the dog's nipples and injure her further.Do not apply lotions or ointments. While it can be tempting to apply something to soothe the mother's nipples, anything you apply to them will go straight into the puppies' systems. With this in mind, avoid introducing a foreign chemical into the puppies' bodies even if you are just trying to ease the discomfort of the mother.

 Do you want your room to look straight out of 'The Little Mermaid'? Do you want dolphins and whales galore? Or are you trying for a more subdued approach?;
, For an underwater theme, you should be looking into greens, blues, beige, creams, light pinks, yellows, etc;. Think of all of the colors commonly found in coral or the ocean!

, Nothing will add an underwater feel to a room more so than textures. Consider a sponge treatment on your walls, or hire a college student to paint something on one wall!

, Having a white ceiling can destroy any themed room. A light beige or cream, that is further mirrored in pillow cases or an area rug can really bring the room together.
 Collect seashells, sand, etc; and keep them in containers or in an empty fish tank in your room! For one step further, perhaps get a fish tank and fill it with your favorite fish! (Note: do not put fish into sand you took from the beach, it can kill the fish)

, A multi colored blue/beige comforter can really tie this room together.
 The more pillows the better! different textures, sizes, colors, shapes... Make your room feel comfortable for you.

 If you have friends or family members who are pregnant or have small children, consider passing your baby and kid items along to them. This way, the items can be used more than once.
 Another way to give a second life to your gently used baby and kid items is to give them away to a local charity. Consider local churches, food banks, and shelters, as well as the well-known national charity organizations.


One of the benefits of giving your items to a charity is that you can be sure they will go to a family in need. This is especially true after a national disaster or other emergency, when many people lose their homes or can no longer afford to purchase necessary clothing and equipment.
Contact organizations to find out what their policies are. Some will even pick up your items for you.
Donâ€™t forget to get a receipt. When you donate valuable items to a charity, you may be able to claim a deduction on your tax return.
 Another alternative is to give your baby and kid items to a local preschool, child care center, or home day care. Depending on individual regulations, these places may want your clothing and equipment.


Many child care centers have a need for baby and toddler clothing, as young children often have accidents and need to be changed.

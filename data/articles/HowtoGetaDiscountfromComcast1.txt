 Comcast currently offers a variety of services; including cable television, internet, home telephone service, a home security system, and technical support for computers.


Often, it is cheaper to have services packaged in "bundles." If you want more than one of the services listed above, there are a number of packages available. Keep in mind, though, that nearly all of the available packages include internet and cable together; there may not be special offers advertised for just home telephone and cable.Examine these deals closely. Some have noted that those that offer some of the best monthly rates also require the longest contracts. If you do not want to be tied down that long, or want to be able to pit competitors against each other again in the near future, a 24 month contract may not be the best plan.;
, This will allow you to determine the best deals being offered for these services, which you will mention to Comcast when you consult them regarding the discount.
 New Comcast customers are often eligible for rates and discounts that may not be available to existing customers.


If the sales representative does not offer you any noteworthy discount, mention the discount offered to you by competitors. In most cases, Comcast will match the discount to acquire you as a customer.
Beware of the fine print. Comcast will often provide offers that match or exceed those of their competitors for only a brief window at the beginning of the contract. If you are paying a "promotional rate" for the first six months, but must sign a two year contract at a higher rate, you may still be paying more to sign with Comcast. They also unilaterally change some rates without warning, so short contracts may always be the best option.

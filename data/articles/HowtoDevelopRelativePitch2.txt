 A triad is three different notes that are each a third apart. Triads form most of the harmonies you will hear in music. The four basic chord triads are: major triads, minor triads, augmented triads, and diminished triads. Each tried is formed by combining certain intervals.Major triads are formed with a pitch, a root, and a note that is a major third above. For example, the C major triad includes the notes C,E, and G.
Minor triads are formed in the opposite of order of a major triad and include a minor third interval and and a major third. For example, C minor triad includes the notes C, Eb, and G. The middle note determines the difference between a major and minor triad.
A diminished triad only uses a minor third interval. For example, a C diminished triad includes the notes C, Eb, and Gb.
An augmented triad only uses major third intervals. For example, C augmented triad includes the notes, C, E, and G#.
Complex chords are made by stacking triads. If you learn the basics, you will be able to progress to more complex sounds.
 Use an instrument, another person, or a website to play chord tones. As you listen to the chord, try to decipher the three different notes that make up the chord. Try to isolate the different sounds in each chord.Visit playingthechanges.com or download MP3 tracks of the chords if you are working on your own.
 After you listen to a chord, sing the notes in each triad. Then, play a different triad and sing the notes. Next, play two triads at the same time, and then sing the 6 notes that you hear.When you begin to combine triads, always break down the sounds into smaller chunks. For example, it may help to play two triads, and only try to find the root note. Then play the same triads and listen for the top note.

 Purchase a premade tank cover or use a piece of fabric to wrap around the toilet tank. Terry cloth, or towel material, is a commonly chosen fabric for this application. The fabric will absorb any condensation that accumulates on the outside of the tank.;
, Place a fan near the toilet, or turn on the bathroom's vent fan to dry out any condensation that forms on the toilet as well as to reduce excess moisture in the air. The moving air will better dry out condensation on toilets that have adequate space between the tank and the wall. If the air has no room to circulate behind and around the tank, it will not be able to evaporate the perspiration. You can also employ a dehumidifier to do the job; however, keep in mind that a bathroom is a moisture-rich environment and the machine may run constantly.
 Turn on your air conditioner to lower the temperature of the air around the toilet to be closer to the temperature of the water in the toilet's tank. This will minimize the condensation-creating action of warm air outside the tank reacting with the cold tank.
 This valve is attached to the cold water line going into the toilet and allows for the connection of a hot water line. This increases the temperature of the water going into the tank, decreasing the difference between the tank and outside air temperatures, thus reducing toilet tank condensation. The intake of hot water can also be shut off when tempering is not needed.
 Working in a similar fashion as the tempering valve, the water in the toilet tank is brought to a more equivalent temperature to the air outside the tank by tempering the water in a separate holding tank first.

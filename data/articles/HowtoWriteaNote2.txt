 These will likely be quick notes that you use to remind them of something or to give a brief message.


Using a technological tool for leaving notes likely will not work when trying to leave a note for someone else, so it is best to choose a pen-and-paper method.
Always have something ready for writing notes, like a small notepad, sticky notes, or some scrap paper.
 As you write the note, be sure to stick to your reminder or message.


Keep it short and simple. It does not necessarily have to be written in complete sentences, but make sure the recipient will understand what it means.
Avoid getting off-topic, especially if it is a reminder note. The recipient may get confused about what you are asking him/her to do if you get off-topic.
Adding a time and/or date to the note will help if it is time-sensitive. This will help the recipient understand when you left the note and how much time he/she has remaining to take care of the task.
 This seems like a common sense suggestion, but sometimes, notes are left in inconvenient places and are never found. Here are some common helpful suggestions.


On the refrigerator or freezer door
On the kitchen counter
On the dining table
On the bathroom counter
In his/her lunchbox
On his/her desk
On the seat of his/her car

, Simply leaving the note is not enough to make sure that your recipient will receive it. You want to follow up with him/her to verify.


If he/she follows up with you first, then there is no need to ask about it again, unless you asked him/her to complete some sort of task that you want to ensure got completed.
Be polite and friendly without being pushy. Asking, “Did you see my note this morning? I hope I left it in a convenient place for you” or “Do you have any questions about my note?” are some examples.

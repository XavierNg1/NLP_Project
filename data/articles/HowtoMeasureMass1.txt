 This simple equation is what you'll use to convert weight into mass (or mass into weight, if you want to). Don't be worried about what the letters mean â€” we'll tell you:


Force is the same thing as weight. Use Newtons (N) as weight.
Mass is what you're solving for, so it may not be defined to begin with. After solving the equation, your mass will be calculated as kilograms (kg).
Acceleration is the same thing as gravity. Gravity is on earth is a constant equaling 9.78 m/s2. If you're measuring gravity on other planets, this constant will be different.;
, Say you're on earth and you're trying to figure out how much mass your 50 kg soapbox racer has.


List your equation. F = m * a.
Fill in your variables and constants. We know that force is the same thing as weight, which is 50 N. We also know that the effect of gravity on earth is always 9.78 m/s2. Plug in both numbers and our equation looks like this: 50 N = m * 9.78 m/s2

Rearrange in order to solve. We can't solve the equation like this. We need to divide 50 kg by 9.78 m/s2 in order to isolate m.
50 N / 9.78 m/s2 = 5.11 kg. A soapbox racer that weighs 50 Newtons on Earth has a mass of about 5 kg, wherever you race it in the universe!

, Learn how to convert mass back into weight using this example. Let's say that you pick up a moon rock on the surface of the Moon (where else?). It has a mass of 1.25 kg. You want to know how much it will weigh when you bring it back to earth.


List your equation. F = m * a.
Fill in your variables and constants. We have mass and we have the gravitational constant. We know that F = 1.25 kg * 9.78 m/s2.
Solve the equation. Because the variable we're looking for is already isolated on one side of the equation, we don't have to do any moving around in order to solve the equation. We simply multiply 1.25 kg by 9.78 m/s2, giving us 12.23 Newtons.

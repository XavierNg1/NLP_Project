Collect a guam herb. Invest in clean guams for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy guams are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming (members only).






Purchase a vial. Acquire water-filled vial packs to save you time (members only). Any unused vials can be stored in your bank for later usage.






Purchase an eye of newt. You can either get individual ones or a pack of 50. You can get them at the Grand Exchange, Magic and select Herblore shops (for a cheaper price than the Grand Exchange), or as a monster drop.
 This will create a "Guam Potion (unf)".
 This will create the attack potion.

 If a stray dog does get into your yard, avoid confronting it. Don’t try to chase it out of your yard on your own, and do not try to touch it. Strays are likely to carry diseases and can be more aggressive than domesticated dogs., If a stray does get into your yard, call your local animal shelter or police department’s animal control unit. Animal control officers and animal shelter employees are specially trained to deal with stray and/or aggressive animals. They can remove the stray from your yard without any injury to themselves or the strays.
 If Animal Control can’t get to your home right away, you can purchase a trap that you bait with food. If a stray wanders back into your yard, and ends up in the trap, you can keep the stray contained until an Animal Control officer or someone from an animal shelter can come get the stray.These traps are generally pretty humane and won’t injure the strays in any way.
 Sometimes strays aren’t homeless dogs at all – they’re just free-roaming dogs that might be owned by your neighbors. See if you can figure out who the owner is – you might be able to see the owner’s phone number on the dog’s collar or you might recognize the dog. Once you know who the dog belongs to, contact the owner and let them know that their dog is frequently in your yard and ask them if they can keep their pet better contained.

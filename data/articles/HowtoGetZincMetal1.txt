 You'll be working with hot objects in an indoor environment. Wear clothing that can cover your bare skin, tie back long hair, and put on safety goggles and thick gloves if you have any. In addition, move any food, drinks, and potentially flammable objects away from your workspace.;
, You will essentially need the following:


United States pennies (minted after 1982)
pliers
a heat-proof container (such as a crucible)
a gas stove.
 You want to make sure that the stove is producing a hot enough temperature to ensure your yield of zinc.
 With the pliers, place the penny on the tip of the flames (which is the hottest part). The penny will soon start to deform and soften. Be ready to get your container out!

, As the penny starts to crumple, the inner layer will start to liquify. Once you're at that stage, carefully hold the penny above the container, and rock it slightly to coax the liquid metal out; this is the zinc metal. You may still have a thin sheet of metal on your pliers; this is the outer copper layer. (It doesn't melt due to the higher melting point.) Keep in mind: the zinc metal is going to be very hot initially.
 This experiment works because current US pennies contain an inner layer of zinc. Zinc has a low melting point, which means that heating up a penny as such can liquefy the metal, allowing for its extraction.

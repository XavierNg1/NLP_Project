 You'll need a side table or nightstand that is at least almost as high as you want your desk to be, MDF or plywood that is as deep as or a few inches deeper than the nightstand and as long as you want your desk to be, and table legs (2 if you can find them at the same height as the nightstand, 2 sets at different heights if you need to add legs to the nightstand to keep them even). You will also need wood glue, decking screws, and corner brackets.


The height of the table legs and the nightstand (+ optional legs) must be equal and at a good height for a desk. Buy wood table legs for the long side that are made of wood so that they can be trimmed to size.
 Cut the wood desktop to the desired size using a circular saw or jigsaw. Sand it when you are done.
 Paint the desk top to the desired color. Spray paint may be the fastest option.
 Attach the long legs to the desk top using decking screws. The legs go only on one side, as the cabinet will act as the other set of legs.
 Add wood glue to the top of the nightstand and then place the desk top with the cabinet centered under the end with no legs.
 Brace the desk top further in place by attaching corner brackets underneath.
 You can paint or add other finishing touches to your new desk. Enjoy!

 At some schools, your shadow buddy will call you on a parent/guardian's phone. They will tell you what to bring, what subjects you will attend, when/where you should come to the school, and everything else you need to know. You can also ask questions if you have any.;
, Don't choose anything too wild or inappropriate, but that doesn't mean you have to dress in all black or something. If your shadow buddy told you any clothing restrictions, make sure to keep those in mind. Also, if you have PE, wear a PE friendly outfit. Lastly, check with your parents about your outfit to make sure they approve.
 Become acquainted with the admissions staff present, then get to know your fellow shadows.
 When your shadow buddy picks you up, be polite and tell a little about yourself, then learn a little about him/her.


If your shadow buddy introduces you to anyone, be polite. You don't need to become BFFs, but a little kindness goes a long way.
 Say hi to the teacher, and do what you would do at any class at your current school. You can feel free to raise your hand when you know something and participate. #*Remember: You are judging the school, not the other way around. However, noticeably rude or impolite behavior could be remembered and reported to admissions.
 Some schools will bring you into the admissions office for an interview. During an interview the tables turn and you are being judged. Respond candidly to questions and don't interrupt. Try to relax and be yourself.
 Compare it to any other schools you've looked at. If you can picture yourself happy there, chances are it might be your school. It might take some time to decide whether or not to apply. You will probably be at this school for a while, so there is no need to be hasty.

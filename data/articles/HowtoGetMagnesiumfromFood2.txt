 Pumpkin and squash seeds are an incredibly good source of magnesium. A ¼ cup (60 mL) of any type of squash seed (without shells) contains a whopping 317 mg, effectively measuring up to daily dose for an adult female who isn’t pregnant., A ¼ cup (60 mL) of Brazil nuts without their shells will provide you 133 mg of magnesium. Similarly, the same amount of sunflower seeds without shells offers 119 mg. The same portion of sunflower seed butter, however, provides twice this amount! Generally, butters made with nuts are great sources of magnesium., Other nuts (all without their shells) can also be good sources of magnesium. A ¼ cup (60 mL) serving of almonds contains about 100 mg, whereas the same serving of cashews provides 90 mg. The same amount of pine nuts contains 70 – 86 mg. The same amount of cashew butter provides 168 mg.A comparable portion of peanuts provides 65 mg. Peanut butter, on the other hand, provides around 100 mg per ¼ cup (60 mL).
Flaxseeds and sesame seeds are especially good sources too. Just 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of flaxseeds provides 111 mg of magnesium, and the same amount of sesame seeds offer 56 – 68 mg.

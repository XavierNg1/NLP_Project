 You can also use paraffin wax, as it is colorless and will work as a waterproofing agent, but it could have toxic fumes as it is a petroleum product. So, it may not be the best choice for waterproofing your childâ€™s clothing.If you use paraffin wax, make sure you do so in a well ventilated room or outside.
 Then, spread out the clothing you are going to waterproof on your work surface.
 To make the wax easier to apply, you can put it in a sunny spot to soften it or place it close to a heat source, such as a radiator, heater, or stove.


The wax does not need to melt, but only become a bit soft.
You can also warm up the clothes to make it easier to apply the wax. Heat them up by throwing them in the dryer for a quick cycle, by using a hair dryer or by ironing them.
 You want to be sure the entire surface of the clothing is covered evenly in wax so make sure you get wax on areas around buttons, zippers, and the edges of the clothing.You can also use your fingers to apply the wax and get it on any hard to reach areas.
 The wax can leave an unpleasant odor, so to make the wax evaporate faster, you can put the clothes in the freezer overnight.

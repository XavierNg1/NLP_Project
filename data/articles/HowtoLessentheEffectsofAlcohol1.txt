 When you consume alcohol it sits in your stomach while it waits to be processed. If you don't have food in there, the alcohol will process faster and at one time. If you have food in your belly, the alcohol will enter your system more slowly and at a varied pace thus lessening the effects of alcohol immediately.This is especially important if you know you will be drinking for a sustained period, like a bar crawl.;
, For the same reason that you want food in your stomach, drinking slowly will allow your body to process the alcohol over a period of time. Whereas, if you inundate your body with alcohol, it will be more difficult to process.
 Choose alcohols with fewer congeners (substances that are also produced during the fermentation process), which are less likely to cause a hangover. Light-colored beers and white wine have fewer congeners than darker beers and harder liquors. Stay away from brandy, whisky, and red wine.Cheap boozes tend to give you a worse hangover. Your body expends more energy to process impurities left in the alcohol.
Clearer alcohols like vodka, gin, and white rum are good options.

 Another way of writing a will at no charge is to use an online wills template. Unlike books and software, which you need to purchase, a number of online wills templates (though not all) are free of charge. These templates are like software, except software normally needs to be installed on your computer using a CD or DVD. However, in the case of templates, you can simply access the template online as you would any other website. These will templates generally allow you to download your will or save your answers online.To find a free online will template, type “free online will template” or related terms in a search engine.
 The first step in using an online wills program is to build your document online by filling in the blanks in the template, such as those available at RocketLawyer.Be sure to choose the correct state (i.e., the state where you live) before beginning the form, as the law of wills is governed by state law and you should not use the form of another state.
 Once you are finished filling out the template, be sure to save the document (if the program allows), download the document (if the program allows) so that you have an electronic version of your will for future reference, and print the document., For a will to be legally enforceable, it must be signed in the presence of witnesses. Check your state laws regarding the number of witnesses required and whether there are any specific instructions that need to be provided to the witnesses before signing. Some states may require more witnesses than others,and California, for example, requires that the witnesses be read out a number of instructions before signing.

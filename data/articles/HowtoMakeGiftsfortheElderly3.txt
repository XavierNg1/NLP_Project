 Gather assorted cards, paper, envelopes, stamps and pens. Place them in a decorative box so that the person can access them easily the next time they want to write to friends or family.
 Keep in mind the person's favorite colors and their decorating preferences. Flowers can brighten up a home for weeks or years.
 Include their favorite candy and tea. Add reading material, like a magazine or a book.


Other ideas for a gift basket include large print word search, cross word or sudoku puzzle books, gift certificates, homemade fleece blankets and lotions.






Weave ribbon in and out of the basket to decorate it. You can also wrap your gifts in a homemade fleece blanket, so they won't have to dispose of a basket.
 If you have a family who will be giving the gift with you, include a gift certificate/coupon for each member of the family. You can also include coupons for outings.


Personal coupon ideas include housework, gardening, grooming, movies, a walk, reading a book aloud, writing down memories or anything you have been meaning to do with them but have not yet scheduled. Kids can give gift certificates for hugs or homemade paintings.

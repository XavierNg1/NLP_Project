 All friendships are not meant to last forever. You may do everything you can to stay friends, but it just does not work out. Always give your best effort before you decide to stop being friends with someone. You may need to end the friendship if:You and your friend are constantly arguing and can never seem to get along.
Your friendship makes you feel bad about yourself or hurts your self-esteem.
If you always feel uncomfortable or nervous around your friend.
 If you feel like you no longer want to be friends, have a trial separation so you can be sure.This will give you time to see what it would be like to not have this person in your life. Having time away will also give you a clearer head and a different perspective on your friendship.


When you decide to take a break, be clear about the purpose and the length of the break. You may say, "Hey, we have not been getting along lately. I think we should spend some time apart. We can talk about things in 2 weeks."
Use this time to think and journal about your friendship. Do you miss the person? Are you happier now that you are not spending time with them? What things need to change?

, You may be ready to make a decision once your friendship break is over. If you decide to end the friendship, let the person know. Do not cut them out of your life without telling them. If you were truly friends, you owe them an explanation.Be honest and respectful of the other person's feeling when you talk to them.
You may say, "I care about you a lot, but our friendship has changed. I am really sad about this, but I don't think we should be friends anymore."

 Balloons are a common party decoration. However, your confetti filled balloons will be all the more alluring because of the interesting designs and colorful decorative bits inside. To display the balloons, you might:

Hang balloons from various fixtures and furniture, like sills, floor lamps, chairs, and so on.
Allow helium balloons to float up to picturesque parts of the ceiling. For example, you might float clusters of balloons into the corners of your party room.
Tie helium filled balloon strings to some kind of weight, like a doorstop, a rock, and so on. Place the balloons around your party area as decorations.
 If you're decorating for a more formal party, you may have centerpieces on tables. These are often heavy enough to attach some balloons to, no problem. You can also tape balloons along the edges of tables or to the table corners to add a dash of style.

Oftentimes, helium filled balloons can be tied to the underside of the table and, if the string is long enough, floated out into the open so that balloons aerially border the table.
 Keep away is a popular game played with balloons. A fun version of this game involves players taking turns hitting a balloon up into the air, with each player trying to keep the balloon from hitting the ground. These games work best when played with air filled balloons.The confetti inside the balloons should jostle around every time the balloon is touched by a player. This can make the game more challenging and visually appealing.
You may also be able to use helium balloons that have started to lose their buoyancy to play these games.

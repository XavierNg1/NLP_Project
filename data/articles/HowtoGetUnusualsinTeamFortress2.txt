 Launch Team Fortress 2, if you’re playing on a PC, or load the game on your console. Once the game finishes loading and you’ve reached the main menu, open “Shop” from the list of menu options. This will open the Mann Co. Store.


Mann Co. Store is an in-game store where players can buy and trade game items using real money.;
, On the Mann Co. Store home tab, select the Mann Co. Supply Crate Key (gold key). These keys open specific types of crates that contain items with Unusual quality.


You can buy the Mann Co. Supply Crate Key for $1.99.
 After you’ve purchased the keys, go back to the main menu and start any type of Multiplayer mode. Play through the game until you acquire an item called Mann Co. Supply Crate.


These items are shown as plain wooden crates with chains and a lock wrapped around it.
Mann Co. Supply Crates are acquired at random, so you have to be a little patient.
 Once you’ve found a Mann Co. Supply Crate, open your Bag by pressing the button stated on the screen on your controller/keyboard. On the Bag menu, select the Mann Co. Supply Crate Key to use it.
 Choose the Mann Co. Supply Crate from the list of items you can use the key on. Once you’ve opened the crate, you’ll be able to get a free item with random quality.


The chances of obtaining items with Unusual quality are rather low, but you can only get it from the Mann Co. Supply Crate.

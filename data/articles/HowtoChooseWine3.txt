 One of the most popular grapes around, the citrus-flavored, crisp, and green apple laced Chardonnay is a well-balanced and versatile grape. It can be crafted into many different wines, from sharp and bright to buttery and woody, and anywhere in between.


If you're on a budget, a Chardonnay is often your best bet.Chardonnay is either "oaked" or not. Oaked chardonnay has the toasty, vanilla-like flavors, whereas unoaked is usually crisper and brighter., It goes well with fish, chicken, and even some heavier meals (especially the California Pinot Grigio). It is light and fruity, often carrying heavy notes of pear flavors along with citrus. Light on alcohol and oak, it is easily drinkable even without food.
 One of the most common white grapes out there, the Sauvignon Blanc hosts notes of citrus and berry, even peaches, that make it a good pairing for lighter, softer dishes or casual drinking with appetizers. It can be made in a variety of styles depending on aging and fermenting, so be sure to check out the bottle of each one -- they won't be all the same!


Sauv Blancs are also your best cooking white wine, as they have a punch of acidity without too much overpowering flavor.
 The Riesling, a wine of German origin, ranges from sharp and dry to strongly sweet, making it a versatile, though very particular, wine to choose. The drier versions will cut hard into shellfish and spicy dishes -- think Asian cuisine. Meanwhile, the longer aged varieties are perfect on their own as dessert wines, or matched with sharp cheeses.
 The simple, high-acid Rose will add a nice finish to just about any meal, and getting one with bubbles will further help cleanse the palate, no matter what you're chomping on. While Rose often gets a bad rap, it is completely unfounded. Eminently drinkable with or without food, this is a great wine to grab for a large group or if you're unsure about the meal pairing.

 Pour the water a cup, then add the cornstarch. Stir the two together until the cornstarch dissolves, then set the cup aside.If you can't find cornstarch where you live, use cornflour instead (not cornmeal).
 Pour the water into a saucepan, then set the saucepan on the stove. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high to high heat., Keep stirring while you pour the cornstarch water into the boiling water. Do not remove the saucepan from the burner yet., You don't need to do this, but it will give your starch a nice fragrance.Choose something that smells refreshing, such as lavender or lemon.
 Keep stirring the mixture as it cooks.Boiling the cornstarch will help keep it suspended in the water and reducing settling/clogging., Once the cooking time is up, take the saucepan off the burner. Let the mixture cool down to room temperature before pouring it into a spray bottle.If you added any essential oils, you must use a glass spray bottle, as the oils will degrade a plastic one.
 Lightly spray the fabric after washing it, then let it air dry. You can also spray the fabric just before ironing it for a crisp finish. You want the fabric to be wet, but not dripping or soaking.If you need to starch a lot of fabric, pour the starch into a bucket, tub, or sink. Dunk the fabric into it, wring it out, then iron it. You may need to double or triple the recipe.

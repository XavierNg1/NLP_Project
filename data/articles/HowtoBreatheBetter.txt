  While this may seem obvious, most people do not do it all that often.  Breathing through your nose has many advantages to it, the most important one being the filtering ability of your nose.  When you breathe through your mouth, you will automatically inhale cold, unfiltered air that is full of different viruses and bacteria, but most of these get filtered when you breath through the nose.;
,  The air is not automatically sucked into your stomach, it actually requires lots of muscles to do so, such as the diaphragm, abdomen, chest, neck and shoulders.  70-80% of your breathing should be done by the diaphragm.  This has many advantages, with some of them being.


The pressure in your chest is decreased, preventing the heart from working as hard
It is much more efficient than breathing with youre other muscles, because the more effective muscles come into use

,  Everything in our body has a naturel rhythm, and breathing is no different. The hormones in our body follow a natural rhythm, and when you breathe rhythmically, you will find your breathing being in tune with your bod, providing a better and more efficient breathing.
  When you are standing/ sitting with a straight back, your diaphragm will have more space to breath, eventually leading to a more efficient breathing (refer to step 2).  An upright position also helps you to breathe through your nose more easily.
  Slow breathing will lead to a lower heart rate and blood pressure, and also feeling more relaxed and entering a "Rest-and-Digest" position.  Breathing at a pace of 10 or less breathes per minute will result in a better and more relaxed breathing.

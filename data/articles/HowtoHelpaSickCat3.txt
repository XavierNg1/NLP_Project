 Vomiting can accompany many common cat illnesses, as well as occasional digestive problems. If your cat has vomited, offer it plenty of fresh, clean water.If your cat vomits frequently, especially within a brief period, contact a vet.
 For cats with an occasional vomiting problem, keeping them away from food for 24-48 hours can give their digestive system time to recover. If your cat vomits even after having water, you can also withhold it for up to 24 hours. However, do not withhold water from a cat with known or suspected kidney disease., After the vomiting has stopped for a time, you can begin feeding your cat again. Try offering small amounts, 3-6 times a day. The food should be bland so as to not upset the cat’s digestive system again. Good suggestions for a bland diet include boiled, skinless chicken or white fish, such as cod.Over the course of a few days, gradually increase the amount you feed the cat.
After a few days on a bland diet, begin mixing a small portion of your cat’s regular food with the bland foods. Start with something like 1 part regular food to 3 parts bland food.
If your cat seems to handle the mixed food without a problem, wait a day or two and mix one-half regular food and one-half bland food. After a day or so of that, try 3 parts regular food to one part bland food. If that also works, then you can go back to feeding your cat only its regular food.

 Start by rinsing the brush under running water. Make sure the tip is down towards the sink, so the makeup runs out. Also, try to mostly just get the bristles under the water, as the water can weaken the glue and the finish on the brush., To clean the brush, use a bit of baby shampoo. You can use other shampoos, but baby shampoo is gentler. Rub it into the brush, using your fingers or by swirling the brush around your palm. Rinse the shampoo out, working until the water runs clear., Add one part water and two parts vinegar (white or apple cider vinegar) to a bowl or jar, giving it a swish to mix it up. Swirl the brushes in the solution for a minute or so, trying to mostly get the bristles. Once you're done, run them under water again to get the vinegar out., Pat the brushes gently on a paper towel to get most of the excess water out. Use your fingers to shape the bristles into the correct shape if they're bent. Lay the brushes on a paper towel to dry overnight.

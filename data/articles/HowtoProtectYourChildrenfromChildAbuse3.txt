 It's important to communicate and understand how they feel and what they want. Put away distractions and ask open-ended questions, such as "What happened at school today?" and "Why are you feeling frustrated?" Give them your full attention and take time to really understand what they're saying.


Open-ended questions usually start with what, where, when, why, or how.
Hold off with the judgment and advice. Instead of jumping in with advice, let your child feel understood and validated. Then ask "Would you like advice?" (They will probably say yes.)
If your child feels safe coming to you with smaller problems, they will probably feel safe coming to you with bigger ones.
 This can help them feel that their opinion is valued, and that they can speak up. Find little choices that your child can make to give them some control over what happens in their lives.


Have them pick out their own outfits, or choose between a few.
When you are in the fruits and vegetables section of the grocery store, ask them what they would like to eat.
Let them make choices about meals. "Would you like me to make broccoli or carrots with the chicken tonight?"

, Sometimes, you have to override a "no:" no, they can't eat dessert first, no, they may not stay up late, no, they may not skip taking a bath. When this happens, explain why the given thing is important. Validate their feelings and acknowledge that they are upset, without caving on your decision.


For example, "You need to sit in a carseat in order to stay safe. I know that you don't enjoy it. If we get into an accident, your carseat will protect you more than a seatbelt could. If your carseat is uncomfortable, you can tell me about it and we can find a way to fix it together."
This does not mean surrendering power to your child: your word is law in these cases, and you are explaining why the laws matter.

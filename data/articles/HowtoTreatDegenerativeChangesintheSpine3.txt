Breathe evenly while maintaining the contraction of the abdomen and hold it for ten seconds.
This should be done in 3 sets of 10 repetitions each and can be done once daily.
 This exercise can improve the flexibility of the lower hips and spine and improve mobility. Increased mobility relieves stress on the back and can reduce pain and tension in the spine.

Use the strap for support and to elevate the leg until a stretch is felt at the back of the thigh and knee.

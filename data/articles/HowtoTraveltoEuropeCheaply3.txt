 Overnight flights tend to be cheaper, plus you won't have to pay for accommodations that night. Also try to book from a deal website, such as Expedia or Travelocity, but clear your computer's cookies before doing so for even better prices.
 Flying is not the only way to get to Europe. Depending on the time of year and your availability, it may be cost-effective to take a ship at least one way. If you don't live overseas, see if you can get to Europe by train or bus.
 Once you arrive in Europe, avoid renting a car if you're traveling solo or taking taxis. Trains and buses are available to get from city to city. You can buy a Eurail pass ahead of time to save money.
 Walking is the cheapest method of transportation within a city, so make sure to bring a good pair of walking shoes. (This is another reason why it pays to travel light!) City buses are another inexpensive option.

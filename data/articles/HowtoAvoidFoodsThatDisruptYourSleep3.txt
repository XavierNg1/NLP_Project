 Cherries contain melatonin, which is a natural sleep-inducing hormone. Try having a glass of cherry juice before bedtime. You can juice your own or go for a store-bought option that doesn't contain any added sugar., A glass of warm milk to promote a good night’s sleep isn’t just a myth. Milk contains tryptophan, magnesium, and calcium, which all encourage relaxation. A warm beverage can also offer a soothing effect, but keep in mind you won’t want to drink too many fluids before bed or you might need a late night bathroom break.A hot herbal tea is a good option, especially if you have trouble digesting milk. Just make sure the box is marked caffeine-free. Try herbal teas like chamomile or peppermint to promote a good night's sleep., Fortified cereals like shredded wheat contain complex carbs that your body digests easily and slowly. That way you’ll fill your belly until breakfast without giving yourself an immediate energy surge. Other examples of complex carbs include quinoa, barley, and buckwheat.Make sure any cereal you eat before going to sleep is low in sugar.
You can also try snacking on a few whole wheat crackers.Whole grain pastas are sources of complex carbs, but skip the acidic tomato sauce. If you choose pasta as a nighttime snack, try making it with sleep-promoting herbs like sage and basil., Similar to complex carbs, rice is relatively easy to digest. However, it’s high on the glycemic index, so your body breaks it down slowly. That means you don’t get a spike in your blood sugar, which could interrupt your sleep.

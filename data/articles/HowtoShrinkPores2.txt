 Using the cleansing method outlined above, remove your makeup, splash your face with warm water, and pat it dry with a towel.
 Apply the mask to a small patch on your face. Let it sit for a few minutes and then remove it. If the area looks red or inflamed, don't use the mask. If not, go ahead with the next step.
 Masks pull dirt from your pores and reduce inflammation of the surrounding skin, helping to make the pores appear smaller.


Clay masks are ideal for this purpose, but any natural facial mask will work fine. Try making your own mask with yogurt.
Smooth the mask over your face, concentrating in the areas where your pores appear large.
Allow the mask to stay on your face for about fifteen minutes, or the length of time specified on the package.
 Use warm water to gently rinse the mask away. Pat your face dry with a soft towel. Your face should appear fresh, with smaller-looking pores.

 Hold the magnifying glass as still as possible, ensuring the focus of the sun is pointed directly at the match-head, and you’ll be able to take advantage of a process called solar thermal conversion.Try to ensure the dot of the magnification is as small as possible, to minimize the amount of time needed to dry out the match.
The smaller the dot of light, the more intense the heat is, and the quicker this will work.
Do not move the dot of light around. Keep it in the exact same location.
 Your glasses can concentrate the sun’s rays perfectly. Hold your glasses very still and create a small focal point focused on the head of the match. After a bit of time the match head will dry and ignite.


Because of the angle of glasses, there may be a need to rotate the glasses a bit to get the right angle.
Be sure to use just a single lens. Do not try to use both lenses to focus the sun's heat.
 Fill a clear, smooth plastic bag with water and form a sphere. With this balloon, you can focus the power of the sun onto a direct spot just like a magnifying glass.


Rotate the globe to find the right spot that maximizes the heat.If there are wrinkles in the bag, it may not work as well.
Plastic bags that are not clear will not magnify the heat as intensely or as specifically in one area.

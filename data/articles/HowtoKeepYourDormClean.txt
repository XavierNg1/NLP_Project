 When unpacking and putting things away, make it so everything has a designated spot. This will help to keep organized if everything belongs somewhere.;
, Invest in a compact, pop-up laundry hamper with handles. This will really help you to keep your clothes neat and clean ones separated from dirty. It also makes hauling laundry through the building to the laundry room much easier. Remember to bring along laundry detergent, fabric softener, dryer sheets, stain stick, and anything else you use to do your laundry.
 You won't be able to throw your clothes in the washer and walk away while they get clean. Pick a good two-hour block sometime when you have no other obligations. This is an excellent time to get homework completed, or arrange to do your laundry at the same time as a friend so you have someone to talk to. You can also wash your clothes in the sink and hang them up to dry to cut down on your trips to the laundry room.
 It doesn't have to be perfect, but it will go a long way towards making your dorm look cleaner and gives you a nice morning routine. As long as the sheets and the blankets cover up a major portion of the bed, you'll be fine.
 If you don't have a fridge, make sure you are only keeping nonperishable food in your room, and if anything starts to smell, change color, etc. throw it out. Also, don't leave out open cans of soda, donuts, candy, etc. as they can attract bugs and bacteria.
 Even if it is just for five minutes. You want to clean a little at a time so your dorm doesn't turn into a mess you can't handle.
 Take out your trash daily.

 People with dementia often don't remember what happened to them just a few minutes ago. Their short-term memory loss means they do not remember having asked the question in the first place.

Try changing the subject to make them stop asking the question. For example, you might say something like, "Do you remember how we went to the choir concert? Did you like the concert?"You will often find that their long-term memories are still quite good, so changing the subject to a well-remembered past event may work to end the line of questioning. You might ask, for example, “Where were you the day Kennedy was shot?”

, Your loved one may believe people are “out to get” him/her, believe someone is stealing from them, or other beliefs that create suspicion. This is common with Alzheimer’s and dementia.Believing they have been robbed is a common delusion. Provide reassurance that they and their possessions are safe, perhaps taking a few minutes to help locate the “stolen” object.
Consider having your loved one seen by a primary care physician or a psychiatrist to find a medication that will alleviate anxiety.
 If your loved one has been placed in an assisted living facility or nursing home, you may receive calls at all hours of the day and night, possibly one after the other. This can be extremely draining and require some management.


Don't pick up the phone every single time. Consider putting your phone on silent at night.
Listen to your loved one’s concerns and give assurance that you will help take care of the problem.
If it is not an emergency, you do not need to drop everything to attend to the person all the time. Speak to the nurse at the nursing home if you are concerned there is a real problem that needs to be addressed.

 The stylized or design format allows you to register a trademark for words with a particular appearance.


A trademark registered this way is essentially like a logo for the band. It is a visual as well as verbal sign for your group.
If you are filing a stylized/design format application, you should have your mark in jpg format, ready to submit during the application process.
 Read the instructions for filing a new Trademark application using the Trademark Electronic Application System (“TEAS”). Make sure you have your image in the format and color scheme required.


Details for new applications are provided by the USPTO on the TEAS Tutorial webpage.#File your Trademark application. Provide your image and fill out the necessary forms.

 Treat them with love, respect, and selflessness and they will be devoted to you. Scorpios are good friends. Give them 100 percent and they will return it with interest! Scorpios tend to have only a few very intense friendships because they need for their friends to bond with them on the deepest and most intimate level. Flimsy and ephemeral friendships are of no interest to a Scorpio. Once you've been part of their lives they will never forget you.;
, If you wrong a Scorpio, they may eventually forgive you, after making you suffer, but they will never forget. Betrayal will be answered with an unrivaled thirst for vengeance. There's a reason the symbol for this sign is the scorpion. The likelihood youâ€™ll win in a fight with them is very low.
 Most Scorpios (not all) love to compete - and most of all, win. Scorpios love sports or games where they have an opponent to defeat. If Scorpios have a goal, they will always try to reach it.They never give up and usually succeed in whatever they do.

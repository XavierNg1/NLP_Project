 If your character is bubbly, then act bubbly at the audition. If your character is silly, act silly at the audition. Make sure you know what the play is about,because if you do a cold reading, you want to know what the scene is about.;
, Do it in front of your friends and family and ask them honestly what they think. Practice what you will be singing, acting, or dancing. If you are at a musical audition, you will probably have to sing a song. Try to have one prepared from a different musical or play. Perhaps one that is in your key range.
 Wear comfortable clothes and sneakers because most likely, you will have to dance, stretch and simply feel OK in what you're wearing.
, Most people auditioning will be just as nervous as you are.
 (This is good for acting practice as well). Do it in front of the mirror. Walk with good posture - shoulders back head a bit high - and give a big smile to the judges.
 Tell them your name and a bit about you. Try being friendly and tell them what plays or drama you've got involved in before.
 It will be very nerve racking, but just relax. Tell yourself that the worst thing that can happen is you'll get rejected and then you'll probably never see them again, and even though that's worst, it's not even terrible.
 That is what the judges are looking for, after all.
 Odds are you will want to clear your throat before you sing. When anyone asks you a question, speak loudly and clearly. While singing, open your mouth wide and try to smile as you sing.

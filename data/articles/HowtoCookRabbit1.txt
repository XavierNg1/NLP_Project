 Combine the olive oil, Dijon mustard, and a dash of black pepper in a bowl, whisking the ingredients together thoroughly.

You can mix the marinade in a large resealable plastic bag or inside a dish that is large enough to fit all the rabbit pieces in a single layer.;
, Place the rabbit pieces into the marinade and toss well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 1 hour, if not longer.

When roasting an entire rabbit, only use farmed rabbit. If using wild rabbit, only use the saddle or torso of the rabbit. Farmed rabbit has much more fat, so it fares better in dry heat methods like roasting than wild rabbit does.
Since the saddle of wild rabbit is fatty enough, though, it can still be roasted. Use 2 large saddles or 4 smaller saddles from wild rabbits in place of 2 full farmed rabbits.
Marinating the rabbit for 2 hours is actually ideal since the marinade will have more time to permeate and flavor the meat.
 Prepare an ovenproof frying pan by adding the butter to it and warming it over medium-high heat.

Continue heating the butter until it melts.
Duck fat or lard can also be used instead of unsalted butter.
 Add the rabbit to the butter in the frying pan and cook it for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, or until browned on each side., Transfer the ovenproof frying pan with the rabbit and remaining butter into the preheated oven. Cook for about 6 to 8 minutes before testing the pieces for doneness.

When done, the meat should feel firm and there should no longer be any internal redness or blood.
Drain the pan drippings before returning the pan to the stove.
 Pour the stock into the frying pan and heat it over medium until the stock begins to simmer.

The simmer should be fairly gentle. Do not let the stock reach a rapid, rolling boil.
 Remove the frying pan from the heat and let it rest in a warm area for 10 minutes. Serve while still warm.

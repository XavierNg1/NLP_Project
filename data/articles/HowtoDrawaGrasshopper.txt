 These will serve as the guidelines for your drawing. You should end up with two overlapping circles to the right of a peapod-like shape, which will serve as the grasshopper's lower body.;
, The back legs are so defined at the top because of all the jumping around that grasshoppers do, and they're quite a bit longer in total length than the front legs.
 Then add more details to your drawing, like the pattern on the grasshopper's stomach and its eyes.
 You can color your grasshopper if you want, or add highlights/shadows, but they're not really necessary unless your drawing is for a science project or something significant.

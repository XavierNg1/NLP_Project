 Don’t surf the Web, either. Windows XP doesn’t bother truly deleting a file until it needs the disk space, but you have no way of knowing when it will decide to use the disk space your desired file is on. , Examples include WinUndelete and Recuva. Recuva offers basic file recovery for free, while WinUndelete requires purchase for full file recovery. Recuva also offers a paid version with more features. , Both Recuva and WinUndelete offer versions that can be used directly from USB drives without installation onto your computer.


For simpler file recovery in the future, consider installing one of these programs onto your hard drive before you accidentally delete a file.
 Recuva primarily searches by file type and location. WinUndelete offers searches by name, date, size, and type.
 You will need to select the location you want the file to go to. Recovering to a different drive, such as a flash drive, can help you avoid overwriting the very files you are trying to recover.

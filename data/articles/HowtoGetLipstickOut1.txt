 Again, make sure that the fabric doesn’t have any special care instructions. If it does, do not spray hairspray purposely over the lipstick or the stain could get worse., Use any formula hairspray and spray it directly onto the lipstick stain. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes.
 Dampen your cloth with water, and begin to dab away the lipstick. This cloth will absorb the dye, so use one that you don’t mind ruining.
 Depending on the deepness of color in the lipstick stain, this method may not pull all of the lipstick off. If this is the case, follow up with using dish soap. This combination will be mild enough on your clothing to keep it from getting damaged. Once the stain is completely removed, it will be safe to dry the fabric.

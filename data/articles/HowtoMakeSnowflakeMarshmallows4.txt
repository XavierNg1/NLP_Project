 Dust the bottom of an 8x8 inch (20 x 20 cm) baking pan with cornstarch or Mochiko. Pour the wet marshmallow into the pan. Spray a spatula with cooking oil to prevent the marshmallow from sticking to the pan. Then use the spatula to spread the marshmallow out and smooth the surface., Dust the top with a light coating of cornstarch or Mochiko. Then give it about an hour to sit and set. Use your finger to test its resistance by pressing the top lightly. The surface should give without breaking., Use a cookie cutter shaped like a snowflake, or use a knife to cut out your own designs. Either way, make sure to keep your snowflakes small enough to fit into, say, your mug if youâ€™re making these to top hot chocolate or some other snack.

Spray either your cookie cutter or knife with cooking oil for nice, neat cuts without the marshmallow sticking to it. Repeat as needed as you proceed to cut out your snowflakes., Use more cornstarch or Mochiko to dust the sides of each cutout. Transfer your snowflakes to a sieve and shake off the excess. Then dig in or transfer them to an airtight container and store in the fridge up to one week.

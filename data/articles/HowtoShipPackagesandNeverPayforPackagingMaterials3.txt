 Again, keep anything you bring home that can be repurposed as packaging. Remember that paper based items are made of wood and weigh more than packing peanuts, bubble wrap or Styrofoam. Free packaging possibilities include:


Newspaper (great for stuffing and wrapping) - either reuse your read papers or pick up free newspaper from junk mail, free distribution, etc.
Styrofoam (great for protecting fragile objects) - collect from furniture and appliance stores, from purchases of appliances, from Freecycle requests, etc.
Old clothes cut into rags.
Bubble wrap collected from things sent to you (start keeping it, if you buy things by mail, you will start amassing it).
Scrap paper - check the recycling bin in your own home, use up old printer paper, wrapping paper, etc.
Cereal boxes - these are great for protecting wrapping. Simply break down after the cereal is finish and keep flat in piles awaiting reuse.
Envelopes - repurpose junk mail envelopes.
 This is a bit harder but if you wrap inside the post office, some will provide you with the tape. However, this is likely to be fairly inconvenient and other shoppers might find it so too. You will find very cheap tape options at dollar stores or through bulk online purchases.


Use the main shipping centers, not small post offices when using their tape.
Ask friends and family to donate unwanted tape to you. This can be helpful if they're hoarders!

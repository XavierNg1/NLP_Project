 You'll want to test the pH and the Alkalinity Levels, as well as the Calcium Hardness levels. There are kits that allow you to do this at home, but you can also take a sample to your local pool and spa store and they should be able to test it for you.;
, 80-120 PPM is ideal. This helps to keep your pH levels steady. I recommend Alkalinity Increaser by Bio-Guard. The bottles will tell you how much to add, or if you tested in store, they will tell you exactly what you need.
 Add chemicals to adjust this as needed. I recommend PH Increaser and PH Decreaser by Bio-guard. On most hot tubs, you'll only need a couple tablespoons of either to get you to the right spot.
 If it is too high, you will get calcium deposits in your lines and equipment. If it is too low, like with soft water, it will corrode your equipment. An ideal level is between 150-250. If you water is too hard, you'll want to use Stain & Scale products to protect your equipment. If it's too soft, you can use Calcium Hardness Increaser by Bio-Guard.
 If you are using tablets, I recommend putting in 2-3 and giving your tub a boost with 2 tbs of Bromine powdered concentrate. This will put a good reserve into your water.
 This will clear the water of any additional contaminants.
, Add 2-3 tbs of shock with the jets running and wait 15 minutes. THEN test the water for bromine, pH, and alkalinity levels with your test kit or test strips. In general, you want your bromine level at 3-5 parts per million. Right after you shock it, you may see a higher number. Don't worry about that! Keep your alkalinity within range and your PH will stay pretty steady as well.

 You will need to collect at least 70 gold Bricks before Aquaman's door appears. You will receive 60 Gold Bricks for completing every objective in Story Mode (beat a Chapter, rescuing a citizen, collecting minikits). You can also find Gold Bricks hidden around the city. There are 250 Gold Bricks total., You will need 125,000 Studs to purchase Aquaman after building his door. You will collect Studs as you explore the game and beat levels., Once you have enough Gold Bricks, you will be able to find the deconstructed door that unlocks Aquaman. This door can be found in the northwest area of the city, to the east of Gotham Beach near Ace Chemicals. The door is located on a rooftop, so you will need a flying character in order to reach it.


The building has a large fan on the top, along with a water tower. The door is located on the lower part of the roof on the north side of the building. There will be a checkered ramp nearby.
The door may not appear right away. Wait a few moments for it to show up.
 Use the Assemble button to build the door from the pieces lying on the ground. As soon as the door is complete, Aquaman will walk out.
 Walk up to Aquaman and press A (Xbox 360) or X (PS3) to purchase Aquaman. This requires 125,000 Studs. Once you purchase Aquaman, he is selectable in Free Play from your roster.
 Aquaman is a powerful character. Besides his pointy trident, Aquaman can spray water and is one of the only characters that can dive. You can find a lot of valuable Studs and Gold Bricks by diving in the right areas. Aquaman also has Super Strength, allowing him to interact with objects that require the Super Strength skill.

 If diet and exercise alone do not lower your cholesterol levels, you may need to take medication. If you are concerned about your weight, your cholesterol levels, or your overall lifestyle, talk to your doctor about developing a plan and taking cholesterol medication., Statins are a class of drugs that slow down or stop one of your body's enzymes responsible for producing cholesterol. Statins are one of the most successful medications for lowering cholesterol levels. Some studies suggest statins can reduce LDL cholesterol by 20 to 55 percent.Common statins include atorvastatin (Lipitor), rosuvastatin (Crestor) and simvastatin (Zocor).Some people experience muscle pain, joint pain, and changes in liver enzyme levels. Do not take statins if you have liver disease or are pregnant., Ezetimibe helps lower the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the body. It can be taken in conjunction with statins, but even on its own Ezetimibe has been shown to reduce LDL levels by 18 to 25 percent.Ezetimibe may cause joint pain, diarrhea, and sleepiness. Do not drive or operate machinery until you know how Ezetimibe will affect you., Bile acid resins are a class of drugs that bind to cholesterol-rich bile acids in the intestines, then eliminate them through bodily wastes. This class of medications has been shown to reduce LDL levels by 15 to 30 percent.Common bile acid resins include cholestyramine (Prevalite), colestipol (Colestid) and colesevelam (Welchol).This class of medication may need to be taken with other cholesterol medications to effectively reduce cholesterol levels.Possible side effects include stomach pain and constipation.

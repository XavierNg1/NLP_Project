 There are two main types of doorknobs with hidden levers. These hidden levers can be in the form of a thin slot or a pinhole. Determine which kind of knob you have, because each knob will detach from the door differently.These hidden levers are also called detents.;
, You'll have to apply pressure to the detent at the base of your doorknob. If your doorknob has a thin slot at the base of it, you need to use a flathead screwdriver to press down on the hidden latch inside of it. If there is a pin hole at the base of your knob, you'll need to use a thin object like a pin or paper clip to disengage it. , With the hidden lever still pushed, pull on the doorknob. It should come loose. If you're having problems removing the knob from the latch, you may have to twist it or wiggle it back and forth. You should be able to remove both knobs from each side of the door.

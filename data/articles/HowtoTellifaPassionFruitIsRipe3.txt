 If you have fruit that is almost but not quite there yet, give it a few days to ripen further. Leave it sitting out at room temperature, away from direct sunlight.Inspect it daily so you can enjoy before it becomes too wrinkly, at which point it starts to dry out inside., Do not eat the skin. Use a knife to cut open it. To eat it as is, slice off the top and use a spoon as though you were eating from a bowl.To add it as an ingredient to another dish, slice it in half so you can spoon it out more easily., Once you have cut it open, refrigerate or freeze your fruit to keep it from spoiling. Expect refrigerated fruit to last a week at most. For longer storage, seal it in a high-quality freezer bag and freeze it, which will preserve it up to twelve months.

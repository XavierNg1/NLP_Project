 If you only have a few small files to transfer, using email will be the simplest option. Many email providers limit file sizes to 25MB or less.
 Compose a new email, with yourself as the recipient. Add files by attaching them to the email. When you are finished attaching files, send the email.


Depending on how your email service operates, and how large the files are, it may take a few minutes for your email to arrive.
 Open the email that you sent to yourself. Download the attached files to your Mac.

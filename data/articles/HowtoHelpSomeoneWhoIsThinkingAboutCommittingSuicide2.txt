 Do not leave the person alone if you believe they are in crisis. Seek immediate help by calling 9-1-1, a crisis intervention specialist, or a trusted friend.
 If someone is in a suicidal crisis, practice means restriction, which involves reducing their ability to harm themselves.It is particularly important to remove any items that were specifically part of a visualized suicide plan.


Most men who commit suicide choose guns to harm themselves, while women are more likely to poison themselves with drugs or toxic chemicals.Remove the person’s access to firearms, medications, toxic chemicals, belts, ropes, very sharp knives or scissors, cutting tools like saws, and/or any other items that may facilitate a suicide. Your goal in removing the means of suicide is to slow down the suicide process so that the person has time to calm themselves down and choose to live.
 The person in crisis will likely ask you to keep their feelings of suicide a secret. However, you should not feel obligated to keep this request; this is a life-threatening event, so calling a crisis management specialist to help is not a violation of the person’s trust. You may want to call on one or more of the following resources for help:


the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
a school counselor or spiritual leader such as a priest, pastor, or rabbi
the person in crisis’s doctor
9-1-1 (if you feel the person is in immediate danger)

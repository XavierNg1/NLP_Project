 Take the green paint and draw/dribble several faint green spots on the outside of a plastic sandwich bag. Don't make too much of them or else it'll look obvious.;
, Seal the bag tight and make sure that all of the air is out. Double check to make sure that the sandwich doesn't move/slide around. If it does, your "mold" won't look real. Write a note using a sticky Post-It note that says, "Please ask before tossing".
 Place your sandwich bag in the very back of the fridge in a sitting position. You want to give the illusion that the sandwich has been in there for a while.
 Make sure no one is looking while you uncover the delicious and fresh sandwich from the bag.

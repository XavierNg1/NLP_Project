 If you are selecting fruit directly from a tree, donâ€™t pick them. Let gravity do the work. Expect ripe fruit to fall on their own due to their increased weight.However, unripened fruit may also fall due to weather or if the tree is weak from dehydration. Double-check its ripeness by other methods before eating.
 Weigh it in your hand. Recognize immature fruit by its lightness.Favor those that feel heavier than you would expect based on their size.A mature passion fruit should be between four and eight centimeters in diameter and weigh between 1.2 and 1.8 ounces (35 and 50 g)., Give the fruit a very gentle squeeze. The skin should give a little when pressed, but still feel firm.If it feels rock-hard fruit, consider it unripened.If it feels soft, it has passed its peak.

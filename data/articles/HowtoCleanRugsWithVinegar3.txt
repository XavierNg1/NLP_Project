 Combine 1/4 cup (.05 l) vinegar and 1/4 cup (.05 l) water in a clean spray bottle.



Spray the spot-cleaning solution on the stain.
Blot the stain with a clean cloth. Do not rub the stain into the carpet fibers.
Reapply the vinegar solution and blot the stain until it is no longer visible. Some stains may need to be treated more than once.



Mix baking soda and white vinegar together to form a paste.
Work the paste into the stain, using any soft brush or an old toothbrush.
Allow the spot-removing paste to dry and then vacuum the spot.

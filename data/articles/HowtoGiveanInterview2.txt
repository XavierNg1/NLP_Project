 A published interview can be risky, but it can also get your name out there.
 If you would like to sound like an expert, read trade journals, web articles and books the week before the interview. If you are going to quote something it should be correct.
 It’s likely that these written answers won’t reflect how you will deliver them, but it will help you get the facts straight.
 Ask them to pose the questions you came up with. Then, try a few more answers so that you sound natural giving them.
 Understand that any information that they gather from the setting may be used to describe you.
 Instead of pausing, just ask, “Could you go a little more in depth about that?” or “Could you repeat that?”

, If you’ve done research and practiced a little, the information you want to convey is likely to be on the forefront of your mind. Show your personality during an interview, while being professional.
 Ask the interviewer questions as well to make it feel more like an exchange. The person is going to enjoy the interview and have a more favorable impression of your answers., If the interviewer seemed to skip over something that is important, you can say, “I’d like to go back to that” or “I think this is an important part that we should touch on.”

, You probably are, so stop after the next complete thought. You don’t have to answer every question elaborately.
 The interviewer doesn’t always do their research properly, so feel free to provide them with background information that is advantageous to you.
 You may also ask them to send you some copies. Give them your email or phone number for follow-up questions.

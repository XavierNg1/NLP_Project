 Branches that are dead or diseased should be cut away each year so that the tree can stop wasting energy on them. Use a tree saw or loppers to cut the branches flush with the tree trunk. Be sure to make clean cuts so that the tree isn't vulnerable to further disease.









If larger branches have developed a collar, cut just outside the collar, a few inches from the trunk.
Dead and diseased branches can be removed any time of year, since taking them off won't affect the growth of the tree.
 If you notice a branch or two that don't seem to be producing fruit, you may want to remove them. Make your cut flush with the tree's trunk, rather than just cutting back to a bud, since new growth on the same branch isn't likely to produce different results.
 Suckers are new shoots that come up from the root system around the base of the tree. Cut them away so that the tree's energy is directed into the main tree trunk and won't get sapped by the suckers. Cut the suckers all the way to the ground using loppers.
 Each season, the tree is likely to produce new branches that cross over existing branches. It's important to prune the tree carefully so that no crossover branches remain. Crossover branches crowd the tree and prevent sunlight from filtering through the branches. They also inhibit air flow and can leave the tree vulnerable to disease and pests.
 If your plum tree is getting too big for your yard, you can prune in the summer to slow down its growth. Whereas dormant pruning encourages vibrant spring growth, summer pruning cuts away the tree's energy and limits growth for the season.









If you prune in the summer, be careful not to cut away too much of the tree.
Pruning too late in the summer can make the tree vulnerable to cold winter temperatures. In the US, don't prune after July to reduce the risk of frost damage to new growth.
Beware that summer pruning can cause the tree to put its energy into leaf growth rather than fruit production.

 One of the numerous important factors that contribute to heart health is your genetics. In particular, it’s important to know if your family has a history of heart diseases, as this predisposition can inform the decisions you make about you and your family’s health moving forward.Speak with your parents and grandparents about any health conditions they have, including things like high blood pressure.
Similarly, inform your own and your children’s doctor about any heart conditions that run in your family. The more your healthcare providers know about your genetic heritage, the better they can help advise you about your family’s health.
 Your own as well as your children’s cardiovascular health can be strengthened by breastfeeding. Not only do breastfed children grow up with a smaller chance of developing some heart conditions, they are also less likely to develop conditions that lead to other health complications.Feed your baby exclusively with breastmilk for the first six months. Continue to include breastmilk in their diet until they are about a year old.
 Smoking significantly and immediately damages your own cardiovascular system, as well as that of anyone you smoke around. People who are exposed to secondhand smoke are as much as 30% more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke. Even brief exposure can have serious effects upon your own or others' heart health.If you or a guest smokes, have them do so outside and away from open windows or doors.
 Having a drink now and then is okay for most healthy adults, but drinking in excess can lead to serious health problems like high blood pressure, stroke, and obesity. If you do drink, make sure that you limit yourself to no more than one drink a day if you are a woman, or up to two drinks per day if you are a man.

 When searching for a pole to make your spear, you’ll want something at least as tall as you. Ideally it would be a few inches taller in order to give you a better reach.The pole you choose should be anywhere from 1–1.5 inches (2.5–3.8 cm) in diameter.Hardwoods, such as ash or oak, are best for this project. To sharpen your spear, find some sort of rough surface such as stone, or a brick wall/ sidewalk. Rub it against the surface and sharpen it well.If you are making a spear in the wilderness, search surrounding areas for a sapling of the right size. You can choose to use live wood or a recently deceased tree, whatever is available.;
, Using a knife or a small hand-axe, carefully fashion a point on one end of your pole or branch.


Form the point by using small, even strokes and always cut away from yourself to avoid injury.
This can be quite a time consuming task. Even with a sharp knife, cutting away at wood can be dangerous and physically taxing.
 Once you are satisfied with the point of your spear, hold the sharpened end just above the flames, turning until you see the wood change color. Continue turning over the fire until the entire point is completely “baked.”Fire hardening is simply drying the wood out to make it lighter and harder. Moist wood is soft, dry wood is hard. By holding the spear tip over the flames, you are simply removing all moisture from the wood.

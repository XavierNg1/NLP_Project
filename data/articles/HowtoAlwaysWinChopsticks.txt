, In "Splits," Instead of tapping the opponent's hand, you can split your hand, which counts as a move. For instance, let's say one hand has four fingers and the other has two. That equals 6. During your turn, you can "redistribute" those fingers, so that each hand has 3 fingers held out (you wouldn't want to do a 5,1 split because then the hand with 5 would be a dead hand). There are a few ways to govern splits:




The players can split the finger count any way they want. If they have a 4,1 distribution, they can split that to 3,2.
The players can only split a finger count in half. If they have 2,0, they can split it 1,1. If they have 3,1, they can split it 2,2. If they have 3,2, they can't split it because there's no way to split five fingers in half.
A player can be allowed to "revive" a dead hand by splitting.
 For example, when your opponent starts the game and taps your hand, split to three on one hand and zero on the other. At this point your opponent has no choice but to tap your hand again as them splitting to two on one hand would lead to an instant win for you. Once your opponent taps your "three" hand, you have two options to split (2),(2) or (3,1). It is ideal to split (3,1) because the game will be won more rapidly but it is still possible to force a win from (2,2).


From (3,1), assume your opponent taps your (3) hand. You are left with (4,1). It is then ideal to split (3,2).

If your opponent taps your (3) hand you tap one of their hands with your now (4) hand your opponent will tap your (4) hand and you will be left with (2,0). You split (1,1) and (1,1) against just one finger is an easy win. The way to win in that case will be described later on.

If your opponent taps your (2) hand you will be left with (3),(3). Next, tap either hand with a (3). Your opponent will be left with (4,1)

If your opponent splits to (3,2), tap their (2) hand. (If you tap their (3) hand your opponent will split and you will wind up with 3,3 against 1,1 again). From this point your opponent has to split their (3). You will then tap their (2), your opponent will tap one of your hands and then you will win.
If your opponent taps your hand with a 4, you take out their 4 and your opponent has no choice but to tap your remaining hand with a 1 and you win. If your opponent taps your hand with a 1, you will take out their 4 and your opponent will have no choice but to tap out your 4 hand. You will be left with 3,0 against 1. This scenario will be described later on.





If from (3,1) your opponent taps your (1) hand, it is ideal to tap their hand with your (3) hand. Your opponent will be left with (4,1).

If your opponent splits to (3,2) it is ideal tap out their (2) hand. Then your opponent will have no choice but to split to (2,1). Then, tap out their (2) hand. Your opponent has no choice but to tap your (2) hand. Then, it is ideal to split to (4,2). Your opponent will then tap your (4) hand, you split (1,1) and (1,1) against just one finger is an easy win. The way to win in that case will be described later on.

If your opponent taps your (3) you tap their (4) hand, and you are left with (2,0) against (1,0). Your opponent will be forced to tap your (2), and you will be left with 3,0 against 1. This scenario will be described later on.

If your opponent taps your (2) hand, you tap their (4) hand and you are left with (3,0). Your opponent will have to tap you again giving you (4,0) you win by tapping their hand.



If your opponent taps your 2 hand, split to 2,2. Your opponent will then tap you leaving you with 3,2. Tap their hand with your 2. Your opponent will have no choice but to split to 1,2. From there tap out their 2 hand and your opponent will have to tap your two hand. Split to 4,2, your opponent will tap your 4 hand and you will be left with 2,0. From there you split (1,1) and (1,1) against just one finger is an easy win. The way to win in that case will be described later on.

If your opponent taps your 1 hand, split to 3,1. Your opponent will have to tap your 1 hand. From 3,2, tap their hand with your 2. Your opponent will have no choice but to split to 1,2. From there tap out their 2 hand and your opponent will have to tap your two hand. Split to 4,2, your opponent will tap your 4 hand and you will be left with 2,0. From there you split (1,1) and (1,1) against just one finger is an easy win. The way to win in that case will be described later on.
 Your opponent will tap one of your hands leaving you with 2,1. Split to 3,0, your opponent will be forced to tap your 3 leaving you with 4,0. Finally, you tap their hand to win the game.
 This situation, however, can be forced into a win as well. Once your opponent splits 2,0 tap their 2 hand (if you try to split 2,0 as well your opponent will just split back to 1,1 and it will go in a never-ending loop. From 3,0 your opponent has to split to 2,1, you then split to 2,0. Their only option is to hit you with their 2 hand to be 4,0. Now you split to 2,2.


If your opponent taps one of your 2 hands with their 1, tap out their 2. Your opponent will then have no choice but to tap your 2. Then you will be left with 3,3. Split to 2,4, your opponent will tap out your 4, and then you split (1,1) and (1,1) against just one finger is an easy win. The way to win in that case is described in step 5.

If your opponent taps one of your 2 hands with their 2, tap out their 2. Your opponent will then have no choice but to tap out your 4. From there, you split (1,1) and (1,1) against just one finger is an easy win. The way to win in that case is described in step 5.

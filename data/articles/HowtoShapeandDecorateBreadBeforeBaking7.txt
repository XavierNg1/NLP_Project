 Divide the 1kg dough into 10 balls for large rolls, or 13-15 balls for dinner rolls.
 Pick up one end in your thumb and fingers and wrap the other end around your fingers, going away from you. The dough end should now be tucked underneath the loop to form a simple knot. This is similar to tying a knot in a balloon.


You may also roll the dough thinner, and tie a double knot, reef knot or any other form such as a pretzel which is also attractive.
Another variation is to pick up the dough "sausage" in the middle and then twist the two halves around each other like you would make string or twine, then tuck the exposed ends underneath to make a round knot shape.
 You may dip in seeds or grains as per the Baguette method. Place them directly on the baking tray to proof, or on a floured cloth from which you can later transfer to a hot stone. Proof until doubled in size. Also splash the oven with water if you desire a crisp crust.
 The rolls should be golden and hollow when tapped.

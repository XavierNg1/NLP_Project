 Entertainment performances, and particularly dance routines, are a common feature of travel shows. Different dance groups will wear costumes and present dances that represent nations and cultures from around the world. These types of performances are also a nice way to take a break from hustling from booth to booth on the exhibit floor.Look for performance schedules on the travel show’s website or your ticket packet.
 Larger shows often bring in travel industry celebrities as headliners to help draw in visitors. You might find hosts of popular cable or public television travel shows giving lectures or offering travel tips. Cooking demos, often showcasing cuisine from popular destinations, are also a common occurrence.The more well-known the individual — Rick Steves, Andrew Zimmern, or Samantha Brown, to name a few — the more prominently they will be advertised, and the larger the crowd is likely to be.
Even if a lecture or demo isn’t a must-see event for you, it does provide another excuse to take a bit of a breather from the hustle and bustle of the convention.
 Many travel shows are also now advertised as “adventure shows,” for those interested in more action-packed vacations. Don’t be surprised to find a climbing wall in the convention hall, or a zip line carrying squealing visitors overhead.Since you’ll be doing a lot of standing and walking, it’s a good idea to wear comfortable clothes and sensible shoes in any case — but especially if you’re interested in adventure activities.
 Most vacation destinations are advertised as family-friendly, so travel shows in turn usually have activities and content geared toward kids and families. Examine the website for information on kid-centric performances, games, exhibits, and activities. Also, many travel shows let kids in free with a paying adult.

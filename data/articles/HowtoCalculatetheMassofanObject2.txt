 The set equation relating mass, density, and volume is D=m/v or density equals mass divided by volume.
 If the density of your object is 500 kg/m3 (kilograms per cubic meter), then you put 500 in place of the D for 500=m/v. If your volume is 10 m3 (cubic meters), put 10 in place of the v for 500=m/10.
 As you are trying to calculate mass, the variable in this equation is m. You want this value to end up alone on one side of the equal sign. In this equation, it is involved in division with another value. To isolate it, you must multiply both sides of the equation by this value. This equation becomes (500)10=(m/10)10.


Isolating a variable is always done by performing the opposite mathematical function on both sides of an equation. If the variable is involved in addition, subtract the extra value from both sides, etc.
 On the left side of the equation, 500 times 10 simplifies to 5000. On the right side, the two 10's cancel out, leaving the m alone. Thus the answer is 5000kg=m.


Don't forget your units. The cubic meters have canceled each other out to leave only kilograms.

 The first step of the digestive process takes place in the mouth. Your teeth are used to mechanically grind down foods into smaller, more manageable pieces. The smaller pieces provide more surface area for stomach acid to react to., The chemical breakdown of food molecules also starts in the mouth. Your saliva contains enzymes that begin breaking down food molecules while you chew. Once you swallow the food, it encounters more enzymes in the stomach and the duodenum. Some of the most common uses for enzymes are:Breaking proteins into amino acids
Breaking down complex carbohydrates into simpler ones
Breaking fats into simpler fats

, Your digestive system absorbs the nutrients that the rest of your body needs. It passes these nutrients into the bloodstream, where they are carried to all of the cells of the body. Most nutrient absorption takes place in the jejunum, the second section of the small intestine.Additional nutrients are absorbed in the third chamber of the small intestine, the ileum. Even still, a very small amount of nutrients can be absorbed in the colon, also known as the large intestine.
 Once the nutrients have been taken from the food, your body has to prepare the leftover food mass for elimination. The first step is to solidify the the mass. The colon is responsible for absorbing water from the food mass and forming it into solid feces. This also serves to keep your body hydrated., Once solid feces has been formed in the colon, it must exit the body. The waste moves the length of the colon until it reaches the anus. At the anus, your body expels the feces.

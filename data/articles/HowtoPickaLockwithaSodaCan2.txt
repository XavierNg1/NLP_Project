 Wrap it around the vertical end of the loop, on the side where the lock opens. Make sure that the U of your shim is pointing downwards.
 This may take some tries to get a feel for it and adjust the shim to the lock. It's possible that you may rip off or break your shim. If this happens, simply make another one and try again.

 Have all the ingredients ready in advance, so you don't waste time at the grocery store

, Think of things that are easily manageable, and don't require a lot of setup at the picnic grounds. You may all like fondue, but trying to get a fire going at the park may not be such a great idea.

If you're going to a park, you might have a nice soft blanket, but also consider adding a waterproof tarp underneath. The grass may have been watered or damp.
Cushions are nice to relax on if you have them. Some people like low chairs for comfort.
 Flowers, candles, even a pair of battery-powered speakers with nice music on your iPod can all set a wonderfully romantic mood. No boom-boxes, please. The idea is to keep it intimate, not start a block party.

Just in case it rains, have an umbrella.
Just in case the weather gets bad before you get there, have a backup plan.

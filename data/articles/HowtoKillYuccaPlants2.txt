 Remove all branches and vegetation with pruning shears, then cut down the main trunk if you can.
 Stump remover is available at most nursery and hardware stores.
 Angle the holes down at a 45-degree angle.
 The plant absorbs the herbicide through the trunk and circulates it through the plant's root system.
 You might see some sprout up after the main plant is killed. Any roots that are not destroyed by the herbicide will still make new shoots.
 You may need to repeat the herbicide application several times to get rid of them.

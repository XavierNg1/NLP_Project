 Because your feet are at an elevation and there's a balance element involved, wall-plank dive bombers present your body with more of a challenge than the regular dive bomber pushup.Stand with your back to a wall and kick your feet up onto the wall. To start, you probably want to keep your feet pretty low on the wall. The higher your feet are on the wall, the more challenging the exercise.
Complete the dive bomber pushup with your feet on the wall. You won't be lowering your torso and hips all the way to the ground since your feet are on the wall, you'll just be lowering your hips to roughly the same level as your feet.
 A BOSU ball, which is half a stability ball with a flat surface on the other side, is a variation of the dive bomber pushup that adds a balance element.Instead of placing your hands on the floor, place the BOSU ball in front of you, ball-side on the floor, and grasp either side of the flat surface with your hands. Keep your arms straight and maintain balance and even weight distribution.
 When you add a renegade row to the end of each dive bomber push up you do, you build strength in your arms and shoulders while also working on your core and back.Choose dumb bells that are a good weight for you for rowing exercises (you may want to start lighter than you first think), and hold them in your hands from starting position. The dumb bells should be sitting on the floor, so if you have dumb bells that have hexagon-shaped heads you might want to use those so they don't roll around.
Do the dive bomber pushup like normal, but when you push back up to starting position, lift the weight with a rowing motion, first with one arm and then with the other. Stay in dive bomber start position with your stable arm straight, wrist directly below your shoulder.

 No one should ever feel too embarrassed to dance. If you are shy and feel uncomfortable, don't start the dance party. If partygoers are already dancing, join in, even if it is just for one song.


Dance floors are sometimes a good way to meet people. You can always compliment someone on their dance moves.
Let the music take over and don't fight the temptation. You will have an easier time dancing by feeling the rhythm and moving to the beat.
 If there is alcohol at the party, which there probably will be, don’t be shocked. Pour yourself a drink if the host offered it to you. Don’t make it a goal to get drunk, but having a drink or two could help you loosen up and chat with people. If you don’t want to drink, respect other people's decisions for drinking.


If you're underage, be sure to skip the drinking. It's easy for underage drinkers to drink too much, landing you in the hospital or worse. You could also get into serious legal trouble.
It is easy for people to over-drink at house parties due to social anxiety. Be aware of this phenomenon, and drink with caution and at a slow pace.
Drink plenty of water between consuming alcoholic beverages. Alcohol dehydrates the body, so you’ll need to keep your water levels high while drinking alcohol.
Don't drink with the goal of feeling social and outgoing. You could potentially become very intoxicated., Bring a deck of cards with you just in case some people want to play a card game. A popular card game at parties is poker or “Circle of Death.” There are other games you can play at parties like hide n’ seek, four corners, or a board game like Twister. House parties are all about letting loose and having fun.


Don’t feel embarrassed for trying to start a game. There will be at least one or two other people who think you have a good idea.

 If you need to use the sugar right now, you can simply put it through a blender or food processor. This can break up the hardened chunks and produce grainy, usable brown sugar. Simply chop or pulse the sugar until it softens., If you don't have a food processor, you can use your microwave. Take the hardened sugar and set it in a microwave safe plastic bag.


Take one square of paper towel and get it wet. Wring it out so it's damp and not dripping.
Place the paper towel with the sugar and seal the bag. Microwave for 20 seconds and then check. If the sugar is not soft, keep microwaving it in 20 minute increments until it softens to your liking., If you don't have a microwave or food processor, you can also use your oven. Heat the oven to 250 degrees. Then, set the brown sugar in a baking pan. Bake for 5 minutes and then check. If the sugar's still not soft, bake it for another few minutes. Keep going until the sugar gets as soft as you want it.

 Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin from each sweet potato. Cut each one into 1/2-in. (1.27-cm) cubes. Place these cubes in a colander and rinse with running water to remove any traces of dirt.
 Fill the pot with enough water to cover the cubes. Add a dash of salt to the water.
 You can add a pinch of salt to the pot if you like. Cover the pot and heat the water and cubed sweet potatoes over medium-high to high heat, until they feel tender when pierced with a fork.
 Pour the contents of the pot through a colander. Separate the water out and return the potatoes to the pot.
 You can add anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 ml) of butter, depending on how creamy you want the mashed sweet potatoes to be. Allow the butter to sit on the hot sweet potatoes until it melts, stirring as necessary to speed up the melting process.
 Smash the sweet potatoes and butter together using the masher until the mixture becomes smooth.









If you do not have a potato masher, you can also use a hand-held electric mixer.
 Stir in 1/3 cup (80 ml) of sour cream and 1/4 cup (60 ml) of milk and add salt and pepper to taste. Continue stirring with a large spoon or fork until the mixture is creamy and thoroughly combined.
 Cook the mashed sweet potatoes over low heat, stirring frequently, until the sweet potatoes are heated through. Then, serve them while they're hot.

 Fresh trees are less flammable and less likely to ignite; whereas dry trees can catch fire when they come into contact with very warm or hot lights.


Purchase a fire-resistant or flame-retardant tree if you decide on an artificial tree instead of a live tree.
 Heat sources such as radiators, space heaters, fireplaces, and heat vents can often cause your tree and its electrical decorations to catch fire.
 By maintaining the freshness of your tree throughout the holiday season, you are reducing the risk of an electrical fire that could be caused by decorations igniting a dry tree.

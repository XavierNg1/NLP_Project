 Over the course of your blending, it's easy to accidentally spread color to an area you hadn't intended.

 Prismacolor pencils can be very expensive, so it's a good idea to get the most out of every pencil you purchase. A pencil extender will allow you to hold the end nub of a used pencil more easily so you can use every last bit., Wax is a component used in manufacturing your colored pencils. Over time it can rise to the surface of your drawing to create buildup on the image. This can be removed without harming your artwork by wiping it away firmly with a clean, dry cloth or moderately stiff bristle brush.You'll often find that wax buildup occurs in areas you have heavily applied your colored pencil to a specific area. Keep an eye on these areas for buildup., Prismacolor pencils leave behind marks that can be difficult to erase, though you may have some success with a normal eraser. However, it's likely you'll have the best success with an electric eraser. You can also lift unwanted marks by applying and peeling free adhesive putty, like the kind used to hang posters and artwork.Even with an electric eraser, it's likely some remnant of the Prismacolor will remain. Avoid erasing too much to try and completely erase the mark. Doing so could result in a ripped page., The colored cores of your Prismacolors are relatively fragile and can break from dropping or rough handling. These breaks can result in inconsistent drawing or wasted lead, so you may want to keep your pencils in a box or case to keep them protected.

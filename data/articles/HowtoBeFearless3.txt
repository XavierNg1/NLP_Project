 Don't set your sights on small achievements. Live boldly by reaching for the stars! When you set a big goal, (rather than a small one) you are more likely to get excited. This makes your short-term actions more productive, and improves your life. Even if you never reach that big dream you imagined, when you fall short, you'll be much better off than when you started.If you don't have a goal in mind, ask yourself, "What have I always wanted to do?"
Some big goals might include: running a marathon, climbing a mountain, earning a certain amount of money, traveling abroad, earning a degree/certification, writing a book, or losing weight.
 Once you've set your sights on a goal, you must make a plan. Break your goal down into smaller, step-by-step goals. Give each of these small goals deadlines. Think about what obstacles might stand in your way, and think about how you can overcome them.For example, if you want to take a trip, you first need to save money. Create a plan for how you will earn extra money, and how much you will save each month until you reach your goal.
If you want to lose weight, choose an approach to diet and exercise and give yourself concrete deadlines.
 Boldness is the opposite of hesitation. Once you have your plan in place, you have to take the leap. Seek out a community of people who are seeking the same goal, and use them to keep you motivated and accountable.Keep yourself motivated by celebrating small victories.
 Many people hold themselves back from doing things because they are afraid to fail. The truth is: everyone fails. Fearless people just aren't afraid of that inevitable downfall. Learn to embrace and expect failure, and use it as a learning experience.For instance, if you are a writing, you could set the goal of receiving 20 rejection letters per year.
If you are an athlete, compete in a tournament you know you probably won't win.
If you never fail, you are never really pushing your edge.

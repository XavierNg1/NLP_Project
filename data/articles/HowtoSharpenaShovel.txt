 You will need steel wool, an emery cloth or a manufactured rust remover in order to prep the shovel for sharpening. You will also need a 10- or 12-inch mill bastard file. All of these materials can be found at your local hardware store.;
, Gently scrub the surface of the shovel until any vestige of rust has been removed. This is an important step, as filing a rusty surface will dull the file resulting in ineffective sharpening.
 Ensure the upper surface of the blade, or the concave side, is accessible. If you do not have access to a vice or clamps, grip the shovel between your knees and attempt to keep it as sturdy as possible.
 You will sharpen the leading edge, or the one that feels noticeably sharper to the touch.
 You should form a bevel of about 70 degrees to the upper surface of the shovel. Avoid drawing the file backward.

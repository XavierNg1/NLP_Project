 Lay a small scrap of felt over the top of any flat hair clip. Trim the felt so that it roughly matches the length and width of the clip.


Alligator clips, blank barrettes, and snap clips will all work for this project. The clip you choose simply needs to have a flat top. It will also be easier to work with if it is at least 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) long.
As you trim the felt, try to match the shape and dimensions of the clip as closely as possible. The felt should completely cover the top of the clip. It can overhang a little on all sides, but not by more than 1/4 inch (0.6 cm).
 Apply a thin line of hot glue over the top of the hair clip. Gently press the felt onto the glue.


Only apply glue to the top surface of the clip. Do not allow any of the glue to drip onto the hinged bottom portion.
Make sure that the felt is centered over the hair clip. Use your thumb to quickly smooth out any wrinkles or bumps, then allow the glue to dry before handling the clip further.
 Use scissors to trim the tips off approximately one dozen clean craft feathers. The length of each trimmed portion should be roughly one-fourth to one-third the total length of your felt strip.


You can experiment with different feathers and felt, but as a general rule, this hair clip will look best when you use one type/color of feather. Pair it with felt that roughly matches the same color.
 Layer the snipped feather pieces over the felt strip. Glue each feather piece onto the felt by apply a dot of hot glue to the base.


Start your way at the top of the clip and gradually work your way down. Each horizontal layer should consist of two or three feather pieces, and the feathers should slightly overlap one another, hiding most of the felt from view.
Only apply a small dot of glue to the base of each feather piece before sticking it onto the felt. The top and side of each feather should remain fairly loose and free.
 Once all of the glue cools and dries, the hair clip should be ready to wear.

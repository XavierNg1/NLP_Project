 Sometimes it is necessary to try new things in order to discover things that you excel at. Trying and succeeding at new things can also help you to build your self-confidence. Take class at your local community college, join a sports club in your area, or volunteer. Just make sure that whatever you try is something you want to try, but that is also completely new for you., You may have a habit of comparing yourself to others and getting down on yourself because your successes do not seem to be as good as other people’s successes. Work on stopping this habit. Instead of focusing on what other people have or do, focus on what you have accomplished., Exercise, healthy food, rest, and relaxation are all important components in good self-confidence. By taking good care of yourself, you are sending your mind signals that you deserve to be taken care of. Make sure that you are devoting enough time to meeting your basic needs for exercise, food, sleep, and relaxation.Aim for 30 minutes of exercise per day.

Get 8 hours of sleep per night.
Set aside at least 15 minutes per day to practice yoga, do deep breathing exercises, or meditate.

Telling your friends that you have been struggling with your self-confidence can also lead to a more positive and supportive network of friends.If you want to talk to your friends about your attempts to build up your self-confidence, start with something like, “Lately I have been struggling with low self-confidence, so I may not seem like myself right now.”

, If you find that your self-confidence does not improve or that it is severely low, you may want to seek help from a mental health professional. A therapist may be able to provide more help than you can provide for yourself.

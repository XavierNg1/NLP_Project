 Put a kettle of water on to boil. Use a sharp knife to slice one lemon in half. Cut a circular slice about Â¼ inch thick. If you like, you can take one of the halves, squeeze out the juice and add that to your beverage with the slice. Set the slice aside for now.
 Place both ingredients into a mug. If you have a sore throat, the honey can help to coat and soothe it.
 Once the water begins to boil, remove it from heat and pour it over the honey and bourbon. Drop the lemon slice into the mug, along with one cinnamon stick and three whole cloves. Cinnamon can help relieve pain from a sore throat. It's also very high in antioxidants and the scent of cinnamon can help to open up clogged sinuses.The cloves can relieve pain and they have antibacterial properties, too.
Do not substitute clove oil for the whole cloves. The oil might upset your stomach.
 Stir the liquid gently with the cinnamon stick or a spoon. Let it steep. Sprinkle the drink with nutmeg and serve immediately. Stir the beverage once more. Take a pinch of nutmeg and sprinkle it over the top and serve the beverage immediately.


Feel free to remove the cloves before consuming, although they are perfectly safe to swallow and may provide additional health benefits.You can always add lemon juice or additional honey to taste, if you like.

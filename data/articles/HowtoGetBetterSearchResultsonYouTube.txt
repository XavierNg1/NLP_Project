 If you are looking for "hilarious cat videos that involve small children" then that's too long. YouTube searches for videos with the words that you searched. That's why when you search it, some words on the info or title are bold. So your searching the cat/children videos, try "funny cats". most video's already HAVE small children.;
, There a a lot of people who put things on YouTube, so it takes about 60 minutes or so for someone to put a brand new music video or some other kind of thing.
 If you don't know, ask someone who does! If you go up and ask someone, "Are there any videos that you like? Can you tell me them?"





, If you see a video in the homepage, it might as well have GOOD VIDEO, WATCH IT! on it.

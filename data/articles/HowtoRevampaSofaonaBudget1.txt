 A “slipcover” is a commercially made cover for your sofa. In order to purchase the right one, you will need to measure your sofa. Using a tape measure, record the width and length of your couch, as well as the length of the arms. Additionally, you should look for any labels on your sofa. If you can determine the manufacturer and/or specific style of your sofa, you may be able to find a slipcover made especially for it.It can also be helpful to take a photo on your cell phone.
You can show this image to a retail employee, and they may be able to help you select the right product.;
, Look for your new slipcover at big box, home supply, fabric, or upholstery stores. Additionally, if you know the manufacturer of your sofa (such as Ikea), you can visit that manufacturer directly (in person or online). Search for a slipcover that fits the size and style of your sofa, as well as the look and feel of your home.


Slipcovers vary widely in terms of cost.
You may find them for as little as $60 (from some big box stores), or as much as $600 (from some furniture retailers).
 Slipcovers are extremely appealing because they are easy to use. Simply open your new slipcover, remove any pillows or loose items from your sofa, and drape your slipcover over. Often times, there will be ties, Velcro, or other fasteners that will help you to tighten and secure your slipcover. Be sure to read any instructions that come included with your new slipcover., You can use throw pillows and/or a throw blanket to finish the look. You can find these items at big box or furniture stores, or look at thrift stores or resale shops to stick to your budget.

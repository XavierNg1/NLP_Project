 White vinegar can be used to wipe any stains off of plantation shutters. Fill a small bowl with white vinegar only. The precise amount you need depends on the size of your shutters and how much cleaning they need., For easiest cleaning, you will wipe down your shutters with a sock or cotton gloves. Find a clean, fresh sock or glove and dip it in the white vinegar. Wring the sock or glove out until it's just barely damp., Place your sock or glove over your hand. Run the sock or glove over each blind slowly. The white vinegar should remove dirt, debris, and any stains. For very dirty shutters, have another sock or glove on hand if the one you use gets dirty., Wipe down each blind as many times as you need for the sock or glove to run clean. The final time you wipe, there should be no new dirt or debris on your sock or glove. The shutters should be looking much cleaner when you're done.Remember to switch which sock or glove you're using if your sock or glove becomes very dirty. It's important not to simply rub dirt around on the shutters.

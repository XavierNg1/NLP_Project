 Namely, wear it on your back, with all parts doing what they're supposed to do.;
, Place a strap over each arm so that the straps sit evenly across each shoulder. Wearing the bag on only one shoulder causes strain and will make your posture lopsided. Check that the strap length works well; if not, adjust until maximum comfort is reached.
 These straps are designed to help keep the bag snug against you and move with you easily. This reduces the pull of the bag.


Tighten the straps firmly without being constricting.
 Pack the lightest items at the top. Everything else should be ranged by weight in between.


If you are a strong teen or adult, keep a school or day backpack under 20 kg; if you are a child, keep it under 10 kg.
Place as much as possible inside the backpack. Having things in the bag is always better than holding items.
 Does the backpack feel good? If not, make adjustments.

 In order for your cat to get adequate rest (and to prevent infection), it is important for her to stay indoors (where you can keep an eye on her) for at least two weeks. Close any open cat-doors, and keep your cat inside., A c-section is an invasive surgery. Your cat will have staples or stitches, and she will be very sore. She may not be able to jump or climb stairs for a little while. Ensure that everything your cat needs remains on one floor of your house, and make sure she can easily access all amenities. You may want to:

Relocate food and water bowls.
Relocate litter boxes.
 During the first few hours after your cat returns home, keep a close eye on her. She may still be drowsy and weak, and could fall and hurt herself (or one of the kittens). Kittens should not be left alone with her until she is fully revived, able to stand on her own without stumbling, and shows an interest in taking care of them.Until the mother cat is ready to care for the babies, ensure that they are kept warm.
Place them in a box with a blanket. If your house is especially cold, you can include a heating pad on a low setting.

 The more you practice the more the music and the notes become easier to play.;
, You want to be at the right speed and not buzzing ahead or dropping behind, you and others would get confused!

, Go to every single rehearsal, or as many as you can to help your group get used to playing with each other.
 What you're wearing to perform is very important. You might have to wear something specific, such as a tuxedo. Get all this stuff before the day of the concert.
 Try not to do anything last minute, like changing the strings the day of the concert.
 Remember you are the ones in the concert, and not attending it.
 Have fun and do not think about how many people are watching you. Just make believe you are only practicing with the band. The audience usually claps no matter what.

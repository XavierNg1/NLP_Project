 If you don't know how to do something, ask a coach or a team member. Your coach will help if you ask but will likely be really annoyed if you assume to know everything but are just making it up as you go.


When coaches try to talk to you, let them. They may teach you something that could help out a lot. They'll certainly notice if you're unwilling to listen and learn; that can be a sign of being a poor team player.
 Right when you step on the softball field, it is game time! Hustle on and off of the field.
 This can infect you, the team and your coach. Stay positive, even when the chips are down.


If the coaches see you working really hard they will have a positive attitude about you.
If you see someone else down, cheer them up and be someone that people look up to.
 At least get your three cuts in, and swing the bat.

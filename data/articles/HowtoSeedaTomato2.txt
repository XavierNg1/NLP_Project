 If you need to seed tomatoes for a salad, cut them in neat sections so they can be easily mixed in with the greens. To start, slice the tomato in half vertically, moving the knife from the stem to the bottom.Cut the two halves in half. You should cut along the white portions of the tomato dividing the halves.
You should be left with four wedges of tomato that are roughly the same size.
 Take a sharp knife from your kitchen. You should go for a small knife, as you'll be targeting tiny sections. Run the knife between the outer layer of the tomato and the cluster of seeds in one even motion. Do this with all four wedges.If any seeds remain on the tomato after you sliced it, you can use your fingers or a spoon to remove any excess seeds.Throw away the seeds when you're finished unless you plan to use them to plant a tomato plant.
 Mix them in with the greens and other vegetables. If you want, you can cut up these slivers of tomatoes into smaller chunks, to help them disperse more evenly throughout the salad.

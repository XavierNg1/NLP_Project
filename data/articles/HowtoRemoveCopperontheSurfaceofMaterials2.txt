 Add your copper coated material to a glass beaker. If it is too large to fit in a beaker, use a glass tub or tray. Place the glass container outside or underneath a fume hood before proceeding.Plastics and many metals will be dissolved using this method. Only place items that are made from gold, platinum, iron, nickel, aluminum, chromium, or cobalt in the beaker.
 Pour concentrated nitric acid in the beaker. You should pour enough to cover the surface of the material that you are cleaning. You will see a dark gas form above the surface of the liquid. This is nitrogen dioxide gas.Nitric acid is a strong acid. Wear gloves and goggles. Do not get the acid on your skin or in your eyes. Do not inhale fumes from the acid, and do not ingest it.
Nitrogen dioxide is toxic. This must be done in a fume hood or other well ventilated area. Do not inhale the nitrogen dioxide.
If you do get the acid on your skin or eyes, wash with water for 15 minutes.
 When the reaction has completed, pour water into the beaker or flask. This will dilute the copper ions and create a light blue color. It will also dilute any excess acid and allow you to retrieve the remaining material.You should use tongs to remove the material. Do not put your hand in the solution!
The reaction is complete when no more gas is being formed.

 Sometimes it’s hard to see why being kind and helpful to others also helps us. Everything in our culture tells us that to get ahead, we need to fight only for ourselves and forget everyone else. But in helping others, we not only create a sense of deep personal fulfillment but we also ensure that other people want to help us. You will be surprised how willing people are to help you when you are widely known as a good, helpful, self-sacrificing person.
 Networking is a great way to move yourself up in the world and get the things you want for your life. Make lots of friends. Meet people that are in well-placed positions in environments where you would like to work. Show everyone you meet how hard you work and how good you are with others. Show them the incredible skills you’ve built. Everyone will be itching to recommend you for opportunities they see crop up.
 Marriage and children are not for everybody, but most people will not feel fulfilled without some kind of companionship. Especially as we age, it’s easy to become lonely, as friendships tend to fade as others become more attached to their families. Build a support network, whether it’s a spouse, life-long partner, children, pets, or strong sibling relationships.

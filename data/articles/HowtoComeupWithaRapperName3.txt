 You don't have to stick to a name just because you say it out loud – especially if you're just starting out. Say your name at the beginning of a rap to see how it sounds. If you reference yourself in the flow of your rap, make sure to refer to yourself by your new rapper name. Ensure that it's catchy – something that people will remember.Record yourself and listen over the tapes. If you like the way that it sounds, then keep it. If you don't like the way that it sounds, then try to come up with something else.
 Perhaps there are several aspects of your personality that come through when you rap. Try to stick to one "stage name" – but feel free to reference "characters" and versions of yourself when you rap. Eminem, for instance, often refers to himself as "Slim Shady" to express the rougher, meaner side of his personality., If you're having trouble deciding, ask someone you trust for his or her advice. Ask a friend, a sibling, or another rapper. You don't have to take anybody's advice – but it might help you solidify your own opinion.
 Sometimes, the best way to form an opinion on something is to try it out. You can always change your rapper name if doesn't stick!

 Ammonia is one of the most powerful cleaning tools you can use, and it’s found in a lot of the cleaners you use around your house. You can use it alone to fight those stubborn stains that don’t seem to budge with soap alone. You can purchase ammonia wherever you buy the rest of your housecleaning supplies.
 It’s important to blot the stain, rather than scrub, so you don’t risk smearing the stain or damaging the carpet fibers. Continue to press the ammonia and water solution into the stain and it should start to fade. Blot the stain until it’s fully absorbed into the carpet, and the stain has faded or disappeared to your satisfaction.Do this in a well-ventilated area, because ammonia can have a pretty strong odor. Don’t worry, it won’t smell after it dries., Let it air dry so that the odor dissipates completely. After it’s completely dry, examine the spot and determine if you need to repeat these steps.Vacuum over the area after it’s dry to make sure the freshly-cleaned area is blended into the rest of the carpet.


Ammonia is not safe for pets. Make sure that you keep pets away from the area you are cleaning with the ammonia solution.

You might be on an obstacle course. This is a good way to practice your controls- You use the WASD or arrow keys to move, spacebar to jump, and you can scroll or use the I and O keys to zoom in and out.;
, For example: There are some rocket launchers that fire multiple rockets with spaces in between. Practice with the admin of a level. Get them to shoot it at you and you stay still...don't lose it.
 When you get cornered, turn around slashing madly.If you are the attacker, watch out for the attack bust when he's cornered.
 Roblox lags madly and in the worst of cases may crash due to poor servers.
, People might want to become your friend more often if you are nice, and helpful. People don't want to be friends with people who say things like "lol, figure it out yourself noob!"

, But don't get many Wipeouts! You could even try to get the famous Bloxxer badge!

Always go in first person.
If there are kill cams,Â use them to your advantage to see where the enemy killed you at.
Don't blame your teammates; it is rare that they are that bad that you need to blame them for your loss, prevent fighting with them!

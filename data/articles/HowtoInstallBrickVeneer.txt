Height: each brick is approximately 2 inches (5.08 cm) in height and you will want to leave about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) joint in between each layer of brick laid. Each layer is called a course and a joint is the space between each brick on either side as well as the space between each course. When added together, this will result in a height of about 2 1/2 inches (6.35 cm) per course.
Length: each brick is approximately 8 inches (20.32 cm) in length and, again, you will want to leave about a 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) joint between each brick in the course.
The following steps will be an example of how to build a 4 foot (1.21 m) tall by 10 foot (3.03 m) wide brick veneer; 4 feet (1.21 m) equals 48 inches (121.92 cm) and 10 feet (3.03 m) equals 120 inches (304.8 cm).
When you divide the height of the wall, 48 inches (121.92 cm), by the height of the brick and the course's joint, 2 1/2 inches (6.35 cm), you will get an approximation of how many courses you will need. In this example, the result is about 20 to 21 courses, depending on which measuring system you are using.
When you divide the length of the wall, 120 inches (304.8 cm), by the length of each brick and the joints in between, 8 inches (20.32 cm) per brick plus the 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) joints, you will get approximately 15 bricks per course.
Multiply how many courses necessary for the brick wall cover by how many bricks you will need per course; this will result in how many total bricks you will need to purchase for the entire brick veneer. For this example, round up to 21 courses and multiply by 15 bricks per course; this comes out to 315 bricks.
On average, it takes about 60 pounds (27 kg) of mortar per 120 bricks. Mortar is a thick cement-like paste used to bind the bricks to each other. To calculate the amount of mortar you need, divide the number of bricks you will need times the 120 brick average, then multiply by the 60 pounds (27 kg) of mortar average. For this example, you will divide 315 bricks by 120 bricks and multiply by 60 pounds (27 kg) of mortar; this results in 157.5 pounds (70.88 kg) of mortar.
If veneering more than 1 side of a wall, calculate your total amount of materials by multiplying your total number of bricks and mortar per wall by how many walls you are covering.;
, This will prevent the bricks from soaking up too much mortar during the construction process., If you are veneering more than 1 wall, it is imperative to extend the veneer further than the wall itself. This will establish corners, connect each side of the brick wall to itself, and ensure the wall covering comes out straight., A screed is an aluminum tool used to flatten and smooth out pasty, cement-like materials such as mortar.,,, This ensures your brick courses will all have equal heights throughout construction as well as keeping the wall veneer straight. Do this by starting the next 3 brick courses along the end or corner of the veneer. These courses should only be portions of the next 3 courses, so only build 1/3 (or 5 bricks) into each of these lead courses., This will help you make sure your joints and courses are straight by lining up the corner of each course to the string line., This tool creates a round indent in the mortar making it more stable as well as stylish.,

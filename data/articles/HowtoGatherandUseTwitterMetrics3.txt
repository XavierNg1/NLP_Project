, For example, let's say you want to see how much traffic your Twitter updates drive to your blog. Select your blog in Google Analytics.
,, (If you see Twitter in the table, do not click on it as you will not get a clear picture as Twitter.com does not include mobile Twitter and Twitter search.)A new chart and table will appear. Below is an example of such a box from Fan History Wiki at fanhistory.com.
 In the case of our sample, the Twitter account (fanhistorywiki) sent 157 visitors per month to the website in question. The Twitter account, as of this writing, has 2901 followers.
 In the FanHistory example above, the site only receives a disappointing 0.05 visits per follower in a month period. Some higher benchmarks include wikiHow at 1.98 visits per follower or TechCrunch at .6 visits/follower. ). If your number is above 1.0 visits per follower per month, you are probably delivering compelling information for your followers. If your number is well below that, you are not doing so well and you may want to consider changing your Twitter strategy.

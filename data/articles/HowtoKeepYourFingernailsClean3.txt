 Use sharp manicure scissors or nail clippers to cut your nails. First, trim your nails into a straight line. Next, cut the edges into gentle curves so that they aren’t sharp. Cut your nails as short or as long as you’d like. However, keep in mind that shorter nails are easier to keep clean.If you’re worried about infection, sanitize your clippers before using them by dipping them in rubbing alcohol.
 Choose a standard nail file, also called a 240 grit nail file. This grit is best for natural fingernails.Next, file your freshly cut nails by swiping the file in the direction of your nail growth. You can also file your nails by swiping the file back and forth. However, this can cause damage to weak nails.


If you’d like, you can use a nail buffer. However, this is not a good option for people with thin nails.
 Clear nail polish, also known as a top coat, will make your nails shine with cleanliness. Similarly, a nail strengthener will give your fingernails a glossy sheen while repairing nail damage. Brush a thin layer of a top coat or strengthener onto your nails and let it dry for ten minutes.


Top coats and nail strengtheners don’t look like nail polish when applied. Therefore, this step is useful for everyone, regardless of nail polish preference.

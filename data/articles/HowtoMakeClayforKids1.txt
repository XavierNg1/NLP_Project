 You'll need:









1 cup salt
2 cups flour
2 tablespoons cream of tartar
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Food coloring, optional
2 cups boiling water;
, Stir together the salt, flour, and cream of tartar in a large bowl until they're well mixed.
 Make a well in the middle of your dry ingredients and pour the oil and food color in the center.
 Pour the water over all the ingredients in your bowl and stir the mixture well. You may not need to put all the water in.









Use caution when heating the water and pouring the boiling liquid.
 This will allow the flour to absorb some of the water and let the clay set up.
 Remove the clay from the bowl and form it into a ball. Knead it for a few minutes until the clay is smooth.
 If you store dyed clay in a plastic container, be aware that the clay may stain. The dough should keep for a few weeks, if sealed well.

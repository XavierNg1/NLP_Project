Note that these creatures dwell in holes in the ground in many areas. They are venomous (mildly) as most spiders, but beware that their fangs can be quite large and a bite can be quite painful.
Note that they are nocturnal (they hunt at night), so if you want to find them out of their lairs, look for them in the early morning when they are heading back toward their hole. You may find them out and about during the daytime and at certain times.
 Sometimes a gentle touch on the rear of their large abdomen will cause them to move quickly forward into the jar.


Do not touch them toward their front, where their eyes and fangs are. Read up on them beforehand.

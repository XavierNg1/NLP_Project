 Weasleys are happy, cheerful and optimistic. They always smile. Percy was not a jumpy type, but he always was proud of his achievements. Fred and George were always laughing, and Ginny was the feisty girl. Ronald also had nice laughs, and Bill and Charlie were brave and daring. And Mrs. And Mr. Weasley were always joking. So smile, and let others do the same.;
, The Weasleys were known for flaming red hair. If you have blonde hair, you can leave it. However, it makes you a true Weasley if you have their hair. Dye your hair, or even wear a wig. If you don't want to dye your hair, that's fine. Remember hygiene, and be proud of it., The Weasleys were quite pretty. Have some mascara and maybe a little eyeshadow if you're a girl, but don't overdo it. Ginny never cakes her face up in make-up.Always try to look after your hygiene.

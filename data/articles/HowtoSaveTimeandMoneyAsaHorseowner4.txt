 Know how long it takes to walk from the tack, feed and rug rooms to the stables, and from the stables to the muck heap. Draw a plan of this to see if there are any ways that you can reconfigure things to speed up the access and time taken. Or, find more efficient ways of completing each task so that you're not doubling back all the time.
 Things will run more smoothly on a day-to-day basis and makes it easier to keep the yard in good shape in between.
 Small repairs usually turn into big repairs if you leave them. Fill in potholes that might tip over the wheelbarrow, re-hang gates and doors that are difficult to open and close. Keep a list of repairs you've noticed and attend to it at least weekly. Carry a hammer and wire-cutters when walking the yard and bang in or remove loose wires and nails that are sticking out. This will reduce the chances for torn horse covers and horse legs, saving you a lot of money for little effort.
 This will leave less debris and mud heaped up and makes it a less messy job for you.

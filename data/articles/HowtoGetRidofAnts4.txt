 Since ants are tiny, they can find thousands of tiny doorways into your residence. Some of these are easy to identify, while others will only be discovered when there's a parade of ants marching through the chosen ant doorway.
 Seal windows, doors and any cracks the ants crawl through with caulk. An additional benefit of doing this is better temperature control and lower energy bills. Plus, it's one of the least risky methods when kids or pets are involved.
 Salt, chalk, baby powder and talc can be spread under doors, near windows and walls.


Keep in mind that there are concerns about the potential carcinogenicity of talc., Vinegar, peppermint oil, cinnamon, black pepper, cayenne pepper, whole cloves, and bay leaves are all examples that have varying claims of success.However, some of these might be harmful to pets and irritants to curious children.
 Ants often enter homes through nearby shrubs, vegetation, or overhanging trees. To eliminate this problem, create a dry, plant-free border by trimming or getting rid of overhanging trees, cutting back vegetation that is touching your home, and laying down a perimeter of gravel or rock.

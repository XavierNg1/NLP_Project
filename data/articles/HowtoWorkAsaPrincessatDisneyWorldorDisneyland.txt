 To be a Disney princess, you must be 18-27 years old and stand 5'3'-5'7' tall. There have been princesses a little bit taller, so don't freak out if you are 6'. They may still let you in. If you are 5' or shorter, don't let this crush your dreams. You can play Tinkerbell, or Alice in Wonderland or Wendy Darling. You must also speak English and be able to work in the United States. If you're from another country, you'll need a passport and work visa.

, At Disney auditions, you will be asked to do an 8-count dance. Its very simple, and the purpose of it is to see how comfortable you are, so keep smiling the whole time and make it look like you know what you're doing. You will also be asked to do a charade. Example: pretend to be washing a truck. Be as animated as you can, because remember you're bringing a character to life!

,, You must wear comfortable clothes. If you have dancing shoes, wear them. Don't wear heavy makeup, because Disney wants to see your natural face, not a painting of it. Having your hair in a ponytail makes it easier, too. If you have glasses, wear contact lenses.
 In your head-shot, wear simple makeup and smile. Make sure the lighting is just right and there isn't anything going on in the background of your photo.
 When they ask what your name is, just say your name. Don't say which Disney princess you wish to play, since it's possible you could play several different characters.
 It is typical for a prospective princess to audition multiple times before being hired. However, Disney does not allow more than one audition every six months.

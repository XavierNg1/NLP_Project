 A document cannot be entered into evidence unless someone lays a foundation for it. This means that the person offering the evidence must produce testimony sufficient to prove that the item is what the party claims it is.For example, a person cannot just get up on the stand and argue that a photograph shows you hitting another car in an intersection. The witness must first establish: that the photograph is actually of the intersection in which the accident occurred; how she knows that it is the intersection (e.g., she drives through it daily), and how she knows the day and time the photograph was taken. If a witness fails to make these connections, then she has failed to lay a proper foundation, and the evidence may be excluded by the court. The judge will ultimately determine whether the witness has provided sufficient evidence.
Some documents are self-authenticating. For example, domestic records that are sealed and signed, certified copies of public records, newspapers and magazines, as well as acknowledged (notarized) documents do not require a foundation., Generally, a duplicate is admissible. But you can challenge its admissibility if you argue that it is not authentic, or that only a partial duplicate of the original is being offered., For example, if in a criminal trial the prosecution sent off the murder weapon to the lab to test for fingerprints, then the defendant should look through all of the reports describing the movement of the weapon.


If the defendant can find a time when the gun is not accounted for as being in police custody, then the chain of custody is broken. The defendant could move to have the evidence thrown out.

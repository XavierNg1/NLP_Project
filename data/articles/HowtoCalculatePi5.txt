 This is because the Arcsin function is undefined for arguments greater than 1 or less than -1.



pi = 2 * (Arcsin(sqrt(1 - x^2)) + abs(Arcsin(x))).

Arcsin refers to the inverse sine in radians
Sqrt is is short for square root
Abs is short for absolute value
x^2 refers to an exponent, in this case, x squared.

 As is the case with Facebook, canonical pages may not exist. Also, some celebrities maintain a personal as well as a media or company Twitter account, and it can be difficult deciding which one to use. Look for the account with the blue check mark (specifically, white check mark with a blue background) and with the larger number of followers.
 Compare with competing topics. You can see the page's total number of followers at the top, and you can examine the number of retweets and favorites under any given tweet they've posted.


Make corrections for the large number of fake followers on Twitter. Twitter has a fairly large problem of fake accounts, more so than Facebook, partly because Twitter, by design, does not focus on real identity and does not require a user to have only one account.There are a few different online tools you can use to estimate the extent to which a Twitter account's followers are fake. The numbers are based on heuristics used by these websites and may not be accurate. One such tool, that allows you to enter any Twitter account, is Twitter Audit.,


You can type the words into Twitter's search bar and select to see either top tweets or all tweets. Scrolling through the list of tweets can give an idea of the frequency with which people reference the topic.

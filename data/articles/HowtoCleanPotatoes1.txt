 Be sure to wash your hands first using an antibacterial soap, and to rinse them well. You don't want to transfer any bacteria to your clean potatoes.Wash the potatoes just before you plan to cook and eat them. Do not wash the potatoes before storing them, as this could lead to early rot and spoilage.;
, Organic potatoes may be free of chemicals and pesticides, but they will still be covered with dirt and bacteria. You also want to wash potatoes that you plan on peeling. If you don't wash them first, you might end up dragging some of the bacteria or dirt onto the flesh when you go to peel them., Try to avoid using the same scrubber you use for your dishes. It may contain some soap residue, which might get onto the potato.


If you don't have a vegetable scrubbing brush, find a clean sponge with a scratchy, scrubby side, and use that instead.
 Focus on any dirty areas as well as the eyes, where most of the dirt collects.Do not use any soaps, detergents, or produce cleaners. You may not end up getting all of the residue off. Also, research has proven that a simple scrubbing is pretty effective.If you notice any sprouts, pull them off. Don't leave them on the potato.
 Overtime, the scrubber may start to turn off-color. If this happens, simply rinse both the scrubber and the potato under water.
 If you have a white dish scrubber, you can wait until it stops getting off-color. If you don't, wait until the potato is a few shades lighter. It may have splotches of different colors. That's fine.
 This can help remove any leftover dirt and bacteria.

 Senegal parrots need roomy cages. The minimum size is 20 inches (50.8 cm) long by 20 inches (50.8 cm) deep by 28 inches (71.12 cm) high (for one parrot), but bigger is always better. Due to their clever dispositions, pick a escape-proof one (though some Senegal parrot owners may realize "escape-proof" isn't necessarily true)., Parrot toys are very necessary. Get lots of them, including puzzle toys and disposable/destroyable toys. Finally, you'll want to add some other essentials, such as food and water containers (preferably stainless steel), a seed guard, and wooden and rope perches., High-quality pellets should make up about 70% of your Senegal's diet. Healthy veggies--like kale, broccoli, parsley, and hot/sweet peppers--should make up about 20% more. Special treats--like fruits, nuts, and small amounts of dairy--should make up no more than ten percent. Never feed your Senegal junk food, chocolate, or avocado., Parrots have a natural tendency to hide any pain or sickness as long as they can. To help catch any problems early on, it is crucial to bring your Senegal in for an annual check-up. The vet can also trim your Senegal's nails and wings.Your vet is likely to suggest doing expensive (but potentially) life-saving blood tests at your regular check-up.
Trimming your Senegal's nails is necessary, and trimming their wings is mandatory for the safety of you and your Senegal.
 Senegal parrots need a lot of attention. If you own a single Senegal parrot, they will need 1-3 hours of your attention each day. This time should spend out of the cage.If you have two parrots, they can keep each other company and you may not need to pay as much attention to them.
Never force your parrot out of the cage when it doesn't want to go.

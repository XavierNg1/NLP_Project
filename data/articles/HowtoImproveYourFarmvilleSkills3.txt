 This is also a good way to develop your farm as you level up. Not only will buildings add to the pleasing overall appearance of your property, but putting them up gets you a considerable amount of experience. Some buildings are also useful for either keeping animals (as discussed above), or for storage of excess inventory. Either way, though, making building up your farm a priority will help you level up more quickly, as well as improving the overall aesthetic quality of your property.

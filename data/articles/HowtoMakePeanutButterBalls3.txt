 Be sure to stir constantly to prevent the bottom from scorching. Once the mixture is completely melted and combined, move to a wide-brimmed bowl.
 Or throw the ball into the bowl and roll around with a fork (so long as you avoid using your fingers), if you'd like 'em even more chocolate-y. Let drip over the bowl and place on wax paper or in a cupcake liner.
 The chocolate needs to set and the peanut butter becomes more solid (and delicious) when cold.

 Check the feeder carefully on all sides. See if you notice any cracks that are causing leaks. Leaks are one of the easiest ways to attract ants. If you notice any leaks, get a replacement feeder., Each time you add new feed to the hummingbird feeder, wipe down the exterior to remove any built up sugar residue. Ants are attracted to sugar residue, so cleaning the feeder can keep them away.Wipe the feeder down using very hot water, but make sure the water is not hot enough to burn your hands.Keep wiping the feeder until all the sugar residue is gone.
 Homemade hummingbird nectar is generally one parts sugar to four parts water. However, to deter ants, try using slightly less than one part sugar. Hummingbirds will still feed on the nectar but less sugar will draw in less ants.

 If they ask for your username and password, don't tell! They will hack you, and steal all your items.;
, Make sure your password contains at least some capital letters, numbers, and symbols so it will be harder to guess. Try to make it something that's not typical of you to make it even harder to guess. If you speak a language other than English, you could try making your password in that language to prevent most people from guessing your password. Changing your password once a month will make it harder for people to guess your password.
 If you do, you can go on the other if you are hacked. Store some of your rare items on your second account so not all is lost if you are hacked.
 Don't even tell your best friends or siblings your password. The only people you should tell your password to is your parents or legal guardians. It's actually against the Animal Jam rules to give out your password to people other than parents or guardians.
 You can do this in your Parent Dashboard. You can also disable trading and gifting if someone is on your account so they can't transfer your items onto their account.
 To do this, log into the Parent Dashboard and click "Disable" beside "Web account". This will prevent anyone from logging on to your account (including you).
 Sites that claim you'll receive gems, diamonds, or a membership are lying.

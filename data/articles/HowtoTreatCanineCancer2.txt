 In many cases, surgical removal of the lump or mass has the potential to be curative or reduce the risk of the cancer spreading. This is especially true if the cancer is caught early and no malignant cells have spread to other parts of the body.Screening before surgery is important so that a dog doesn't go through surgery unnecessarily. If the cancer has moved all around the dog's body, then surgery is not that useful.
 The surgeon will plan the removal carefully and take wide margins from around the edges of the lesion. This means your dog may go home with a much longer incision and line of sutures than you were anticipating. In addition, in the case of skin lumps, the surgeon will remove an entire layer of soft tissue from beneath the mass, so as to eliminate the possibility of leaving cancer cells that have invaded downwards instead of sideways.You will need to make sure that the incisions are kept clean while they are healing. This means keeping your dog from chewing at its incisions and making sure that it doesn't rub the incision and open it up.
 Sometimes surgery may be undertaken in the full knowledge that it won't be curative, but removing the mass will give the dog more time and a better quality of life. You need to decide whether you want to put your dog through the pain of surgery in order to give it a bit more time. It truly can be worth it, especially for slow growing cancers, but that is not always the case.


Sometimes in these cases, if the cancer cells are sensitive to medical treatment, then surgery is followed up by chemotherapy.
Unfortunately, you also need to take the cost into account. Since veterinary care for cancer can cost a lot, the cost of the surgery versus how much it will potentially help your pet needs to be weighed.

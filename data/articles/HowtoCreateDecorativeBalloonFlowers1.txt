 You will need to make one circular hole that has a diameter of approximately 6” (15cm) and another that has a diameter that is about 4” (10cm) across. Don't worry -- these circles don't have to be cut professionally and the piece of cardstock doesn't have to look nice. You'll only be using the cardstock and holes as a template, not for the final product.

, You may want to select balloons that are the same color to help them look like the petals of the same flower. After you blow up each balloon, hold it at the end to make sure that its center fits through the 6” (15cm) cardboard stock template. If it's too big or too small, inflate or deflate it accordingly. Tie the end of each balloon when you're done.
 The balloons should be a different color from the petals so that they stand out when you put the flower together. After you blow up each balloon, hold it at the end to make sure that its center fits through the 4” (10cm) cardboard stock template. If it's too big or too small, inflate or deflate it accordingly. Tie the end of each balloon when you're done.

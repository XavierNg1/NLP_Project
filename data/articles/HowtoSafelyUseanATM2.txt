 ATMs at banks usually have better surveillance and so avoid tampering by criminals. It is easier for criminals to rig non-bank ATMs at locations like the grocery store, shopping mall, or convenience store., Criminals can insert a blocking device into the card slot which causes your card to jam. Once you re-enter your PIN, the criminals will have access to both your lodged ATM card, and you PIN. When you leave, the criminals will then remove the blocking device and make withdrawals from your account.Criminals will also pose as “good Samaritans” who suggest you re-enter your PIN, or will offer to hold down the cancel button while you enter your PIN. In reality, they’re attempting to memorize your PIN number.
 Card skimmers are devices that are added to the ATM to capture personal information including your account number, PIN, and account balance. They are usually mounted on the side of the machine or right on top of the card entry slot, and resemble normal card slots or scanners. Look for duplicate card scanners or suspicious labels that say “card cleaner” or “slide card here first.”, Criminals place a thin sleeve or other device that will trap your cash when it is dispensed from the cash dispenser. Your transaction will appear to be normal, but you will not receive your cash. Once you walk away (either to alert the bank or out of frustration), the thieves will remove the device and steal your money. If you have a friend nearby, send them for assistance. Otherwise, leave the scene and immediately contact your financial institution.


Avoid using your cell phone while at the ATM. This may put you in a more dangerous situation.

 Election survey scams are another innovation in the scammer's toolbox. Don't fall for them. They're really just a thinly veiled attempt to harvest your personal information.


In an election survey scam, the "pollster" claims to be administering a poll about an upcoming election or about a hot-button political issue. The major red-flag is that the pollster will offer you a prize like a vacation if you complete the survey. They "only" need your credit card information to credit you the money for the vacation.Not only is offering a prize to complete a poll likely to skew the results, no pollster could afford to compensate everyone who takes the poll to the tune of several hundred dollars.
 Oftentimes, a telephone survey scam will actually be composed of two steps. Since most consumers expect a scam to be one discrete event, these can be very tricky to spot.In a two step scam, the scammer calls your number asking to you take a quick survey. The survey will ask questions about spending habits and finances. If you subscribe to your local newspaper, for instance. Once you've completed the survey, the call ends.
It is only a week or two later that the scammer goes in for the kill. They'll call you up posing as a representative from the newspaper, claiming your subscription is about to expire. Then they get your payment information, completing the scam.
 A "cramming" scam occurs when your cellphone account is billed for numerous unauthorized charges. These can be among the most difficult to avoid, and the best course of action is to call your phone company and place restrictions on how new services (like ringtones and apps) can be billed to your account.In a cramming scam, the scammer is only calling to see if your phone-line is active and get basic personal information. They may ask you a few short survey questions to get your name and address, which is sometimes all they need to charge your account.

 These medications, which are only used under a doctor's care, can help soften and dilate the cervix.


Misoprostol, a prostaglandin, is sometimes placed in the vagina (more rarely, it can be taken orally) to soften the cervix. This particular medication is safe and relatively inexpensive, and physicians use it frequently.
Dinoprostone is a similar prostaglandin, which can have the same effect. It can be inserted into the vagina as a suppository or squirted into the opening of the cervix.
Hyaluronidase is an enzyme made from bovine testes. When injected into the cervix, it can soften it and help it dilate. This medication is sometimes used when a patient's cervix has not begun to ripen or dilate at all.
 Oxytocin, the same hormone that your body releases during nipple stimulation or sexual intercourse, can also be delivered through an IV. This method sometimes causes extremely strong uterine contractions and other side effects, so talk to your doctor at length about the pros and cons.

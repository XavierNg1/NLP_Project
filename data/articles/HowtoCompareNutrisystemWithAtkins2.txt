 When you eat a carbohydrate and the bloodstream transports the molecules to your cells, 1 of 3 things may happen:


Carbs may be burned immediately for energy.
Carbs may be stored for the short-term as a compound called glycogen.
Carbs may be stored for the long-term as fat.
 Insulin controls the release of stored fat from fat cells. High levels of insulin from high carbohydrate meals mean that your body burns carbohydrates instead of burning stored fat.
 By lowering the amount of carbs that you consume, you turn on your bodyâ€™s fat-burning engines. As a result, you will lose weight.

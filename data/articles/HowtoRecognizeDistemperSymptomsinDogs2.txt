 One of the most commons ways a dog gets distemper is through exposure to the virus without having an immunity to it. This means that both unvaccinated puppies and unvaccinated older dogs are at risk for the disease.Some dogs have a natural immunity to the disease, but you should not rely on that.Vaccinating helps keep your dog from getting distemper. If the dog contracts the disease, she could die or have lasting neurological or retinal damage., Distemper can be spread through contact with contaminated fluids, like urine, blood, mucus, or saliva. This can happen through physical exposure or contaminated food and water bowls. The disease can also be spread through sneezing or coughing.


Try to separate your dog from infected animals.In very young dogs, keep them away from any areas likely to exposure, like kennels.
 Keeping your dogâ€™s kennel or home area disinfected can help get rid of the virus. This is especially important if your dog interacts with other dogs at public places, like pet stores, parks, or kennels., No medication will cure distemper. Instead, dogs are cured through supportive care. Dogs are given antibiotics to fight secondary infections and fluids to help with dehydration.If the dog recovers, an unfortunate late development can be seizures because of the virus in the dog's brain. Some dogs may recover but develop an old dog encephalopathy in later life, which means they develop a form of dementia brought on by long term low grade inflammation in the brain.

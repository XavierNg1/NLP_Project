 Quantity will never replace quality in the knowing eyes of any teacher. It is always better to write a short but excellent paper than one that is long because it has been filled with fluff and nonsense. Keep that in mind before trying out these methods! In addition, some of the methods listed on this page may be considered to be cheating or intellectual laziness by your institution, and could get you in trouble with your teacher or professor. In some schools, colleges and universities, this could be enough to have you removed, even permanently. Know the rules applicable to your institution and heed them.


It is not advisable to use all of the steps suggested below. It will shriek "obvious attempt at padding out" and you'll get a fail. If your paper ends up being too long (a possibility if you overdo things), then remove some of the steps. Indeed, if you have the opposite problem of writing too much, check you haven't done any of the things suggested here!
Realize that if you can read this, so can your teacher or professor.

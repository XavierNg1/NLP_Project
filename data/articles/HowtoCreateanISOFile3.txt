 After downloading, install it. WinRar is a paid program, but you can use the trial version to create ISOs just fine.
 You will need to select all of the files at once, so it may be easier to put them all in one location. Select all of the files by pressing Ctrl+A.
 Click on the option "Add to archive...".
 After clicking, a new window will appear. Give the archive a name, and make sure it is being saved in .iso format.
 This may take several minutes, especially if there are a lot of large files being added to the ISO file.

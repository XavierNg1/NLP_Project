 Parallel resistance is when the "in" side of 2 or more resistors are connected, and the "out" side of those resistors are connected.


The equation for combining n resistors in parallel is:
Req = 1/{(1/R1)+(1/R2)+(1/R3)..+(1/Rn)}
Here is an example, given R1 = 20 Ω, R2 = 30 Ω, and R3 = 30 Ω.

The total equivalent resistance for all 3 resistors in parallel is:
Req = 1/{(1/20)+(1/30)+(1/30)}
= 1/{(3/60)+(2/60)+(2/60)}
= 1/(7/60)=60/7 Ω = approximately 8.57 Ω.

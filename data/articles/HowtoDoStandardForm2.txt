 In this context, standard form is used as a way to change very large or very small numbers into an abbreviated form.This method is only known as "standard form" in British English. In the United States, this numerical format is usually referred to as "scientific notation."

, Usually, it will either be a very large number or a very small number, but any number with more than one digit to the left of the decimal point can be changed into standard form.



Example A: Change the following into standard form: 429000000000

Example B: Change the following into standard form: 0.0000000078

, Locate the decimal point. Shift it from its current position to a point just to the right of the first integer.


Do not forget where the decimal point originally was while doing this.

Example A: 429000000000 => 4.29

Note that there was no visible decimal point in this problem, but the decimal point was implied at the very end of the whole number.



Example B: 0.0000000078 => 7.8

, Count the number of places you moved the decimal point. This number will become the index.


When you shift the decimal place to the left, the index will be a positive number. When you shift the decimal place to the right, the index will be a negative number.

Example A: The decimal point was moved 11 places to the left, so the index is 11.

Example B: The decimal point was moved nine places to the right, so the index is -9.
 To rewrite the number in standard form, you must write the new numerical value multiplied by 10 raised to the value of your index.



Example A: The standard form of 429000000000 is: 4.29 * 1011


Example B: The standard form of 0.0000000078 is: 7.8 * 10-9

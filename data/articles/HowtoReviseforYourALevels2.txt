 Take an A4 sized notebook and draw a wide margin on the left side of the page, using a ruler and pen.


Then use the ruler and pen to draw a horizontal line about 1/4 of the way from the bottom of the page.
 Use the right hand side of the page to make notes on the topic you are studying, whether it's history, physics or languages.


Try to use clear, straight-forward language to keep your notes concise and easy-to-read.
 On the left side of the page, write down some questions relating to the information on the right side of the page.


Coming up with your own questions will help to clarify the meaning of the notes, reveal the relationships between ideas and allow you to commit the information to memory.
The questions could be something like "In Hamlet, how does Shakespeare explore the theme of death?" or "In the War of the Roses, what significant events led to the Battle of Bosworth?"

, Cover up the right side of the page and try to answer the questions, in your own words, without looking at your notes.


You can either do this out loud, reciting the information to yourself, or you can write the information out quickly (using only key words) on a scrap piece of paper.
This part of the exercise is very important, as it will test your memory and help you to identify gaps in your knowledge.
 Uncover the notes and go through them again, checking for any information you might have missed.


Try to reflect on the significance of the information -- why do you need to learn it? How can you apply it to other things? Where does it fit in with the information you already know?
Repeat the covering up and reviewing process as many times as necessary, until you feel comfortable with the material.
 Once you are confident that you have learned the notes well, write a short, concise summary at the bottom of the page.


You can then use this summary for reference every time you review your notes.

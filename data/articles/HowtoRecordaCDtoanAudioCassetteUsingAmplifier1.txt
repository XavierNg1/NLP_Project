 Make sure you have access to the back of the amplifier and other equipment.;
, This works best if you use an amplifier with 2-prong or 3-prong power inputs so that you won't need so many ports in your wall-outlet.



Connect "Audio Out" on the CD/DVD player INTO the "Line IN" on the cassette recorder, using RCA jacks.
If red is present but no white, use the red in the red ports and the other color (sometimes black) in the other port. Connect the same colors on BOTH devices.

 Make sure the edges are straight.;
, Use a marker to draw one vertical line down the middle of the shim. Halfway between the vertical line and the right edge, draw another, parallel line. From the center of the vertical line, draw a horizontal line extending to the left, cutting the shim in half horizontally.
 Then draw two small vertical lines, parallel to the last line you drew, about a centimeter to either side. Use your pinky to get a better idea of the spacing.
 Between the last two lines you drew, draw a slightly less pointed 'V.' This should start at the top corners of the last two lines you drew, and the point of the U should be the bottom of the center vertical line.
 Be careful not to cut into the shim or to hurt yourself on the sharp piece of metal. Cut the shim along the U so that the U forms a protrusion from the center of the shim.
 Its edge should rest along the top of the U.


Fold the legs up. These should be the parts outside and not connected to the U. Fold them up and then wrap them around the folded top half.
, Rub it around the outside of a sharpie or marker to help smooth the shim down and make it more effective as a lock-picking device.


Make sure it's smooth enough to wrapped around the lock you are using it for.

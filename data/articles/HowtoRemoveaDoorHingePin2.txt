 While the most difficult part of taking off a door happens at the end, when it comes to reattaching it, it gets way easier at the start. Due to the fact that keeping an unhinged door stable is tricky work, it's a good idea to keep your hinge pins very close so that as little time will be spent grabbing for them. Putting them in your back pocket will give you an easy time getting them when you need them.


The easiest thing is to have someone holding the pins nearby. They can hand them to you as needed.
 If you remember how many books you needed to fill the door crack before taking the book off, it's recommended you use the same combination again. Otherwise, you may need to do a bit of trial and error before you find an elevation that accommodates the natural crack. Place them at the bottom of the arch for proper support. , Next, you will want to lift up the door and hook it in place with the hinges. This is much more easily done with two people, with one on each side of the door. Locking in the doors will be much easier if you have the books or platform to compensate for the crack underneath it. , Once the door is in relative alignment with the hinges, it's time to get the pins in. Take them out and lightly tap them in until the pin is at least slightly intersecting with the hinge and door. To help alleviate the gravity concerns, you should start with the top pin, then the bottom. If the door you're working with has a middle hinge, leave that one for last.


Once the pins are in part way, give them some tapping with the hammer, gradually increasing the level of force until it's completely in. The pin should be fully seated in the hinge.
 Now that your door is nicely replaced, it's time to give it a finishing touch. A good thing to do is to give it a casual spray with a lubricant like white grease. WD-40 will dry out quickly. This will ensure the hinges are quiet and slick.

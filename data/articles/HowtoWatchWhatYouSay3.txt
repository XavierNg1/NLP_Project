 If you’re in the habit of giving overly critical and unwarranted comments, the problem may be that you personalize events that have little or nothing to do with you.For instance, don’t jump to the conclusion that your friend left the inside of their car a mess to annoy you, or that they canceled plans because they don’t value your time. Take a moment to consider the larger situation before deciding it’s justified for you to be critical.
Similarly, don’t conflate a person’s character with a single action. Your neighbor letting their grass grow too long doesn’t necessarily mean they’re rude or a slob — maybe their lawnmower is broken. And maybe you could offer to lend your mower instead of offering criticism.
 On the surface, there might not seem to be much difference between saying “You don’t listen to me anymore” and “I don’t feel like I’m being heard anymore.” However, using “you” language figuratively points a finger at the other person and puts them on the defensive against criticism. “I” language keeps the focus on your feelings and perceptions.


“Why won’t you ever help me around the house?” sounds and feels more like criticism than “I could really use some help with the housework today.”

, Even if you grew up in an era when different terms were used to refer to various individuals and groups, you shouldn’t expect a pass if you use terms now deemed insensitive, outdated, or offensive. Of course, there’s no single rulebook for “good” and “bad” terms and context plays an important role, so don’t be afraid to politely ask someone about proper terminology or word usage.Accept, though, that you'll still slip up sometimes. Say, for example, you offend someone you assumed was "foreign" by asking “So, where are you from?” or “Wow, you speak great English!” Instead of getting defensive, apologize and work on not repeating the mistake.

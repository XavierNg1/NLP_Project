 Learn that Bunny Hop. Practice it until you can do it easily.;
, You won't need to do Barspins on a ramp at first.


Don't worry about height of your Bunny Hop either. No need to go that high. Has to be high enough to get the spin done in the air, but doesn't need to be way high. Just get it automatic.
Make sure your Bunny Hop is very stable.

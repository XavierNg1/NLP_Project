 This is necessary! Are you not sure if you have one? Go to "Network Connections" in Windows XP or "Network" in Vista. It should say WLAN or something similar.;
, If you go to Starbucks or McDonalds or something like that, they carry free Wi-Fi. Right click your card in Network Connections and click "View Wireless Connections". You should see Starbucks Wi-Fi or safewaywifi, or something similar, depending on your location.
 Click on it and if it requires a WEP or passcode, ask the manager. If it's insecure, just click on it - no worries there.
 If you're not... click "Resolve Issue", "Troubleshoot", or check Network Status and see what is wrong.

 Count to three. 1.....2.....3.... Ok! You may look like your self but you are a monkey inside.;
, That is the trick. At night when no parents are around, jump out of bed, and get down on the floor. Start crawling down the stairs. RACE to your living room. Hide somewhere behind the couch, curled up in a blanket, or squeezed in a tight corner behind an end table.
 You don't want anyone to hear you. Also, stay in the shadows. You don't want to be seen either.
 Steal lots of snacks that look like banana, or are made with banana. Then hurry to a safe place.
 Climb a tree. If you can't, try your best.
 Hide behind the chair, and curl up as much as possible.
 Your enemies are everyone else in your family. But if your sister/brother is doing this, they are NOT your enemy.
 It's OK if you are doing this alone, but more than one monkey is OK too. At least two monkeys can do some things a lone monkey can't do. Like three monkeys can carry food cans. It's difficult being a lone monkey, and that's what makes this fun.
, Sneak the TV remote, and grab a snack. When it is bright enough, go outside. Stand in the middle of the yard. Move five steps right. You are now entering an invisible portal. Take three steps, and you enter the portal.
 You are in a jungle. Take these dangerous quests, and you will succeed. Walk ten steps to the left. You are facing a leopard, invisible. Oh, He's real all right. You will feel the scratches of the leopard. Listen for a roar you can barely hear. Swipe that way. When you can't hear the roar, You've succeeded.
 Listen for thumps. Listen for snorts. Feel the ground shaking. Buffalo have reached you, and they have toppled you.
 Quickly, hop inside your bamboo house. Stay, Recover, Survive. Wait 30 seconds, and then take a nice drink of water. Hop back outside, and climb the highest mountain to the top.
 Carefully, climb to a rock a foot away. 3...2...1..JUMP!!!! You've landed on a nice safe stump. Head inside.

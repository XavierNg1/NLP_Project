 Look at the insect’s waist. Wasps have waists, while bees’ waists are as wide as their bodies. Next check for hair. As noted above, most wasps are hairless, while bees tend to be more hairy to help them carry pollen. Finally, look at the insect’s length -- wasps tend to be longer than most bees., Generally, you’ll see the same basic colors on wasps and bees. Note, however, that wasps have more distinct colors and patterns than bees. Look for especially vivid coloring on wasps, in contrast to the more muted colors on bees., Wasps tend to eat other insects. Yellowjackets are scavengers and you can observe them eating or hunting for human food and garbage. Bees, on the other hand, survive on pollen and nectar.

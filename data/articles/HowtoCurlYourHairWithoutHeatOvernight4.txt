 Check out this article for instructions on "plopping." All you need is a towel and a T-shirt for overnight curls.
 Wrap small sections of hair around each roller to make a tight curl. Leave in overnight and remove in the morning.
 Section your hair into four to eight sections, depending on its thickness. Lay a thin dress sock over the end of a section, and slowly wrap the hair around it. When all of the hair is wrapped around it, tie the sock into a knot. Repeat for remaining sections and leave in overnight.


Do this with slightly damp hair for best results.

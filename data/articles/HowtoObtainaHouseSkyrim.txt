, Solitude is the best if you want a big house.
 Besides mods, this is the only way to obtain a house.
 For example, Solitude's Jarl's quests are:


The Man Who Cried Wolf, where you must interrupt the necromancer's ritual of summoning Potema Septim.
Elisif's Tribute, where you must venture to a specific Shrine Of Talos, and place an item called 'Torygg's War Horn'.
 You then become a Thane of the hold, the Jarl allowing you to buy property. (In this case, a house.)

, You can now begin setting it up as you please.

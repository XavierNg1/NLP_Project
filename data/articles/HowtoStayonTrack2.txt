 Whatever your goal is, you can’t expect life to work around it. Whether you’re trying to save money, start a new career, or lose weight, you need to make your goal a top priority by carving out time for it every day. If your goal is a standing commitment in your schedule, you are more likely to stay on track.For instance, if you are trying to lose weight, you might include a 30-minute window for exercise in your daily calendar.
 A natural source of accountability for goal-completion is your social circle. Setting a personal intention only goes so far. In addition, tell someone in your network about your intentions. Friends and family can remind you to stick with your goals. They may also offer encouragement when times get tough., If you don’t have measures in place to control distractions, your goals are at the mercy of your environment. Social media, unexpected phone calls and visits, and smartphone notifications compete for your attention, and usually win.


Work in an environment that supports productivity. Reduce clutter around your desk. Install applications that require that you complete a certain amount of work before using non-goal-oriented websites. Put your phone on silent. Hang up a “do not disturb” sign.

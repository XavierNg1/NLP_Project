 If you are close to a clinical or hospital, you may want to have a doctor remove the tick using an intradermal blister. This procedure is great for cleanly removing a tick without pulling it from the skin and risking stomach regurgitation.The procedure is relatively quick and painless. However, it does involve needles, so it may not be perfect for those with needle phobias.
 This is a medication used to numb tissue in a specific area. A Lidocaine filled blister will slowly begin to develop under the tick.


Lidocaine is also referred to as Xylocaine.
 Because the tick will find the Lidocaine unappealing, it will release its grip and remove itself from the bite on its own. Because it was not pulled from the wound, the tick will not have released its stomach contents into your body.Be sure to grab the tick before it runs off and finds a tastier spot on your body or attaches to someone else.
Once the tick is gone, you can squeeze the Lidocaine out of the blister or let your body break it down on its own.

 In a medium sized bowl, add 2 parts red washable tempera paint to one part water. Then pour in a dash of blue, about one teaspoon (4.93 ml) per cup (236.59 ml) of red paint you are using. Stir with a paintbrush or a spoon until the colors and water are mixed.Washable tempura paint isn’t edible, but it also won’t stain your clothes.
Adding a touch of blue gives fake blood a darker and more realistic color.
Stir the tempura paint instead of shaking. Because of the chemical composition of the paint, shaking can cause it to foam.
 Glue dyed with red ink makes thick and sticky fake blood. Add your desired amount of liquid school glue to a disposable bowl, using as much glue as you want blood. Add in red ink, which you can purchase from art and hobby stores, until you are satisfied with the intensity of the color. If you want a darker blood color, add brown ink or chocolate syrup.You can also remove the ink tube from a red pen, cut it with a serrated knife, and pour the red ink into the glue.
Aim to use about 3 parts glue and 2 parts ink.
To make the fake blood less bright and more realistic, add in cocoa powder a teaspoon (14.79 ml) at a time. Cocoa powder darkens the fake blood to make it more of a burgundy color than a bright red.
Corn syrup and cocoa powder creates a thicker blood than using just paint and water.
 You can also make fake blood by mixing red paint with maple syrup and water. In a disposable cup or bowl, mix equal parts red poster or acrylic paint with maple syrup. Then add in a touch of blue, about one teaspoon (4.93 ml) per ½ cup (118.3 ml) of paint. Add water gradually by the teaspoon, stirring until you reach the consistency that you want.If you want very thick paint blood, you don’t have to add water.

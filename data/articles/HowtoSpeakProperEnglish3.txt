 Reading is a great way to expand your vocabulary while also understanding the correct context of words.


Use a dictionary while reading so you can look up any words you don't understand.
Read material that you find interesting, whether it's fictional novels, the newspaper, a history book or a magazine.
 When writing or speaking, instead of using small describing words such as; "the building over there is big", use more eloquent words that mean basically the same thing, but convey more meaning. For example: "the building over there is gigantic.".


Alternatively, you can make the sentence more complex. For example, "the building over there is said to be one of the largest in Europe."

, If you're a non-native English speaker, it can be difficult to remember even basic words. A good way around this is to make labels for everyday household items which contain the English word and its pronunciation.


Stick these labels on the items and you will be reminded of the word every time you see or use each object.
Leave the labels on until you have committed the word to memory.

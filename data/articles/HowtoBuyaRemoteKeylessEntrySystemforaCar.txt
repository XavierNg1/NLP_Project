 These are safer, but not as convenient as systems that open all car doors at once.
Multiple door remote keyless systems unlock all car doors and your car's trunk. Some key chain controllers for these systems can be set to open certain doors when specific buttons are pressed, giving you more control and entry options for passengers.;

Basic entry systems function to only lock and unlock the doors and signal an alarm for unauthorized entry.






Pager model entry systems are equipped to transmit information about whether the hood or trunk has been opened, interior temperature and battery voltage and often include panic button and car locator features.
, This will increase car security, but also the cost of the system and installation.



Consider how close you will need to be in order for the system to work. Less expensive systems will have shorter ranges, which could be suitable for drivers that park close to home. Longer range systems give you more freedom, but will be more expensive and drain your car's battery faster.



Choose a remote entry system with a quality warranty option. A warranty for a remote entry system should last as long as you expect to own your car, since the system will be a permanent fixture in the vehicle.



You will need more than one key chain controller for the remote entry system if the car in which it's being installed is driven by more than one person. Choose a system that provides extra controllers at no extra charge.
Store an extra controller in the same safe place you store an extra car key in case the controller on your key chain is lost or stolen.



Professionals with knowledge of the entry system you buy will be able to accurately install the system for a small fee, ensuring that it will work properly.

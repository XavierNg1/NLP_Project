Okay, so it IS cheating a little bit. But it gets the job done and that is what is really important. It takes YOU about five minutes. Of course it takes the restore longer but "you" don't have to really do anything. Just be sure to restore the computer to a date BEFORE the computer started asking you for the Administrator Password. Once it has restored your computer and you can get on it again like before, THEN you can go to the Administrator Information, find out the password and keep it in a safe place. You should also make a second Administrator Information account that has no password at all so that if it happens again and you can't find your password for some reason, you can log in on the second Administrator account (it has no password) to get onto your computer.

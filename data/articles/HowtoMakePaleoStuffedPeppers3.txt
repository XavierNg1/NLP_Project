 Pour 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil into a large skillet. Turn the heat on to medium and once the oil shimmers, stir in ½ cup (75 g) of chopped onion, 4 cloves of minced garlic, and 1 seeded and chopped medium jalapeño or serrano chile. Cook the aromatics for about 2 minutes.Stir the onion, garlic, and chili frequently since they will stick to the pan easily.
 Stir in 2 pounds (907 g) of ground chicken or turkey and cook the meat until it's not pink in the center. The temperature should reach 165 degrees F (73 C). Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of Mexican seasoning over the meat and onion mixture. Stir the filling mixture so the seasoning is incorporated., Open 1 14.5-ounce can of no-salt-added fire-roasted diced tomatoes and stir it into the skillet. Don't drain the tomatoes before you add them. Bring the mixture to a boil and turn the heat down. Let the filling bubble lightly for 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro.Keep the filling mixture uncovered while it cooks. This will help most of the liquid evaporate and will concentrate the flavor.
 Wash 4 medium red, yellow or orange sweet bell peppers. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut away the stems. Remove the seeds. You may need to rinse them to completely get them out of the peppers. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the bell peppers. Boil them for 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully lift them out of the water using a slotted spoon.The peppers should be a little tender. Boiling the peppers means that you won't need to bake the stuffed peppers.
 Use a spoon to fill each of the cooked peppers with the Mexican chicken mixture. To serve them, place two filled peppers on a plate and garnish them with:Chopped cilantro
Lime wedges
Cauliflower rice

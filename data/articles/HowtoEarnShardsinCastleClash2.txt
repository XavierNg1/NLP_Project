 Tap the blue portal thats on the bottom of the raid button.
 Try the Normal Dungeons for practice. You can get 1-4 shards in there. It's much harder to get shards though. Normal Dungeons 2 is harder, but gives more shards. If you have level 60-80 heroes, the first 9 expert dungeons will be better. Unlock an expert dungeon and complete a few. They give 6-14 shards, and they are much easier to earn since hey have lower heroes, and not many.
 Each level will give a certain amount of shards, depending on the difficulty of the level.
 In Normal Dungeons 2, there are heroes that past level 60, so try to get your heroes higher than that so you can kill those heroes. Expert Dungeons 1 are easier from levels 1-9. However, starting in number 10, there is boss that is more difficult to kill. If you are able to beat the dungeon without any of your heroes dying or losing too much HP, you will gain 14 shards.


The dungeons will get harder as you go however, especially in Expert dungeons. Normal Dungeon levels will soon have many heroes that are harder to kill, so it may not be possible to earn a lot of shards from them, unless you are doing dungeon levels for Normal 1, levels 1-16, you may be able to earn at least 3 shards from most of those dungeons. Levels 1-9 in Expert give shards easily. If you do a lot of those dungeons in a few days, you may earn hundreds very easily.
 They die easily, so if they do, you may not get the shards. You may only use them in extremely easy dungeons, which only give one shard usually. You can however, kill all heroes and defenses before deploying them so they don't die, but heroes are much more better.
 Usually, dungeons with a blue tower of a castle on them are more complicated, but they reward more shards. Just like in the Expert dungeons, if there is a boss, it will usually have a blue tower, and it will reward more shards if none of your heroes die or lose large amounts of HP.

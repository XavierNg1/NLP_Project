 Open a new Internet browser window or tab, and type in the URL of the article’s website in the address bar. Hit the Enter key of your keyboard to be directed to the website.
 Once in the website, navigate it until you find the article you want to share. Scroll down the article’s page and you will see a series of social media buttons that can be used to share the article on that particular social media account. Sometimes they are on the side or on the top of the page.
 The button should look typically like the Facebook logo (blue with white “F”) and have the word “Share” next to or under it.
 Do this just like you would any account; enter your registered email address and password into the fields provided, and click “Log in.”

, Wait for the page to load after logging in, and you will see the article that you want to share, along with a text box above it. Click inside the text box and type anything you want to say regarding the article.
 This will post the article to your timeline, or wall, where you can view it again once you log into your Facebook account on the Facebook website or app.

 You should end up with one loop on your hook and the working end of your yarn sticking out across the last stitch.






;
, Begin this by looping the working end of your yarn around your hook. Rotate your hook slightly, so the yarn stays on it, and then pull the loop of yarn back through the loop that was already on your hook. You should now have one new loop on your hook.
 You can do this by pulling the extra yarn from the working end of your project.
 Pull out the loose end of the yarn (your working end), leaving one piece of yarn sticking out of the end of your project. This piece should be at least a couple inches long.
, If you are having a hard time doing this, simply bend the middle of the yarn in half and squeeze it tight. Push the bent area through the eye of the needle.
 Using the needle, pull the yarn back through the middle of the last three stitches you made. Pull the end of the yarn out, so that the needle and yarn are sticking out in the middle of the row, and then stick the needle back into the project. Head back in the other direction with your needle and yarn, inserting the needle one row down and pushing it through the middle of about three stitches. This should lock your yarn tail in place.
 The yarn should stay in place, hidden in the middle of several rows of your stitches.
 Make sure that the end of the yarn is still tucked away neatly and that the tension on the row is that same as the rest of your project. Your project is now finished!

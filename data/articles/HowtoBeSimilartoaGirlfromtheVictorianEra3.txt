Ladies, remember, their clothing covered their WHOLE body. Even the glimpse of an ankle is a stereotype "no-no."

, Instead of coats, women wore shawls or cloaks when cold.
 This one is very emphasized. As young as 4 years old girls must cover their knee and sixteen year old girls must cover their ankles. If you are in that age range, you have free to customize your skirts within that range.
 One exception to full body coverings. Ball gowns or formal attire. You may show your shoulders and/or breast line.
 Corsets can have the power to crush your internal organs and lower sets of ribs, so as far a recommending them, most would not. Bustles were designed to hold the skirt up and a very modernized and simple way to make one is to tie a pillow with a belt under your skirt.
 Especially with lace, these gloves are a great way to show you love Victorian times. It really doesn't matter if its white or black, but black is the most Victorian-looking.
 Brooches are very Victorian. While people from Victorian time mostly wore ones containing plain silver or pearls, emerald is accepted, too.
 Hats make the look. If you find a very nice looking antique hat, buy it. You can wear it! It makes the look.

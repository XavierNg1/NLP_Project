 Showing up to class is half the battle, so listen and pay attention to the material. Seeing your teacher break down a problem on the board is key, since math is typically more visual than other subjects due to the equations and problem solving.Jot down any example problems from the session/class. When you review your notes later on, you will have a better feel for the specific lesson that was taught, rather than relying on your textbook.
 The teacher might not tell you specifically what is going to be on the exam, but they might give you helpful guidance if you don't understand. Asking questions about material that confuses you will also show the teacher you care about doing well in the class.Each night after school, look over your notes. Highlight any questions you have and take them to your teacher for further explanation.
 Make sure you read all of the assigned text and not just the examples. Textbooks often include proofs of the formulas that will help you understand the lesson much more thoroughly. Further, if you do the assigned reading, you'll be better prepared for each class, so you'll be able to actively participate.Actively participating, or raising your hand to respond to and ask questions, will help your grade in the long run.

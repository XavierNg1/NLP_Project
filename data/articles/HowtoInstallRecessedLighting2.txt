 Use a drywall saw to carefully cut around each outline you drew on the ceiling. Avoid cutting too much away; you can always cut more later, but it is much harder to remedy too large a cut.


Cover your floor with a painter's canvas and hold a disposal bag underneath the ceiling; any drywall, sheetrock, or insulation that falls down while you're cutting should make it right into your bag.
 If the attic is above the ceiling, it is best to install mounts that are secured to the joists themselves, as they are very secure. If the area above the ceiling is finished, you can use mounting hardware that fits through the hole you cut and mounts to the drywall itself.
 Doing this now will save you more time later. Leave about 18 inches (45 cm) of wire hanging down through each hole; this will ensure that you have enough slack to wire each light.


If the attic is above the ceiling, you can easily run the wire through the attic. If a finished area is above the ceiling, you can use a long, flexible drill bit to drill the necessary holes in the ceiling joists, and then fish the wires through the joists.
, If you're using connectors to hook your wires into the fixture, simply snap in the connectors into the housing. Feed one set of wires from the junction box, and any additional wires to the next light in the chain (if you want to work with a single switch) and tighten off at the housing.
 Lock off the wires into the wire connectors push lock system, organizing the same colors together into one push lock. Put the wires and connectors back into the fixture box. Do this same process for each recessed light you want to install.

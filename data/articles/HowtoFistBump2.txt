This looks cool and can be something special that you share with a specific friend., If you have a really good friend and you always fist bump, try bumping your hips together after you fist bump to solidify your bond. Line up side to side and bump your hips together after the fist bump if you're both really excited about something., After touching knuckles, open up your hand, pull it back, and wiggle your fingers. If you both do this, it will look like an explosion.

 Write a list of what you would like to buy and the price range you expect to pay, it may sound stupid but it will save you from buying those non-useful items. It is also a good idea of writing down or ticking off what you have wrote with the price you spent. That way, you can look at it in the future and tell yourself to spend a little lower or look at cheaper stores.;
, Check out what's on sale and what the price is. If you like it, find out more about it because it could cost a fair amount of money and it just doesn't last long. When looking at catalogues first, you're not tempted to buy it right away and you have time to think about the pros and cons of the item.
 Sometimes online shopping can be really cheap, if you think a price can't get better then it is, buy the item.
 Visit a fairly cheap but good quality store. When things are on sale you can find great clothes for 5 dollars! The good thing about these two stores is that there are changing rooms so you can try everything on.

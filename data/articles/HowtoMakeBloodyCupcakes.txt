 Preheat the oven to 350 °F (177 °C). Place cupcake liners in each case of a cupcake tray.;
, Do this with a hand mixer or electric mixer until the mixture is light and fluffy.
 Mix again until the mixture is creamy and resembles a red color.
 In a separate bowl, whisk the the flour, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and salt. Pour it in the creamed mixture and blend on low speed until the dry ingredients are folded in. The batter will be dry and slightly crumbly. This is normal.
 Blend on low speed. The cupcake batter should start to form and resemble a vibrant red color. Blend until there are no more flour streaks.
,,, Cream the butter and cream cheese on high speed using a hand mixer or electric mixer. Do so until fluffy. Slowly stir in the powdered sugar and blend on low speed. Pour in the vanilla and cinnamon and mix until well-combined. Place the frosting into a frosting pipe.
, Heat the sugar and water in a large pot, until it starts to boil and the sugar dissolves. Add the corn syrup and cream of tartar. Stir slowly with a wooden spoon and have it continue to cook for about 15-20 minutes, until the mixture slightly thickens.


The mixture should be a clear color, not brown. If the mixture starts to brown, that means it's getting too hot.
 Have it harden for about 10 minutes.
 Remove the cracked pieces from the tray and carefully place them in a small bowl.
 Mix ten drops of red food coloring gel and two drops of blue food coloring to give the "blood" a more realistic look. Stir in the corn syrup and mix until well-combined.
 Using a small spoon, drizzle the "blood" all over each cupcake. Poke two of cracked sugar candy pieces into each cupcake. Add more "blood" if desired.
 Place a cupcake on a serving plate. Enjoy!

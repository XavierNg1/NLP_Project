 Ribbon is an easy way to embellish your headband. You can use ribbon to accent one part of your headband or thread ribbon through the entire headband. Choose a ribbon that complements your yarn color and attach or thread it through the headband where you want it.


You can even use the ribbon to hide your seam if you created a strip headband and sewed the ends together. Loop the ribbon around the seam a few times and tie it in a knot or bow.
 Adding a decorative button is a cute way to embellish a headband. You can even use a button to attach the ends of a headband if you have used a stitch with some gaps in it.Sew the button onto the headband with a needle and thread., Choose a yarn or silk flower color that complements your headband and attach it with a needle and thread or just use a safety pin to secure it temporarily.
 If you want to give your headband a bow-like appearance without actually adding a bow, then you can use a chain of stitches to create this effect.Make a chain of about 10 to 15 stitches.
Then, loop the chain around one part of the headband a few times. Make sure to wrap the chain around the headband tightly.
Use a slipstitch to secure both ends of the chain.
Pull the free end of the yarn through, cut the end, and tie off the end.

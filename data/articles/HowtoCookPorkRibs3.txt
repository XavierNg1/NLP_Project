 You can use store-bought sauce or make your own. You'll add it in the final stages of cooking the ribs, but you can start making it while they're still in the oven. If you want to make your own, follow these steps:









Saut√© 1/4 cup diced onion in a saucepan with a little oil.
Add 1/2 cup ketchup, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar, 1 tablespoon hot sauce, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and salt and pepper.
Simmer the mixture for 15 minutes to 1/2 hour, stirring occasionally.
 To give the ribs a crispy exterior, it's necessary to finish them without the foil.
 The method you use to finish your ribs is up to you. Both the broiler and grill methods will result in tender, crispy ribs that fall apart when you bite into them.
 You can pour it directly over them in the pan.
 If you're broiling them, just put the pan back in the oven, uncovered. To grill them, place the rack on the grill and cook it until crispy on both sides., Give your guests a few ribs each and serve them with extra barbecue sauce, if desired.

 If using fabric, cut or tear into a long strip.
 Twist the fabric strip at the length desired, facing the fabric the right side up.
 Hold this twist between your thumb and index finger. Make another loop but this time, in the opposite direction (keep it the same size). Twist the loop toward you.
 The amount of loops you make depends on how full you want the loop to be and on how much fabric strip you've allowed for the project.
 Measure a length for the second tail (which holds the bow together and serves to attach it to the gift). Cut out a narrow strip of fabric or ribbon to this length. Wrap this around the center of the loops (where they all meet as twists). Tie both tail ends together at what is going to be the back of the bow.


Leave the narrow tails alone, as they will be used for attaching the bow and should not be shortened.
 Trim the ends of the fat tails diagonally to neaten.
 Use the narrow tails to tie or tape onto the gift.

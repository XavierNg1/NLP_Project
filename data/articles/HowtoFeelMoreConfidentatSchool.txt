 Stand tall and sit up straight. This body language tells people that you are interested, confident and not a pushover either!;
, Not many people would want to know someone who is constantly moody, grumpy, and unkind to others, let alone hang out with them. Smile, chat with others, organize hanging out with your fellow schoolmates.
 Don't be afraid to talk to someone new, no matter how they appear. You never know, your new best friend may be right next to you.
 By making new friends, your confidence can skyrocket and so will your overall happiness.
 Being different is the best bit about you and something worth celebrating! Your friends may all love one band while you love another. This doesn't mean you need to change your interests or preferences. You are who you are, and nothing can change that.
 Everyone makes mistakes so don't worry! Learn from them and move on; there's no reason to dwell on things of the past that you can't change.
 Don't get angry, simply calmly tell someone who is making you feel upset that the way they are treating you is unacceptable. If they carry on don't be afraid to tell someone whether it be a teacher, parent, or trusted adult.
 Talk to someone you trust who can give you the right advice and make you feel less anxious.
 Don't be tempted by peer pressure to try something like graffiti or smoking. It will only get you into trouble and if you're pressurized to do it, you know that this person is not a 'real' friend, no matter how much you like them. It's not easy to say no, but it will pay off in the long run.
 Whenever you feel bad about how you look or how people make you feel, just look at the list and perhaps it will cheer you up! Everyone is good at something, whether it's writing or being a friendly person.
 If you don't wash regularly or use deodorant, people may not want to speak to you or befriend you. This can diminish self confidence.

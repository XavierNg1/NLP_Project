 There are many different decanters, at various prices. The important thing to remember is that the purpose of decanting a wine is to expose as much of the wine as possible to oxygen. The wider the decanter, the better. Some decanters are also created at a 45 degree angle or so. This exposes even more of the wine's surface area to air.;
, There are two philosophies on the intensity of the pour. Some people believe a vigorous, quick pour better aerates the wine, some believe this can shock the wine and prefer a slower, more gentle pour. Especially with older wines, an easy, gentle pour is the way to go.
 How long depends on what kind of wine you have. A tannic, robust red like Cabernet Sauvignon, French Cahors or Australian Shiraz can be left for a few hours, settling the wine and opening up the fruit flavours. More delicate reds like Pinot Noir and Amarone need less time.

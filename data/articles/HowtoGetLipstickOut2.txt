 If you’ve gotten lipstick on your clothes, you need to check the label to determine the fabric. A lot of clothes require special treatment, such as dry cleaning, so you may need to take it directly to a professional. If there are no special treatment directions, go ahead and take out the lipstick stain at home.
 Make sure that whatever you choose to use is something you can throw out. This will absorb the colored lipstick from your clothing.
 Place the clothing stain side down over your paper towel. Before you start working—remember that the key to removing the stain is to work gently from the outer edge of the stain inward.
 Dawn, or any other mild soap that’s formulated to fight grease will work. Put the soap on a paper towel or cloth if you’d like. Once you’ve covered the spot with dish soap, let it sit for 10 minutes.
 Once you’ve let the dish soap sit for 10 minutes, use a paper towel to apply pressure on the stain. You can scrub it, but be gentle enough not to damage your clothes. This will force the soap and the stain into the paper towel beneath it. Replace the paper towel underneath the stain as needed. If you leave it for too long, your stain will spread rather than disappear.
 Once you’ve removed the stain, rinse the fabric with water. Wash it as you normally would and check to make sure the stain is gone. If the stain isn't gone, repeat the dish soap process. Once the stain is gone, your garment will be safe to dry.

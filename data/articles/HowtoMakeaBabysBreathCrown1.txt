 Using a thin floral wire, measure the circumference of your head. Wrap the wire around the top of your head where you would like to crown to sit. Then double the amount of wire and cut it using pliers. You want to double the wire in order to ensure that you have a sturdy base for the crown. This will also allow you to make an adjustable crown.Floral wire can be purchased at your local florist or craft supply store.;
, Once you have cut the wire, find the middle of the wire and fold it in half. Place your index finger at the fold and then begin to tightly twist the wire so that it twists all the way to the ends. You can trim the end of the wire to create a clean end with two equal lengths.
 After you have twisted the wire, you will have a loop at one end where your index finger was located. Fold the other end to create a hook. You can adjust the circumference by creating a larger or smaller hook. This works nicely if you are making a crown that will be worn by someone else.Place the hook through the loop to hold the wire in the shape of a crown.
 Using floral tape, wrap the wire tightly with tape. This will help to hide wire and will give your homemade baby’s breath crown a more professional and finished look. Add extra tape to the end of the wire. This will help to prevent the wire from poking your while wearing it.You can use a green floral tape to blend in with the stems of the baby’s breath.
If the crown is being used in a wedding, you may want to match the tape with the wedding colours. For example, try gold or silver floral tape.

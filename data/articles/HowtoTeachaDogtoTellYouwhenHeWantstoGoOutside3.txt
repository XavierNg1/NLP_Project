 Before you can train your dog to bark when he wants to go outside, you will need to teach him to bark on command or "speak." This is a relatively easy trick to teach your dog, although you may want to avoid if your dog already barks a lot.To start, get your dog excited by waving a favorite toy around, making a noise, or doing anything else to get him to bark.
When he barks, reward him with a treat. Try to only reward a single bark, as you do not want to encourage him to keep barking.
Once you are able to get your dog to bark consistently with this method, add a hand signal or verbal command and use it consistently until the dog learns to bark when this command is given.
Continue to practice and reinforce the behavior by giving your dog a treat when he speaks on command.
Do not reward the dog for barking unless you specifically ask him to do it.
 Once your dog is able to speak on command, you can move on to teaching him to bark as a signal to go outside. Start by going to the door and asking your dog to speak. When he does, immediately let him out.As with the other training methods, if going outside is not enough of a reward for your dog, reward him with a treat as you let him out.
 The more consistent you are with this training, the faster your dog will learn. Have him bark each and every time you go outside, and before long, he will learn that he can ask you to go outside by repeating that behavior.

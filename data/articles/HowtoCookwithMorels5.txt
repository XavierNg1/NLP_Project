 For the soup, you’ll need 1 pound (454 g) of fresh morel mushrooms. Place them in a large bowl, and drizzle 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of lemon juice over them.Make sure that the morels are rinsed and clean before you begin cooking.
 Add 3 tablespoons (42 g) of butter to a large saucepan. Heat it over medium-high heat until the butter melts, which should take approximately 5 minutes.You can substitute olive oil for the butter if you prefer.
 Once the butter has melted, add the morels and a large, chopped onion to the pan. Allow the mixture to cook until the morels and onion become tender, which should take 5 to 6 minutes.Be sure to stir the mixture occasionally as you saute it to ensure that it cooks evenly.
 When the mushrooms and onion are tender, sprinkle 2 tablespoons (16 g) of all-purpose flour over the mixture. Stir well to thoroughly blend in the flour., Once the flour is mixed in, add 4 cups (946 ml) of milk, 3 teaspoons (8 g) of chicken bouillon granules, ½ teaspoon (½ g) of dried thyme, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt, and ⅛ teaspoon (¼ g) of black pepper. Stir well to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully combined.Whole milk will create the creamiest soup, but you can use 2% milk if you prefer.
If you like, you can also mix some dried sage into the soup.
 When all of the ingredients are combined, raise the heat to high. Bring the mixture to a boil, and then allow it to cook for 2 minutes.Be sure to stir the soup the entire time that it’s boiling.
 After you’ve boiled the soup for a couple of minutes, lower the heat to medium. Let the soup simmer for 10 to 15 minutes to allow the flavors to deepen., When the soup is finished simmering, ladle it into individual bowls. Serve it while it’s still hot.The soup pairs well with crusty bread or garlic croutons.

, Do what the coach tells you; they know what they're doing. Even when you feel like your legs are about to fall off from all the conditioning, keep doing it. It will pay off in the long run and after all of the pain it will get easier and easier.
 Practice at your house by bumping, serving, setting, and hitting on your wall. You can randomly do your approach and jump as high as possible to practice blocking. And give your best effort at practice; put your all in it.

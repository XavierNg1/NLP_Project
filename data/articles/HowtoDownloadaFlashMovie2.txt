 Firefox is the most popular browser for adding extensions, and it can be downloaded for free from the Mozilla website. One of the highest-rated download extensions is the free DownloadHelper.


DownloadHelper will automatically detect media files in your browser page and give you the option to download them.
 Once the video begins playing, the DownloadHelper icon will start animating in the top-right corner of your Firefox window and a small arrow will appear next to it. Click the arrow to open a choice of download options.
 When you click the arrow, you will be provided several different formats to download. MP4 is playable on most devices and computers, while FLV has more limited support.


You will be given several quality options as well. Higher quality videos (1080p, 720p) will take more hard disk space than lower quality (480p, 360p), so decide which is more important to you.
 Once you have selected your format and quality, the download will begin. You can check the progress in the Downloads window in Firefox. This window can be accessed by clicking the Firefox menu and clicking Downloads.

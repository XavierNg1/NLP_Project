 It is important to bring your Javanese cat to the vet for regular checkups (at least once a year), or in the event that you suspect it may be ill or injured. Your vet can advise you about your catâ€™s diet, exercise routine, and overall health, and test for diseases. As a breed, Javanese cats are genetically prone to conditions such as:Asthma
Lymphoma
Gastrointestinal conditions
Congenital heart defects
Progressive retinal atrophy;
, To keep your Javanese cat healthy, feed it good quality food and measure and control its portions to prevent weight gain. Buy cat food with few to no preservatives or fillers (e.g. corn, soy) and a high percentage of protein. A healthy, active cat like the Javanese requires about 30 calories for each pound it weighs, each day.For instance, an 8 pound cat would require 240 calories per day. This works out to about one 6 oz. can of cat food per day, or 4/5 cup of dry food.
Treats should make up no more than 10% of your cat's daily diet., Javanese cats are very energetic cats who run the risk of feline obesity if they do not get enough exercise. Play games with your cat to keep it entertained and healthy. Purchase cat toys for your cat to bat around and chase on its own (e.g puzzle toys or toy mice), or make cat toys yourself, such as:String toys
Cat fishing rods
Foil balls (with catnip, if desired)
Feather toys

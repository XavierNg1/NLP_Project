 Take care to choose a book of a decent size; if it's too small, you might run out of space but if it's too large, it might be hard to hold. Think about how you will use it before selecting the book. While any style of notebook might work for you, you can also find books made specially to be a Book of Shadows in occult or magic stores. Some considerations to help your decision include:


The binding: Do you want it to be covered in fabric or spiral bound?
Lined or unlined: While lined makes it easy to write on, unlined gives you greater freedom when writing or drawing and making diagrams.
Recycled: It is nice to consider the environment and choose a book that has minimal impact, in line with your nature-based beliefs.
Cover: If you wish to decorate it, a blank cover is easiest, although you can always cover any printed design with blank paper first, then create your own design over the top.;
, There are various options for decorating the book, either by painting or drawing, sticking on symbols or printed and covering them with contact paper or using an existing Book of Shadows image and gluing it in place. When designing the decorations for your cover, the following ideas might be of help in inspiring you:


Triple moon goddess
Pentagram
Infinity sign
Your astrological symbol
Planetary symbols
A cross (If it goes with your religion)
Clavicula Nox
Or anything else you think would be appropriate.
 While you don't have to divide the Book, you can do so if wished. Use dividers and tape them in place. Divide your book into four sections:


Spells
Astral projection journal (such as a dream journal)
Dream journal
Cheat sheets (references for incense, herbs, moon phases, etc.)

, For example, if your four main dividers are on top, use dividers on the side. Divide the spells into six mini sections, as follows:

Love spells
Health spells
Spiritual spells
Wealth spells
Beauty spells
Luck spells.
 It's now created, so it's now up to you how you use it.

 Getting to know new people is the best way to fit in at a university as large as Penn State. Having a large circle of friends makes the campus seem just a little bit smaller. Getting to know the people in your dorm is a great way to find people to walk to class with, have dinner with, or just hang out with.;
, The more activities you are involved in, the more people you will know (or at least the more faces you will recognize). It’s not necessarily important to remember everyone’s name, but it is nice and comforting to be able to wave to a familiar face when walking to class. By getting involved you are also making a small difference here at Penn State, which can give you a great sense of accomplishment.
 Getting behind on your work is one of the worst things to do. It only leads to putting it off even more, and then it takes longer to get caught up. Whether you are doing the work as soon as class is over, or right before it begins, get it done. No one likes the feeling of walking into an exam, completely unprepared, knowing that you have no chance of passing.
 Worrying about work can lead to nothing good. Do the work you need to do to get the grades you want to get, but don’t stress out over it. Studying for too long seems to make the test seem harder. Be prepared, but don’t waste your life away at Penn State by being locked up in your room studying all the time.
 Going out is by far the best way to meet new people. It’s nice to be able to go to a place you have never been before, grab a beer, and hit the dance floor. If you look like you’re enjoying yourself, it’s easier for other people to approach you. By going out more, people will start to recognize you, and you will definitely enjoy yourself more.
 I’m not saying get wasted, but loosen up a little bit. Even if that may take a little liquor, make sure you are having fun. Take advantage of the free drinks while you can get them, because they are not going to last for long. Get to know the bartender; if you remember his name, he’s a lot more likely to give you a drink.
 No one likes the kid at the party who is puking over the balcony or in the bathroom. You don’t want to have to be someone else’s responsibility. Know your limits, and definitely respect them. You also don’t want to be meeting up with any police on your long walk home, where ever that may be.
 Friends are important; you watch out for them, and they watch out for you. Don’t let them make stupid decisions they are going to regret in the morning after they have sobered up a little bit. I am sure you would want them to do the same for you.
 Not only is the pizza amazing, but the people are too. Meeting people in line is another great way to enjoy your night. The pizza is great, but the experience of waiting in line is unforgettable. Plus, it’s only a dollar a slice.
 You only attend Penn State once, so you might as well live it up while you are here. As the saying goes, “You have four years to be irresponsible here. Relax. Work is for people with jobs. You'll never remember class time, but you'll remember the time you wasted hanging out with your friends. So, stay out late. Go out on a Tuesday with your friends when you have a paper due Wednesday. Spend money you don't have. Drink till sunrise. The work never ends but college does.�?

 There are lots of different types of Blackberries. There are also different colours: Pink, lavender, black and silver. Many people prefer the Bold to the Curve but it's up to you. (Personally I prefer the Curve);
, Rhinestone covers are the best though the rhinestones fall off after some time. You can get a rubber cover but they aren't very BBB!

, Most Blackberry Babes are celebrities. This doesn't mean that you should copy the hairstyle of a celebrity, just make sure your hair is always neat and tidy. Bobs and long hair and cute.
 Or as perfect as you can get! Drink 8-10 glasses of water or half your body weight in water if you are over 16 and drink two water bottles if you are under. Wash your face twice a day and exfoliate once a week.
 Find out what your body type is and read articles that tell you what suits your body. Buy lots of magazines like Vogue (and Teen Vogue), Cosmopolitan (and Cosmo girl), Elle and Seventeen. Research Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn but mix that style in with modern celebrities of today.
 A little bit of lip gloss, mascara and eyeliner.
 Walk with confidence-shoulders back and look forward.
 A Blackberry babe CANNOT have yellow teeth. Use a whitening toothpaste, mouthwash and floss.
 Bath/shower twice a day every day. Use deodorant. Wash your hair every other day or once a week.
 Right now Paul's Boutique's bag are really in! Carry it around like a model not on your shoulder (unless it's a shoulder bag).
 Get an Ipad, Nintendo 3DS and things like that.
 Wear them a lot and make sure they're designer. Rhinestones are awesome on sunglasses.

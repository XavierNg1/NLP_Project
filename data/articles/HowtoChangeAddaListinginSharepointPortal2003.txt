 Be aware that there is one for each template. You can find these files at:


Local_Drive:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\60\TEMPLATE\Locale ID\;
, This approach removes the Server control responsible for rendering the Check box from the page.
Search upload.aspx for the following string: <SPSWC:SubmitLinkOnSTSUploadDocPage runat=server />
Delete it.
Save and exit notepad.


Option 2

Set the default check box to unchecked/false. This approach involves adding some javascript that flips the value client side when the page loads.
Find the following tags at the bottom of Upload.aspx:</BODY>
</HTML>

Insert this code snippet above them:<script language='javascript' for='window' event='onload'>
document.all.submitlst.checked=false;
</script>

Save and exit notepad.

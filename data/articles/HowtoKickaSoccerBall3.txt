 To hook the ball, hit it on the inside of your foot, but slightly turn your foot forward as you kick the ball. Your foot should be at a 45 degree angle when you follow through.
 To slice the ball, hit it on the outside of your foot, with your foot trailing away from the ball as you strike it. This time, your foot should be at a 45 degree angle facing the other way (compared to a hook) when you follow through.
 In order to chip the ball, bring your foot down onto the ball and don't follow through that much (if at all). You want to strike the ball right under the tip of your shoe, without using your toe.

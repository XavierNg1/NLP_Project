 Setting menu prices properly and tracking the cost of sales is almost impossible without the benefit of knowing the precise cost of each menu item. An optimal total food cost as a percentage of total cost is considered at or below 33%.
 A 3-times mark-up over cost is generally used to determine the price of a menu item. It is not always possible to mark up a menu item by 66%. However, some items can be sold at or below cost, provided other items can make up the loss by being priced above the typical mark-up.

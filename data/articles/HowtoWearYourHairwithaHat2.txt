 No matter the length, curly hair looks cute and playfully feminine when it is paired with a hat. Add some styling mousse to bounce up your curls, or sleep with twisted buns the night before. When you wake up, let the curls fly and throw on a cute cap.This is a great option for the day before you need to wash your hair.
 Pull your hair to the side and separate it into three equal chunks. Braid each strand, one over the other, without pulling too tight. Tie if off at the bottom. This will create a cute loose braid that you can add a hat to for a classically casual look.You can try a loose braid down the back for a variation of this look.
 Woven hats are great for a summertime look. You can style your hair into beachy waves, pull it into a side braid, or straighten it out for a more casual sleek look.Try pairing the woven hat with some worn-in jeans or with a cute sundress.

 A simple looped updo looks best if your hair is parted rather than pulled straight back. You can wear a center part or a part that is slightly off center, whichever you prefer. In order to part your hair, use the end of a comb and run the end along the part line. Then move each hair to the proper side of the part.
 To create a simple looped updo, put your hair in a low ponytail. The ponytail should be positioned just above the nape of your neck. Hold the ponytail in place using a hair elastic. Try and get a hair elastic that closely matches your hair color.








For example, if you have black hair, use a black hair elastic; if you have brown hair, use brown a hair elastic etc.
If you have bangs, you may want to leave a few pieces out of the ponytail to frame your face.
 Once your hair is in a ponytail, grab the end of your hair with your thumb and index finger. Pull the ponytail up and create a loose loop. The size of the loop will depend on the length of your hair. If you have very long hair then you can create a larger loop.
 Using two to three bobby pins, depending on the thickness of your hair, pin the loop in place. The loop should be pinned near the base of the pony tail. Use bobby pins that match the color of your hair.








For the best hold, cross the bobby pins when you pin them into your hair.
 Take the loose ends of the loop and wrap them around the ponytail holder so that it is no longer visible. Pin the end of your hair under the base of the ponytail. You now have a simple and gorgeous looped updo.

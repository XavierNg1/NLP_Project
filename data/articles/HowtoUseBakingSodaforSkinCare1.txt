 Place 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda in the palm of your hand. Add 1 tablespoon (21 g) of organic honey, and use your fingers to carefully combine the two to form a paste.Honey has antifungal and antibacterial properties that make it an ideal ingredient in a facial scrub for acne-prone skin.
Honey has moisturizing properties too, so the scrub also works well for normal to dry skin.
If you don’t have any honey, you can substitute 1 ½ teaspoons (7.5 ml) of water.;
, When you’ve combined the baking soda and honey, use your fingers to carefully massage the mixture onto your face. Rub the scrub into your skin in a circular motion to help loosen the dead skin. Allow the mixture to sit on your skin for 1 minute.Don’t rub the scrub too roughly over your skin, or you may cause irritation and redness.
 Once the baking soda mixture has sat on your skin for a minute, use warm water to rinse it away. Make sure to rinse thoroughly so you don’t leave any residue behind on the skin.If you’re having trouble rinsing your face, you can dampen a microfiber washcloth and use it to remove the scrub.
Apply your usual skin treatment toner, serum, and/or moisturizer after you’ve rinsed the scrub off. Your skin will absorb the products more easily because the scrub has removed the dead skin cells from your face.

 If you are at all visually artistic or into design, this can be a great way to cut costs and make your wedding feel more personal. Wedding invitation designers can charge a lot for their services compared to just basic printing places that you can bring your own design to.
 This might seem tacky, but real quality flowers can be incredibly expensive. There are plenty of flower alternatives that will look just as good from a far and have their own charm up close. Sometimes you can get these for a fraction of the cost of real flowers—and pass them on to another couple once you've used them.
 Again, this can save a lot of money over professional decorations and add a personal touch and flair to your wedding—and be a fun creative experience.
 High end wedding dress shops can charge tens of thousands of dollars for a dress you plan to use once, but there are budget stores out there that offer similarly styled dresses for a few hundred dollars. The same can be said for menswear.


Unlike wedding dresses, a nice conservative suit for the groom can be worn a number of times and might be a good investment for life.
 Everyone knows you don't have to spend a lot of money to throw a great party. Have everyone bring a dish of food, potluck style. Choose a cheaper time of day to hold the reception to save money on the venue. Providing snacks is less expensive than providing a meal. Having a signature cocktail can require hiring extra drink servers, but pouring champagne is easy.
 Leverage the talents of your friends and family to avoid hiring professionals where you can. Do you have a friend who is into photography as a hobby? A cousin who loves to bake who is up to the challenge of a wedding cake? A designer coworker who can whip out a great invitation for a few beers? Know anyone in a great band? Barter favors instead of cash where you can.

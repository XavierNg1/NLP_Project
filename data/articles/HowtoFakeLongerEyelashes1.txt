Look down as you place the curler at the base of your lashes. Clamp down on your lashes and hold for 8 seconds.
Open the curler and move the tool to the middle of your lashes. Clamp down on your lashes for 8 seconds.
Open the curler and slide the tool to the tips of your lashes. Clamp down on your fringe for 8 seconds. Open the tool and remove it from your lashes.

 Water repellents will help preserve your shoes and stop them from becoming water damaged. Repellents come in the form of oils, waxes, and sprays.

Typically, you'll want to apply the water repellent over the entirety of your shoe and then allow it to dry before applying an additional coat.Remember to do a cleaning of your shoe before you apply a repellent.
Popular leather water repellents brands include Meltonian, Obenauf, Scotchguard, and Jason Markk Repel.Make sure that the repellent is designed for leather, not suede.
 Spot cleaning is an easy way to maintain the look of your white shoes. Use a damp rag or paper towel to clean off scuffs, scrapes, and dirt, as soon as they get on your shoes. Check your shoes every day after you get home from work or school and clean off any debris on your shoes. The more diligent you are with regularly spot cleaning, the less you'll have to clean the white leather.
If you have deeper stains, you can use an undyed mild dish soap and a toothbrush to remove the dirt.
 Sunlight can cause yellowing and damage to the leather in your shoes. Keep them in a cool dark spot somewhere in your house when you aren't wearing them to preserve them.

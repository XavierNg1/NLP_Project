 Smooth, tangle-free hair is easier to work with when creating chignons. Pull your hair back into a tight, low ponytail. Make sure it's centered. Secure it with a good hair tie.






;
, Hold one ponytail in each hand. , You want the ponytails to form a loose knot. Smooth down any hairs that may have gotten ruffled when creating your knot.
 Take one end and wrap it around the right side of the knot you have formed. Tuck it under or against the knot (that not looks more like a bun) and secure it with a hair pin. Do the same thing with the other end, only wrap it around the left side of the knot/bun.









If you have particularly long hair, you should try to secure the ends of your hair under the knot.
 A medium-hold hairspray should do the trick, but if you have very long or thick hair, you may consider using extra-strength hairspray. You may also need to use several hair pins, particularly if you have very thick hair.

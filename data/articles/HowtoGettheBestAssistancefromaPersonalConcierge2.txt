 Your efficiency may dip at the office if you keep on thinking about your personal to-do-list. It is better to delegate the task list to personal concierge. Now you need not run to the bank in the short lunch break to deposit your electricity bill, water bill, telephone bill, house tax, etc.; all these services are provided under the concierge service program. Let your concierge assist you in small & sweet ways.
 Personal Concierge makes it a point to deposit all your insurance premiums in time; you need not confront the monotonous calls from insurance officers reminding you of the last date. You have to just ensure that you explain each and everything in detail to the appointed concierge.
 If your friend or a relative stays outstation and requires money urgently and in case you are also busy at the office, then concierge is a trustworthy friend in disguise who can make the bank transactions on your behalf. Other than this, he can also pay your EMIS in time provided you clear him about your financial liabilities beforehand.

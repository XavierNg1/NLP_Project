 Any cardboard box with a lid should work for this project. A shoebox would be the most ideal choice, yet if you want your box to be significantly different in size than a shoebox, feel free to use whatever you can find.;
, From a separate sturdy cardboard box, cut out a square or rectangle to act as your false bottom for your secret box.


Measure the length and width of the cardboard you are using for your secret box. Refer to these measurements when cutting out your false bottom. Do not cut the exact measurements, because then the bottom will not be able to fit into the box. Also, donâ€™t cut too much smaller than the original measurements because then the bottom will not snug into place.
Make sure to cut two half circles on either side of the bottom, this is how you will lift the false bottom out of place with your fingers. , Referring to the measurements of the cardboard you will be using for your box, cut out four thin strips of cardboard to act as the foundation to the false bottom and also the walls to the secret compartment. How much room you have in your compartment will be dependent on how tall or short you make these four pieces. , Take the four cardboard strips you have cut out and glue them to the walls and bottom of your cardboard box. After they dry, place the false bottom piece of cardboard on top of the strips. Check to see if the false bottom passes off as the real bottom of your box.
If all looks good, lift up the false bottom and put your secrets in the hidden compartment, then cover it again with the false bottom.
 Since you used cardboard for this secret box, you can decorate it however you want!

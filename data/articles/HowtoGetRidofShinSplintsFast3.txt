 If you are a runner, you should invest in a high-quality pair of running shoes. Choose shoes that make your feet feel supported and have enough cushioning to absorb the stress of running.
Replace your shoes every 500 miles if you are runner.
Get fitted by a professional to ensure that you are purchasing the right shoe for your sport or activity.
 These are arch supports that fit inside your shoe. You can get these at most pharmacies or you can get them custom made by a podiatrist.
These arch supports can help to ease and prevent the pain of shin splints.
These will fit inside most athletic shoes.
 You can still workout by doing exercises that will lessen the impact of stress on your shins.These include biking, swimming, or walking.
Start any new activity slowly and work your way up to a higher endurance.
Increase the time and intensity gradually.
 You can add some lighter weight strength training exercises to your routine to strengthen the muscles in your calves and shins.Try simple toe raises. Hold weights in both hands. Start at a lighter weight dumbbell.
Slowly rise up on your toes, then lower your heels to the floor.
Repeat this 10 times.
When this becomes easy, increase the weight progressively.

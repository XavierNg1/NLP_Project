, Be smart: avoid getting "stuck" in a certain area and needing to rewash it after you've walked over it. Clean from the far corner of any given room, towards the door, so that you don't end up doing extra work.
 It's important to do this before you introduce water, so that you can sweep it all up without it sticking. You can also vacuum at this stage, if desired.
 You can try baking soda for tile floors; dissolve 1/2 cup of baking soda in warm water, and use it to mop your floors.For wood floors, try vinegar; just combine 1/4 cup of white vinegar with 1 quart of water and use that.,, Walk around carefully so as not to get dirt on the areas you've already cleaned, but keep going until everything has had a good mopping.
 If it gets too grey or grimy, add more detergent/natural products and water. This is a good time to rinse the mop out, too.
 By this time your floor might have some streaks of dirt that the mop missed or even spread. To remove them, wipe the area with clean water, over and over again. Another method is to splash hot water around the floor, wait, and then mop the area twice or thrice. Just avoid flooding your floor!

 The most common way to meet the band is to wait until they come to your area, purchase a ticket, and get backstage. Go to the One Direction website and read the events to find out when are they coming to a town near you.;
, On their future tours, One Direction offers a backstage package that includes a brief meeting and opportunity for photos with the band. This variety of ticket comes with regular passes for the show in any area of the hall, and the backstage portion of the evening.
 If you get the chance to meet the band, make sure you have a specific thing you'd like to talk about or something you'd like signed. You might freeze up from being star-struck, so it helps to have something pre-planned.
 If you can't afford the backstage pass ticket, it's common for groups of fans to wait around after the concert between the exit doors and the band's tour bus. Make sure you obey all the rules of the venue and leave if security asks you to. If the band is feeling up to it, they may sign a few autographs or take a few pictures outside the venue before they leave back to the hotel.


If you can find out where the band is staying in town, you can also wait outside their hotel and see if you can get a chance at meeting the band.

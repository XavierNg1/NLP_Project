 To prevent puckering when you are serging an inside corner, it helps to make a small cut in the fabric starting at the corner.Cut about 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch in from the corner, or the approximate width of your serged stitches., When you are ready to start serging, start at the top of the material. Then, serge straight down the edge towards the corner. As you approach the corner, slow down. You will need to straighten the fabric and serge over the corner slowly., Just before you reach the corner, pull the edges apart to straighten out the corner.Then, continue serging over the corner and turn the fabric slightly as you transition to the new edge.


Another option is to serge down to the corner, stop your machine, and then pivot to continue serging over the next edge. This may be a good option for thicker fabrics that are hard to straighten out., Serge to the bottom of the new edge and go past it by about an inch or two. This will leave a tail that you can sew back into the fabric, or sew over it as you go around an outside corner.
 There may be a few wrinkles in the fabric after you serge over the corner. However, you can simply iron the fabric to get these wrinkles out.

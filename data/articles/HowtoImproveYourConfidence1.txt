 What you read, watch, and listen to affects your mindset. If you are 'over-dosing' on soaps and reality TV, odds are you are also indulging in gossip, adding to the rumor mill. Challenge: reduce the amount of hours of TV you watch each day. Read a book or magazine about a topic you are interested in. Listen to a different radio station or genre of music you have not listened to before. Reason: to challenge the beliefs you hold and also raise your awareness of new and different things.;
, Spend an allocated period of time (10-15 minutes is ok as a start) being quiet and just meditating (or praying) about your life. Challenge: To remove yourself away from others.  Reason: to focus on the power of silence and improve your levels of concentration.
 One of the key steps involved in raising your level of confidence is to believe it for yourself. You need to believe, accept and be in no doubt that you are a confident person. Spend time imagining you at your absolute best. How would you talk, respond to problems, dress and who would you hang out with? Challenge: value the time that you spend doing this process. Reason: to embed the belief within your mind that you are confident

 If there’s a few types of balls that you’re interested in, but you’re not sure which will be best, just get one sleeve (three balls) of each kind. That way you have enough to practice with but you don’t end up with a bunch of balls you won’t use.
 Once you’ve purchased the balls you think might work, head to the driving range or putting green to practice. This gives you a chance to feel them out before you play an actual game.Keep in mind that if you take your new balls to a driving range, you won’t get them back.
 For example, only hit the ones you’re interested in for control first, and then move to those you got for distance. You don’t want to confuse the different types and then end up buying the wrong kind!

, It’s going to be hard to keep track of the things you like or don’t like about each kind of ball. Take a small notepad with you so you can note the differences between the types. This will act as a great reference when you’re ready to buy a larger amount., The clubs you're using and the conditions on the course will affect the type of ball you should use. Having an assortment of golf balls with you, that address different areas of concern, can help you have a great game no matter what.

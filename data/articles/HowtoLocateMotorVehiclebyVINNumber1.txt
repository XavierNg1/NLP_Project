 Although the easiest way to find a car's VIN number is by looking inside the car itself, there are several other methods for locating it:


Request a copy of the car title. This title, as well as the registration, should include the unique VIN number.
Find body shop records. Car shops keep track of the VIN number and report on the changes they have made to it. This is a way that a VIN-based car report can be very comprehensive.
Look in police reports, recall reports and other miscellaneous car data. The VIN number should appear on all these items. You can also ask a former owner of the car to locate some of this data.;
, Local and state police will use the VIN number, as well as the license plate number, make and model, to track down a stolen car.
 The National Insurance Crime Bureau allows you to conduct 5 VIN searches from a single IP address.

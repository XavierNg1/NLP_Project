 Open several sealable plastic bags, making sure that you have one for every shade of glitter that you plan to make. Carefully spoon some salt into the bags. The amount of salt equals the amount of finished glitter, so fill the bags accordingly.You can use whatever type of salt that you like, but epsom salt works especially well for glow-in-the-dark glitter.
 When the salt is in the bags, squirt several drops of non-toxic glow-in-dark-paint in the color of your choice into the bags. The paint is more pigmented than food coloring, so you usually don’t need to add very much. Larger amounts of salt may require more paint, though.Unlike the salt glitter made with food coloring, the glow-in-the-dark glitter is not edible.
If you can’t find glow-in-the-dark paint, you can use a neon formula.
While each bag of salt will be an individual shade of glitter, you can get creative and mix together two or more shades of paint to create a custom color.
 Once you’ve added the paint to the salt, shake the bags well to combine the ingredients thoroughly. It helps to squeeze the salt through the bag as you shake to make sure that it’s completely mixed.If the glitter isn’t as bright or vivid a color as you like, add more paint to the salt and shake the bag again. Repeat the process until you’re satisfied with the color.
 When the salt glitter is colored as you’d like, pour it out onto a cookie sheet, plate, or other flat item. Keep the salt in a single layer, and allow it to dry completely, which should take 4 to 6 hours. When the glitter is dry, you can use it.The salt may clump together with the paint. Don’t worry -- it will easily break apart once it’s dry.

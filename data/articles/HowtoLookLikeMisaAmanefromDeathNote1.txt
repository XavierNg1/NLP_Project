 The artist said he wanted her to have the Gothic Lolita style, "To be a bit different and unique". If you don't know what that is, there is a wikiHow on this website, a Wikipedia page, and you can also find the Gothic Lolita Bible, which is a magazine, in the Graphic novel section of your bookstore. Of course, none of her clothes are exactly Lolita, but they do have some influence. Buying an actual Lolita dress would be a waste of time and money in this case. Clothes that are similar to her style are at Hot Topic and stores like that.;

 Her hair is usually up in high pigtails, or half pigtails, and she also has bangs. Her hair length is pretty long, but do not feel inhibited by that, either.
, The basics are a given. (You know, eyeliner,(whatever color) lip-gloss, a little blush) Don't go too crazy on the makeup. Save that for her clothes.
 In the anime, they are more fleur de lis. Feel free to do either... or both! Or if you're not cosplaying and you want to adopt this into your own style, find your own signature jewelry!

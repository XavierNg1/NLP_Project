 Power packs last longer and create a stronger electric current than a single battery. They're available at hardware stores and battery shops., Instead of using a nail, try using a longer metal rod. Be sure to use it with a power back to create a stronger magnet.
 The more coils you create, the stronger the electric current. Adding a new coil is like adding another magnet. Get more wire and make as many wraps as you can to create a very powerful magnet.

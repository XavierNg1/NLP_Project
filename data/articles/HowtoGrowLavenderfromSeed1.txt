 Lavender seeds can take a while to germinate and should be started early indoors so that they have plenty of time to grow into mature plants during the warm growing season.;
, In this process, seeds should be placed in a sealable plastic bag filled with moist soil. Use a commercial soil specially formulated for starting seeds. Place the plastic bag with the soil and seeds inside the refrigerator and allow it to sit for three weeks.
 The seed starting mix should be a light potting mix that drains well. You can either use a plastic seedling tray or a wide, shallow container without divisions.
 Sprinkle the seeds on top of the soil.


If using a plastic seedling tray, plant one seed per slot.
If planting in a division-free container, space the seeds 1/2 to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 cm) apart.
 A light coating of potting mix protects the seeds, but the seeds also need access to sunlight in order to germinate.
 A heat tray often works best, but another work location may also work as long as the temperature remains around 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius)., Keep the growing medium moist, but not damp, and water the seeds in the morning so that the soil can dry some before evening hits. Soil that is too damp and cool will invite fungus to grow, and fungus will destroy your seeds.
 Lavender seeds can take two weeks to one month to sprout.
 After the seeds sprout, you should move the container to a location that receives plenty of direct sunlight. If no such location is available, place a fluorescent grow light about the sprouts and allow them to sit in the artificial light for eight hours a day.

 Pour the can of chili into a pan over medium heat. Cover and let warm, stirring occasionally.


You can make homemade chili instead, or use the recipe below.
For more flavor, add diced tomatoes and/or canned beans if the canned chili does not include them. Most Texan chili skips both of these ingredients., A "walking taco" is a Frito pie served in the Frito bag instead of a bowl. Each person gets one Frito bag. Cut each bag open along the side instead of the top to make a larger opening.
 Spoon the chili directly into the Frito bag, then top with melted cheese. You can leave this as is to keep the chips crunchy, or stir it together for a delicious mess.


Diced onions and sour cream are optional toppings.
If you want room for more chili, crush some of the chips first by squeezing the bag.

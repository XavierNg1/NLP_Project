 Students for whom the language of instruction is not their native tongue may learn at a slower speed or feel alienated in the integrated classroom. Incorporate them into the classroom by providing bilingual activities and targeted teaching support to address their needs.For instance, assign a teaching assistant to work with non-native speakers during reading lessons.
 Modern classrooms tend to have heterogeneous student bodies, so it’s important that everyone feels included in learning. Make a point of communicating the value of diversity by incorporating lessons that explore multiple cultural perspectives.This could be as simple as reading texts whose authors come from multiple countries or involve more in-depth projects like asking students to investigate and share how education is conducted in various countries.
You can also tap the diverse cultural knowledge that exists within your classroom by asking students to share a story, recipe, or tradition from their family.
Be sure that you consistently offer lessons that engage multiple cultural perspectives. It should not be confined to a single multi-cultural day.
 Some students’ cognition is linked to specific senses that need to be activated in order to maximize their learning. Be sure that your lessons incorporate as many senses as possible, especially sight, hearing, and touch or movement.For example, if you’re teaching vocabulary, you should present each word orally and visually. You might also include a related picture, song, and/or hands-on game to reinforce the word and its definition.
The most common learning styles are visual, auditory, and kinesthetic, which are focused on sight, sound, and movement respectively.

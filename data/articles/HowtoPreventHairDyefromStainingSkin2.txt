 People often concentrate on keeping their hairlines stain-free, but forget about their hands. It’s easy to avoid blue fingers and nails if you wear simple disposable gloves. Wear gloves the whole time you apply the dye, and even the first few times you wash your newly colored hair.








Many hair dye kits come with gloves to make the process easier.
Don’t wear latex gloves if you’re allergic! There are plenty of latex-free alternatives available.
 Ideally, you should wear a long-sleeved, high-necked shirt when you dye your hair. Cover as much skin as you can, to protect against drips that can cause stained skin. Once you’ve been doing this for a while, you’ll probably have a designated dye shirt that you wear every time you color.
 To offer your neck some extra protection, swaddle it in a hand towel that no one will get mad at you for staining. Pull it tightly, and secure with a duckbill or binder clip. This will prevent hair dye from dripping down onto your neck and staining it.
 No matter how carefully you cover your skin, accidents can happen. If dye does land on your face or neck, wipe it off as soon as you notice, using a rubbing alcohol-soaked cotton ball.Then, rinse with water.










It’s best to keep rubbing alcohol and cotton balls handy as you color your hair. Most people have a small mess-up or two.
If you get a giant blob on your neck, remove the bulk of it with a paper towel or toilet paper, then use the cotton ball and rubbing alcohol to get the last of it off.
 If you’re working out, going out in the rain, or in any other circumstance where your freshly-dyed hair could get damp, put it up in a ponytail or bun. Otherwise, residual dye could sneak out and stain your neck or even your shirt. Once you’ve washed your hair a few times, you can relax this rule.

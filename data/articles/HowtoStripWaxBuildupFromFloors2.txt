 Mix 1 cup (240 mL) cream of tartar into 1 gallon (3.785 L) of white vinegar, stirring until the tartar dissolves. Saturate the floor with the solution and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Hand scrub a section of the floor in a circular motion using a nylon scrubbing pad. Wipe with a damp cloth or sponge, then move onto the next section of floor.Repeat this process in any areas that still have wax buildup.
 Mix 3 parts water to 1 part isopropyl alcohol. Before scrubbing the wax with this solution, put on rubber gloves and open your windows to ventilate the room. Scrub the floor using the water and alcohol solution and a stiff scrubbing brush or nylon scrubbing sponge., Mop your floor with clear, warm water after youâ€™ve scrubbed it with the cream of tartar and vinegar or the isopropyl alcohol solution. Dry the floor thoroughly with old towels or rags. Once the floor is dry, you can apply fresh wax.

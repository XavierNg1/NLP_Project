 Carry along a tote bag, backpack, or jacket to store the food in. A baggy sweatshirt or other clothes can work too.;
, Bring small sized food that fits in your mouth easily. Do not bring big foods or foods that you know make sounds. Avoid bringing messy food. Try jelly beans, hand-held jello, chocolate chips, etc.


Opt for little foods that you can hide in your hand on the way to your mouth--raisins, nuts, jelly beans, M&Ms, etc., and food that won't crumble or make noise (crackers are generally not a good idea).
Also, greasy food can stain your notes and make your binders all slippery.
 Try turning sideways and popping your food into your mouth when your teacher is not looking. You could also pretend to cough and then pop the food into your mouth while covering. Dropping your pencil and eating the food then could work too. Break your food into bite-size chunks under the desk if it is too large.


Just be careful. Doing motions that cause distractions, like coughing or dropping something, are more likely to draw attention to you, not take it away.
 Use the concept of "light travels in a straight line". Hunch down and look at your teacher's eyes. Whenever anything blocks your view (e.g. another classmate's head) such that you cannot see your teacher's eyes, it means that he can't see you either. This works well with short teachers and tall classmates.
 Make as little noise as possible and keep your mouth closed. This may mean eating very slowly.
 Most teachers will only allow water, but you can try putting a different beverage in an opaque water bottle before hand. You can also put flavored water or any other clear drink in a plain water bottle. No one will ever know the difference!

, If your teacher finds trash he/she will begin to suspect.

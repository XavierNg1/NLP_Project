 Hold on to the chair or table with your right hand. Bend your left leg so your foot is moving towards the buttocks.
 This should produce a gentle stretch in your left thigh.
 Make sure you don’t bounce. Keep a slow, steady stretch. Keep your back up and look straight ahead. Repeat with the opposite side. You can perform this two to three more times on each side.
 You can also perform a similar exercise while lying down. Lie on your right side. Bend your left knee so that your foot is reaching towards your buttocks. You can use your left hand to wrap in front of your foot to help pull it up to your buttocks. Hold the position for 30 seconds and repeat two to three more times. Then you can alternate to the other side. Make sure you don’t bounce but hold a steady stretch.

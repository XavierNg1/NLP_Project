 The number of times you drain and rinse it is up to you, but draining and rinsing it at least once is recommended.


Use a can opener to open the can, but donâ€™t remove the lid.
Holding the lid in place, flip the can over and hold it over the sink until all the liquid has drained.
Remove the top of the can, and be careful not to cut yourself.
Take the tuna out of the can and place it in a strainer or colander.
Rinse the tuna thoroughly with water, then press the water out using a clean hand or a paper towel.
 In a medium bowl, mix together tuna, eggs, celery, and mayonnaise.


Stir to combine.
Be sure to mix thoroughly so that all of the ingredients are evenly distributed.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
 Divide the mixture evenly between two slices of bread, then top each with the remaining slices of bread to make two sandwiches.


For a crunchy, warm variation, toast the slices of bread before assembling the sandwiches.
You can also substitute a roll or a croissant in place of the sandwich bread for taste and texture variation.
Or you can avoid bread altogether and use the tuna mix over a salad for a lower-carb choice.

 You will need a matchbox full of matches, any kind tape of your choice, and scissors. This particular bomb lets out a slower burning explosion with a bigger flaming effect.
 Be careful not to accidentally strike and ignite any of them.
 Use the end of the striking head as the place you should cut. Dispose of the stick ends. In the end, you should have a pile of small, round, match heads.
 Most boxes will have two strips on either lengths of the box. Dispose of the rest of the box.
 Depending on the size of your striking strip, you should have enough so that it covers the strip from end to end. You will have some match heads left over to use.
 This will keep the match heads in place. The tape will also work to trap the gasses when the match head is ignited and create an explosion.
 Then tape the ends together. This completes the first out of two striking strips.
 Leave some for later to be put into the centre of the structure.
 The striking side or the side with the matches taped on should face outward. In other words, the non-striking sides of both striking strips should be touching. Tape the ends together.
 Then tape over the centre to keep the matches inside.









Although the remaining match heads won't be making contact with the striking strip, they will be lit on fire by the other match heads.
 Seal off the sides of the loops and secure the entire structure.









Tape it tight or almost air-tight. This will ensure the matches stay in place and maximize its combustion effect.
 You can also throw it against the wall or any other safe surface for it to explode.









Have a fire extinguisher or any other fire safety measures at ready in case an accident happens.

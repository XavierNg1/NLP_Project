 Although you don’t need to add any water at this point, it is good to run your press under warm water. Because the majority of your press is made of glass, pouring boiling water into it might crack the glass, ruining it. Just make sure the glass is slightly warm to the touch before brewing your coffee.
 It is imperative that you always grind your coffee right before you brew it, to get the best flavor and prolong how long it lasts before going stale.









If you want to make one cup of coffee, then you need to grind enough for one heaping tablespoon of grounds.
Continue adding additional tablespoons of grounds for more cups of coffee.
While you are grinding your coffee, begin boiling your water in a separate pot. You can do this in a regular stove-top teakettle or an electric teakettle. The perfect temperature for French press coffee is from 195–200 °F (91–93 °C)., Take off the lid from the French press. This should remove the plunger with the attached filter. Pour the desired amount of coffee grounds into the bottom of the glass.
 Once you have secured the filter over the grounds, pour your boiling water into the press. Add one cup of boiling water for each cup of coffee you desire to end up with. Lift up the plunger and stir the grounds with the water to help extract the coffee into the boiling water.
 Leave the press with the plunger up so that the grounds can continue to interact with the hot water. You can set a timer to make sure you allow it to set for the right amount of time; 3-4 minutes is the perfect amount of steeping time.
 Once the time is up, press down the plunger to separate the grinds from the water. Be sure to press down with a slow and steady pace to avoid mixing up the grounds or sloshing the coffee everywhere. Then, finish by pouring into your favorite coffee mug. Enjoy!

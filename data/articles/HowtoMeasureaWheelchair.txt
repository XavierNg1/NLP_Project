Add approximately 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) for slight movement and comfort when sitting. Allow for the thickness of bulky clothing, which could be worn in the winter.;
, This will usually be from directly under one armpit to the other. This will influence the width of the seat back.

 Again, the person should be in a sitting position with both arms at a 90 degree angle. This will determine the height of the armrest in relation to the seat.
 This will determine the height of the seat back.
 This will determine the necessary height of the headrest.

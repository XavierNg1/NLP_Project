 Look at yourself and try to see the inner you. For some people it's easy to see themselves, for others it's hard. Don't get agitated if you can't. You soon will.;
, Try to find the traits that are in the both of you. Maybe you both are generous, unselfish or helpful.
 That tells you a lot about yourself. Sometimes, you change traits when you are with your friends. If that happens, find out the difference between the two personalities. Try to see which one makes you feel better about yourself.
 Be careful that you don't think of yourself as something that you are not.
 Your friends may know a little about you (even if that you isn't the real one). So listen to them when they talk about you. It's not self-absorbed to ask them a few questions about yourself. You can ask what they think of your traits...Don't Get bugged if they tell you something which you don't want to hear. They might joke around and you can laugh with them.
 It's the best trait anyone can possess. Don't be over-confident or have a very low self esteem. Tell yourself that you are the most amazing person in the world and don't care if your friends don't agree. Be social, not a social butterfly. Indulge yourself in school activities, like drama or the sports club. Athletic people are always confident. No one is better than you.

 Painful sex can also be the result of other conditions like Endometriosis or Atrophic Vaginitis. Consult your doctor to rule out other causes for your dryness and discomfort.
 If you’re experiencing pain during sex, you can ask your doctor about estrogen-infused gels or oral prescription medicines designed to help you lubricate naturally.While these medicines are effective, they are not free from side effects. Weigh the pros and cons with your doctor to determine if these treatments are right for you.
 These lubricants will help replace your own natural moisture and lessen pain with intercourse. Options include one-time use lubricants and lubricant capsules that you insert into the vagina once or twice a week to proactively increase vaginal moisture. Be sure to choose a water-based lubricant and avoid oil-based lubricants like petroleum jelly., It’s important to take your time and be fully in the mood for sex before you attempt intercourse. Foreplay is key. This will give your body time to create its own lubrication (as much as possible), which will minimize pain and dryness., If your body isn't cooperating, don't engage in painful sex. This conditions your body to expect intercourse to hurt, and this will do more damage, both physically and mentally, in the long run. Try again another time when you are in the mood and it doesn't hurt as much.


Don't be embarrassed about this. Just as men sometimes need medication to obtain an erection, so too do women sometimes need medicines or extra lubrication to be able to have sex.

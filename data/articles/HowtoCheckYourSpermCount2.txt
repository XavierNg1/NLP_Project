 Tell your doctor you are worried about your fertility, and get an examination. They will ask you about your medical and family history, and perform a physical exam. They will examine your genitals, and may ask you about your sexual history and sexual development., Semen analysis looks at a sample of your semen under a microscope. A lab technician, doctor, or computer count how many sperm appear in the squares of a grid pattern. This is the most common sperm count test, so ask your doctor to schedule you an appointment with a fertility specialist., Semen analysis tests are usually repeated at least twice over a period of time. This is because sperm count varies somewhat, and your doctor will need an accurate representation of your sperm count over time.A second sample is usually collected one to two weeks after the first.

Open the panel and then wipe off all visible areas., Look inside the dryer and use your hands or a vacuum to pick up any visible lint, dirt, or debris. Pay particular attention to the areas surrounding the exhaust vent. Clean the area surrounding the heating element, but be gentle and careful when handling or moving wires around.If you chose to wipe down any metal parts, feel free to use a standard all-purpose cleaner paired with a microfiber cloth., Once you are satisfied that the interior is clean, slide the panel back into place and secure it with the screws. Push the dryer back against the wall and plug it in again. Do a quick dry cycle just to make sure that everything sounds okay.

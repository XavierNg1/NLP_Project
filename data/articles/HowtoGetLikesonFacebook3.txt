 There is such a thing as posting content too often. Too much and your activity becomes a nuisance.


This goes for status updates, pictures, you name it. Dominating a newsfeed increases your chances of getting hidden or un-friended.
 Unless it's something remarkable, avoid posting it. Pictures of your dinner can go on your blog. Your three-legged, talking cat, however? Post away!


Think about whether or not the post is literally something others might like. If it isn't, don't post it. It won't get the reaction you're aiming for.
 Unless you're starting a business and want to fool the masses, there is no reason to do this. Anything that doesn't warrant a true fan of your content just isn't worth it and won't last. Having robots like your page won't make real humans feel similarly.

 Using rubbing alcohol is a safe way to clean glasses without removing finishes, such as non-glare coatings.Put three parts alcohol for every one part of water you mix together.
Make as much as desired, and keep in a small spray bottle for future uses.
Spray and wipe with a clean cotton cloth in a circular motion.
 This works the same as cleaning lenses under running water with dish soap. Add a little bit of soap to a ready-made bottle of diluted alcohol to get that finishing clarity., Since pre-made lens cleaners are specified towards lenses only, the benefit of a diluted rubbing alcohol solution is that it can be safely applied to pieces such as earpieces and nosepieces. Give the entire frame a wipe down to get them back to their original, clean state.
 These chemicals are far too hard on lenses, running risks of damages with expensive repair costs (i.e. coating replacements). Though they may seem convenient, do not add them to any cleaning solutions you plan to make.

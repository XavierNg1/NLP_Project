 Psychic Pokémon work very well against Brawly's fighting Pokémon. Ralts and Abra can be found in the early stages of the game. Zubat/Golbat is another recommended Pokémon for beating Brawly. Since it's a poison/flying Pokémon it only takes a quarter of damage from Brawly's Fighting-type Pokémon. It also learns the strong move wing attack.;
, Since you can't rematch other trainers until you beat the Elite Four, you need to level up by beating wild Pokémon. It's always a good idea to be a couple of levels higher than his strongest Pokémon.
 If your Pokémon gets critically damaged in the heat of the battle, you should use a strong potion to keep the battle going. Gym leaders often hold potions on hand too, but usually not more than two. Beware however, since they will not hesitate to use potions on their Pokémon!

, What are their moves? What Pokémon does he use? Are they too high leveled? Or are your Pokémon still too weak to battle? You can always save your data so you can reset the game to resume where you last saved so that you won't lose your money in case you lose.
 Fight with your high leveled Pokémon and win!

 If you do already, help out some more! This is very important as you want your parents to know you're responsible.;
, It is important that you do them when expected on a timely basis.
 Your time should be shared so that just playing video games and spending time on the internet by yourself is not cool.
 This makes for a closer family bond/unit and when you return home, your parents may want to rest (or go to bed), while you may not be tired...you accompanied them and YOU BEHAVED, and DIDN'T complain, then they should be happy -- and even more so because you were such a good team player.
 If school is in session, you should be in in bed earlier than usual --on summer vacations and weekends it should be no big deal to stay up later than usual.
 Even if you are cramming to study -- you should have been studying while doing your homework (during the daytime) so that at the last minute you're not cramming for a test. A normal extension should be say 1:00 am at the latest 2 or 3 in the morning (and staying up this late only makes sense if it's a holiday or party) maybe during summer and weekends (my daughter sometimes stays up later if I am up --she knows its lights out, when I go to bed and she calls it a night! Remember this makes more sense on weekends, summer, holidays or special events only)

, Then your parents will think you aren't getting enough sleep and will send you to bed earlier!

, Do what's expected of you respectfully and your parents should be more than happy to let you stay up later.
 A common reason is the kid not getting up in the morning. Look alive when you wake up! It'll show, and make your parents think you slept well.

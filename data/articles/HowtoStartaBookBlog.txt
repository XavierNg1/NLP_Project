 Most book bloggers use Blogger, because it's free and the easiest. However, you can also use Wordpress, Tumblr, or any other one you find.;
, It doesn't necessarily have to deal with reading or books, in fact, many successful blogs have catchy names that have nothing to do with reading.
 Decide how you'll place everything on your site. Will you have the picture or title of the book you're reading, and everything else to follow?

, An ideal rating system goes from one to five, however the number's entirely up to you.
 Make little notes about the book as you read it, if you want. Your book blog should be fun to update, not a tedious job.
 Start with the title, then author, your rating, and go! Begin with a summary of the book, then talk about it and describe your feelings. Finally, end with a recommendation for the book or not.
 Create a blog button if you want. Make sure as many people know about as you can.

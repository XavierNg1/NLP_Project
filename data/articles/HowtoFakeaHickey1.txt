 Most hickeys tend to be around the neck area, but hickey can also be found on all areas of the chest.


If you decide to place the hickey on your neck, do so on the sides of the neck avoiding the area underneath your chin, and directly in the middle of your neck (on or surrounding you’re your esophagus). A hickey located on the sides of the neck will help make it more believable.;
, The bottle is the instrument you will use to make the hickey. Place the bottle in between your hands, and squeeze the midsection of the bottle.As you prepare to make your hickey, it helps to stand in front of a mirror so you can see what you’re doing.
 Place the mouth of the squeezed bottle on the area you’ve decided to make your hickey. The mouth of the bottle must be flush with your skin in order to create suction. Hold the bottle in place for approximately 15 seconds. After 15 seconds, pull the bottle away to remove the bottle from your skin.


Keep in mind that the less air there is in the bottle (the more you have squeezed the bottle), the more suction there will be on your skin. This increased suction will lead to a faster forming and more intense looking hickey., Since the mouth of the bottle is a perfect circle, consider moving the bottle over a centimeter or two, and making another hickey. This second hickey doesn’t need to be as intense as the first hickey made, so you can try squeezing the bottle less, or holding it on your skin for a shorter amount of time.


Since mouths have more of an oval shape, widening the hickey will make the look of the hickey more realistic.

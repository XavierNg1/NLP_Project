 Let the laces fall to either side of the shoe.If you’re demonstrating this technique to someone, point the toe side of the shoe toward them so they can see your hand movements.
To make it easier for children, color the bottom of the other shoelace brown, the middle part of the lace green, and the top part of the lace brown. This way, when you instruct them to make a loop with the lace, it can look like trying to form a “tree” by always making sure the green part of the lace is at the top of the loop, like the leaves at the top of a tree.;
, Take both laces and thread one lace over the other and then pull them tight. They should form a knot in the middle of the shoe.
 You should be holding the lace between your thumb and your first two fingers.








If you are using the “tree” trick, instruct your child to form a loop with the colored lace so the brown parts of the lace are on top of each other (the trunk of the tree) and the green part sits at the top of the loop (the leaves of the tree).
 You should be holding it over your fingers and around the loop. Wrap the other lace toward you rather than away from you.








Again, if you are using the “tree” trick, instruct your child to wrap the shoelace with the knot over the “trunk” of the tree.
 You should use your free hand to pull the shoelace through. There should now be a hole between the looped shoelace and the wrapped shoelace. Pull the wrapped shoelace through so it comes through this hole.








Another way to explain this is to have your child poke the knot on the shoelace through the hole to make another loop.
 You should now have a nicely tied shoe.


You can also instruct your child to pull the knot and the top of the tree trunk to either side, tightly.

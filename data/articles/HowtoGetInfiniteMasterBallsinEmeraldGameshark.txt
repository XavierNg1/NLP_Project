 Emulators allow you to take a snapshot of your game at any time. This will allow you to quickly restore your working game in case something goes wrong (and there's always a chance something will go wrong when using codes).


In VisualBoyAdvance, click "File" → "Save Game" and then choose an empty slot. You can reload the game state using the "Load Game" menu.;
, This will open a new window for entering cheats.
 This will open a window allowing you to enter a Gameshark code.
 You'll need this small code enabled before you turn on the Master Ball code. Enter "master code" into the description and then paste the following code into the "Code" field:
D8BAE4D9 4864DCE5

, Enter anything you want into the "Description" field, and copy the following code into the "Code" field. Note that this code is for the North American and European release of Pokémon Emerald.82005274 0001

, Once the Master Ball code has been entered, you can purchase as many as you'd like for free from any Poké Mart. Simply walk up to the register and purchase a "Poke Ball" to get a Master Ball for free. You can only buy a single Master Ball per transaction, but you can purchase as many as you'd like.


If you were already in a Poké Mart when you entered the code, you may need to exit and re-enter.
 Once you've stocked up on Master Balls, you'll want to disable the code so that the store returns to normal. Open the "Cheat list" window and uncheck the two lines of Master Ball codes.


You may have to exit and re-enter the store for the stock to change back to normal.
 Any time that you need to pick up more Master Balls, just check the boxes for the code again in the "Cheat list" window.

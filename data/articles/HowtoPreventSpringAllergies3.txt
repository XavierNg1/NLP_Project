 If you’ve gone through all the preventative measures and still suffer allergies, consider taking an antihistamine regularly. Take it thirty minutes before going outside in order to prevent allergy symptoms. Look for non-drowsy formulas to stay clear-headed all day. Remember to check with your doctor first about taking medications, and be sure to follow proper dosage instructions., Your doctor can either offer you an allergy test, or refer you to a specialist. The most common allergy test is a skin test, in which a tiny amount of an allergen is pricked into the skin’s surface. If it becomes red or irritated, that means you’re allergic to the substance. It might seem a bit off-putting, but it’s essential to stop the guesswork and know exactly what your allergies are.


It’s wise to consult an allergist/immunologist for proper diagnosis of seasonal and year-round allergies. An allergy specialist can help you understand your particular triggers and peak season(s).
There’s also evidence that optimizing your care options with even a one-time consultation can decrease the financial burden of allergy management. That means it’s cheaper in the long run!, You might want to consider long-term consultation if you test positive for a diverse array of allergies and find it difficult to manage your symptoms on your own. Your allergist can also help you understand and manage allergies that persist over time despite your best efforts to control your environments. They can prescribe stronger antihistamines, nasal sprays, eye drops, and other means of improving your condition.

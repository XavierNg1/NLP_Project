 You want to start by getting two small (very small) bowls (that can go to the oven). Okay, prepare them separately, just so there's no mix up.
 First, cut the white chocolate with a knife, making small risps, divide the risps into 4 portions (two per each tartare). Put one portion of the chocolate on the bottom, mix with a spoon the eggs, the flour and the milk add it on top of the chocolate, which will float on different levels, causing a great sensation and vibe to the food. Put the bowls in the oven (or even microwave) for about 45 minutes (50 in the microwave), Make sure its small, like an " individual" one. Take off the crust with a sharp pointed knife, boil some water and put the lobster on it, for about 1 hours, later, let it "cool" a bit (about 15 minutes) and put it back on the oven for 30 minutes, then put it in the bowl, Cut the strawberries into small pieces and mix them with the blueberries and blackberries. Get the carbonated water, separate in four (two per each tartare), boil one portion (about 1 minute) and add on top. Wait, add the cold part, and the pepper, sliced.

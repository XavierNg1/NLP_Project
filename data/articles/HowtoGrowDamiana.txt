 Make sure the soil is damp and put the pot in a sunny spot so the seed can germinate. If you have sown them during the early spring or late winter months don’t put them outside just yet, wait until you know there is going to be no more frost.;
, Again, wait until you are sure that there is going to be no more frost before you put the plant outside. Pick a nice sunny spot in your yard. Southern exposure would probably be your best bet.
Another good tip for you planting your Damiana outside is if you do live in a colder climate plant the seeds in a large pot that can be placed in the ground outside. This way when winter comes you can simply dig up the pot and bring it inside during the winter months. If you do that be sure to put it in a nice sunny room or green house.
 Where it will grow just fine in rich or sandy soil it needs to be moist but not flooded.
 You want to make sure to prune any shoots that look ratty to make your plant look nice. Don’t toss the leaves though; you can dry them to make tea.

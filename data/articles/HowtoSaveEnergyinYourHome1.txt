 Turning your thermostat down by just 1 degree can reduce your energy consumption by over 5%. You won't even notice the difference in room temperature. On the same note, don't heat rooms when you are not using them.;
, Your hot water thermostat needn't be higher than 60 degrees centigrade (140 degrees Fahrenheit). Any higher and you will only be mixing it with cold water to cool it back down for use.


Give your boiler regular checkups, especially if you have had it for a few years.
 Only use the washing machine when you have collected a full load. If you must wash a partial load, use the economy or half load setting. Also, modern washers work just as effectively at 40 degrees Centigrade (100 F) as they do at 60 (140 F), but the reduced temperature will make a difference in terms of energy used.


Tumble dryers use up a huge amount of energy. If possible, hang your clothes on a line instead. This is better for your clothes as well.
Washing economically doesn't just apply to your clothes. Taking a shower instead of a bath uses around 50 percent less energy.
 When you turn on the tap to wait for hot water, for example, put a container under the tap until the water is warm enough and then use the water in the container to water plants or use for other purposes.

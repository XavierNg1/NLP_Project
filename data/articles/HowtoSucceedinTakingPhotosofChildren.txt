 When taking photos of children indoors, use ISO 400 as the setting on your camera and use the flash as well. It will help with movement, shadows and will avoid fuzziness. During the day, take photos of children using ISO 200 to help avoid blurring.;
, That way, you don't even have to interfere with the game and children can keep on playing away happily as you snap away.
 It's a habit we all acquire but if you ask a young child to smile - what is the usual response? They grimace, frown, groan or poke out their tongues. Instead of insisting on the smile, talk with your kids, try to make them laugh and goof around a bit. At the same time, be 100% ready to take the photos at any moment.
 Capture kids at play, in concentration mode or talking to their grandparents and family members. Posing should be reserved for rare occasions; the best shots are those taken as the children are doing what comes naturally.
 The best photos of children are those taken at their level. Get down on your knees for the kids and down on your belly for the babies. The results are worth the dirty knees and sore bones!

, From as early an age as possible, use the camera around them so that they get used to it and don't fret upon its appearance.
 Familiarisation with cameras is a good pastime for kids. They have a different and equally valid perspective worth sharing - let them gave a go now and then and add their efforts to your photo album to encourage them.

 Then, fold your arms on your desk and rest your chin on your arms so your face is facing the teacher. As a variation on this method, if you are allowed to have a backpack or large bag during class, place it on your lap and fold your arms over it as if you are hugging it. Rest your head on top of the bag, instead of the desk, as this gives you a more upright posture, and looks less suspicious. Sweet dreams!

 No one would really remember to pay attention to someone called xXlucy22239423932898923938927u29Xx. Use something Cute such as "Love Lucy", "Carrot", "Gabbie" etc. Make sure you don't use any inappropriate names.;
, Some Yoville clothes can be expensive, so If you are on a budget then try to find cheap but good-looking clothes. Watch out for Yovillians selling cheap accessories or costumes. Look at the back of Yoville's Clothes Shop, or try looking in the Males section! The more creative the better.
 This screams "cute lifestyle".
 Depending what you are talking about, there is a smiley for everything. But try to avoid using ten Smileys in a two word Sentence., This proves to others that people like you.
 It will get you a bad reputation.

 Face your palms away from you, and spread out all ten of your fingers. Note that this method only works when you are multiplying 9 by a number between 1 and 10.
 Beginning on the left, count your fingers until you reach that digit. Put down that finger.

For example, if you are multiplying 9×6{\displaystyle 9\times 6}, you would put down the thumb of your right hand.
 You are looking at all the fingers to the left of the finger you put down. This number of fingers tells you the digit in the tens place of your product.For example, you have 5 fingers to the left of the thumb you put down. That means the tens digit of your product is 5.
 You are looking at all the fingers to the right of the finger you put down. This number of fingers tells you the digit in the ones place of your product.For example, you have 4 fingers to the right of the thumb you put down. That means the ones digit of your product is 4. So, 9×6=54{\displaystyle 9\times 6=54}.

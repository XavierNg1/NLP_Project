 Veterinarians and animal shelters always need towels, sheets and blankets.
 Save worn and stained towels to dry your car after washing it. Donate old towels to a church or other nonprofit group to use for fundraising car washes.


Cut some towels into convenient sizes for cleaning rags also (see above).

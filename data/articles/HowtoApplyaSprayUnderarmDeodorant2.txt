Is a regular formula strong enough to last you all day, or would a longer-lasting or time-released formula be more beneficial?
Is your skin prone to allergic or other severe reactions to common ingredients like aluminum?
Is regular-strength deodorant sufficient to kill all of your odor-causing bacteria, or do you need an extra-strength formula?

Avoid those with a high amount of zinc, since this can irritate the skin., Find more than one that works well for your body. Expect your body to build a natural immunity to a particular formula after repeated use. Change your brand or formula of deodorant every half-year or sooner if you notice more B.O.To save money, start with sample or travel sizes, if available, to test each product's quality.

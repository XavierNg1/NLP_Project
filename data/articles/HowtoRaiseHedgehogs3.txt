, Start out slow so that your hedgehog gets used to your presence.
 This puts the hedgehog under unnecessary stress, which is inappropriate when the hedgehog is already scared. Instead, place the hedgehog in a safe, quiet place. Take things slower the next time so that the hedgehog gets more comfortable with you.
 You can also place a rough rock in the cage so that the nails wear down more naturally so that you do not have to cut them so frequently.

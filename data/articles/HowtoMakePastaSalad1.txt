 You want the pasta to be well-seasoned, since you don't be relying on fancy sauces to flavor it.
 Most pastas will need 9 to 12 minutes to cook. You do not want the pasta to be overcooked or it will fall apart when you toss it with the rest of your ingredients. Also, the pasta will soak up the dressing the longer it sits; if you overcook it, it will become soggy later on.


Pasta with lots of shapes, nooks, and crannies are the best for pasta salads, becuase they can hold more dressing and small ingredients. Consider any of the following: fusilli, farfalle, rotini, and penne., Hold a large strainer or colander over a sink and dump the pasta into it. Once the water is gone, run cold water over the pasta for a few seconds. Shake and jiggle the strainer/colander so until there is no water left. Rinsing the pasta with cold water will halt the cooking process and prevent it from overheating.


On the other hand, rinsing the pasta will get rid of all that extra salty flavor. Consider tossing the pasta with some olive oil instead, and spreading it on a large baking sheet so that it can cool off., This will allow the pasta to absorb the flavors better. Take about two thirds of your dressing, and toss it with your pasta while it is still warm. Set the rest of the dressing aside for later., This will allow it to cool down. You don't want to use warm pasta for pasta salads.

 If you feel too scared to do it yourself, ask a friend to (Note: This will most likely make them say no because they will either think you don't have enough confidence or that it's a joke). Remember to not worry too much if they say no. Just keep working on them and they'll come around.
 It shows that you aren't grumpy and unpleasant to be with. Try to make him/her smile.

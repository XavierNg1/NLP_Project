 You can make fresh apple pie filling using a stove top, if you would rather use cornstarch than flour.


Combine 1 cup (236ml) of water, 1 tbsp. (15ml) of apple juice, 1 cup (200g) of sugar and 1/4 cup (32g) of cornstarch with your spices in a saucepan.
Heat on medium, stirring regularly. Remove from heat when thickened and bubbly.
 (5ml) of vanilla extract. Pour this extract over your blanched or fresh apples before you mix them with sugar.
 Use these traditional apple pie fillings with a pie crust and a crumb mixture.


A Dutch apple pie is covered with an oat crumb mixture, rather than a second pastry crust.
Add the fresh pie filling to your bottom crust. Combine 1 cup (125g) of flour, 1/2 cup (95g) of packed brown sugar, 1/4 cup (39g) of instant oats and 1/3 cup (79ml) of melted butter. Mix it together with your hands.
Place the Dutch apple pie crumbs on the top of the apple pie filling before baking.



Pour your apple pie filling into a cast iron pan.
Place a single pie crust on the top. Push the edges down and slit the top of the crust 4 times.
Bake inside your oven, according to traditional pie crust temperature and time. Check it regularly to tent the crust when necessary.
 If you want to try a twist on a non-traditional recipe, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup (20 to 40g) of shredded aged cheddar or Comte Swiss cheese.


Place the cheese over the filling, and then cover it with a pie crustÂ  or pastry lattice.

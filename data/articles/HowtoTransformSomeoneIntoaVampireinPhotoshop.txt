 Use +Crtl + O to open the FileOpen-Dialog. Now select the photo you want to use. Make sure it's a good picture - one where you can see the person's face very well and quite clearly.;
, Zoom in (by pressing Ctrl + Alt and scroll on your mouse) to the persons eyes. Now select the normal brush tool and make it smaller.


Select the colour red. Now colour in the person's eyes. Only colour the bit that is already their eye colour. I.E - If their eyes are blue, colour the blue bit. Most new vampires have red eyes, so that would be a good option, although you can always make them golden sort of colour.
 Look at the box with the layers and click the drop down menu. Select 'Soft Light'. The eyes should look very realistic.
 Create yet another layer. Do exactly the same as what you just did, but with the lips. Select the colour red, and colour the whole of their lips. Now press 'soft light' again. If their mouths are closed, you should have coloured the whole lips and now they are very red and look extremely realistic. If their mouths are open, still colour the lips but NOT the teeth - obviously!

, Create yet another layer and zoom in on their teeth. Use the brush and colour the teeth in white. It doesn't matter if you make all the teeth look like one long tooth - because when you select 'Soft Light' it will make them separate again but very white!

, Go back to the background layer for this one. At the top, make sure 'highlights' is selected. And '15'.
 Keep clicking until the face has gone pale. Be careful not to overdo it! You may have to make the brush smaller and zoom in afterwards to get any places you missed or can't get at.,,

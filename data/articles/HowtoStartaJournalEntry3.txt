 One way many people approach their journal is by writing at a planned time every day. That way, starting an entry will be as simple as sitting down at a given time and writing.


Many people who journal regularly like to journal right before bed at night. This way the experiences of the day are fresh in your mind.
Think about journaling in the morning. It might be relatively easy for you to start an entry right when you get up., For a lot of people, it’s hard to find the time to start a new entry every day. Thus, you can take the approach of beginning an entry whenever you have time. This way, you won’t feel as if you are forced to produce a new entry every day.


Journal on weekend mornings or evenings when you have time.
Think about starting entries on holidays or days off from work.
Start an entry when you feel like it.
 One way to approach journaling is to only create an entry when you have a major life event. This way, when you do journal, it’ll be very easy to start because you’ll have an important issue or event to write about. Major life events might include:


The birth of a child
A wedding or divorce
The death of a loved one
The start of a new job
Moving houses

 Add about 2/3 to 5/6 of the frosting and 2-3 drops of blue food coloring to one bowl and 1/6 to 1/3 of the frosting and 1-2 drops of yellow food coloring to another bowl. Mix thoroughly to get the desired color pigment you want for the jeans.
 Doing this makes the cake flat. Turn the cake upside down and place it vertical in height., This will become the "belt" of the cake., You can use a pre-made template or eyeball it. Place a toothpick about 2 inches (5cm) in the center from the top and 2 toothpicks on the bottom, 2 inches (5cm) from each side. Cut in a triangular form, using the toothpicks as guides.







Cut a symmetrical triangle inside the triangle wedge. These two pieces will be used to extend the bottom hems of the jeans.
 Trim off the belt to the size of the cake length., Cover and frost the cake evenly with half of the blue frosting. Place in the refrigerator for the frosting to harden.,, If you don't have one, you can use a sandwich baggie and make a very small hole at the bottom. Dab small indents on the cake to create pocket outlines, the zipper, and bottom hems., Tear 2 thin slices of roll-up and make tassels. Dab on yellow frosting along the buckle and lay M&Ms on top to create a stud style., Place a piece of fruit roll-up by the knee to create a patch and outline it with yellow frosting dots. Make up your own designs relying on your imagination.

 You'll be slow-cooking the carnitas for a longer period of time for extra juiciness and tenderness.
 Carnitas calls for a fatty cut of pork, so butt roast is the ideal cut to work with.


If you'd like, trim off any large pieces of fat from the pork as you cut the chunks. Although it's not necessary, it does make a healthier carnitas. If you leave the fat on the pork pieces, much of it will render into the pan while it cooks, coating the carnitas and making them even juicier.
 You can boil your carnitas or simmer them on the stovetop, but you get the most consistent results baking your carnitas, them broiling them for a crispy finish. Place the butt roast pieces into the smallest casserole dish you have, with:


1 white or yellow onion, peeled and quartered
4-6 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled
2 tablespoons lime juice (about 1 lime)
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon dry oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2 bay leaves
The juice of 1 orange, with the orange rind itself (quartered)
salt and pepper

, Which liquid you choose is up to you. Know that if you choose to cook with oil instead of a non-fatty liquid, your carnitas will turn out much juicier.Of course, it won't be healthy, but it's okay to splurge a little for the sake of a true delicacy. Here are some options you can use to cover the carnitas:


Vegetable oil
Rendered lard
Water
Orange juice

, After an hour, the carnitas should reach a temperature of about 208Â° F, and stay there until the meat has finished cooking 2 hours later.
, Broil until the tops of the pork become crispy and darken.
 When done perfectly, you'll have crispy carnitas that's still succulent and tender.
 Top with onion relish and tomatillo salsa.

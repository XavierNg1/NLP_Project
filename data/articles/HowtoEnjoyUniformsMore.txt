 There is nothing you can do if the head of your school wants students to wear uniforms. You'll have to live with it, no matter how hard.;
, Having uniforms means less time stressing on what to wear to school. It also means that everyone is dressed the same, so, some people that don't have great fashion sense don't feel left out.
 One of the worst - looking types of uniforms are the ones that are way too big or way too small. Tight-fitting clothes will be uncomfortable to sit in, and will attract your strict teacher's attention.
 Okay, you're not the prettiest girl at school- so what? You may think uniforms make everyone look alike, but faces are all different. There is no one like you. Express your individuality by styling your hair different, or wearing cool earrings.
 Take a shower in the morning, preferably a cold one, to wake you up! Scrub in some lovely-smelling shower lotion and wash off. Apply some body lotion and deodorant. Smelling good is vital with uniforms too. Smell different and feel different, too.
 Some schools don't allow a trace of makeup. Apply a little mascara and a nude shade of gloss. Voila! Natural beauty here she comes!

, If you're feeling hot, ask to turn on the AC or drink some water to cool off. If you're cold, bring a sweater(according to the rules,) and ask to turn off the AC. Hem your skirt if it's too long.
 You'll be walking around a lot. Make sure it's okay with the rules of whatever shoes you want to wear. Black tennis shoes are cool as well as comfy. Think about it!

, Crying about uniforms won't help and will make you depressed easily. It's just wearing uniforms! Don't feel as if you'll never get used to it- you will.

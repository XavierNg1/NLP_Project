 When greeting someone before lunch, this is the standard way to say “hello.”


Time-specific greetings are more significant in Japan than in the United States. While you can technically say “konnichiwa” in the morning, greeting someone with “ohayō gozaimasu” is much more common.
The kanji for this greeting is お早うございます. The hiragana is おはようございます.
You could also shorten your morning greeting to "ohayō" when speaking to friends and others with whom you are on familiar terms. The kanji for ohayō is お早う and the hiragana is おはよう.
Pronounce this greeting as oh-hah-yoh goh-za-ee-muss.
 After dinner, you would begin greeting others with this phrase rather than “konnichiwa.”


As with other time-specific greetings, konbanwa is the standard greeting to use during the evening. You could use konnichiwa, but the latter is far less standard.
The kanji for this phrase is 今晩は. The hiragana is こんばんは.
Pronounce konbanwa as kohn-bahn-wah.



Note that oyasumi nasai is more often used in parting as a way of saying “good night” late at night rather than “hello." You might get some strange looks if you use this when you meet someone, even if it's really late in the night.
When you are among friends, classmates, close family members, or anyone else with whom you can speak to familiarly, this phrase can also be shortened to oyasumi.

The hiragana for oyasumi is おやすみ. For the entire phrase, oyasumi nasai, the hiragana is おやすみなさい.
This greeting is roughly pronounced as oh-yah-soo-mee nah-sigh.

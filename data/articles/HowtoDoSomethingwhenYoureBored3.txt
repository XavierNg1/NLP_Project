 One of the best parts of traveling is being in places where there are lots of people to look at. Whenever you're bored in a busy place )train station, airport, bus depot, cafe, and so on) look around you at the people you're sharing the space with.


Make up stories about the people you see. That woman wearing the zebra print leggings? She's an international spy on her way to a meeting with her superior. She's wearing the garish clothes to draw attention away from her face.
 Listen to the conversations going on around you. try to find the strangest conversations to listen in on and make sure that the people don't notice you spying on them. Act like you're reading a book or magazine, instead.


Write down what you hear and turn it into a short story or a poem.
If you're traveling with another person, turn it into a game. See who can overhear the weirdest conversation or sentence.
 When you're traveling you can be anyone you want to be. Come up with a mildly plausible persona and stick to it while you're on the airplane, at the bus depot, waiting for the train, etc. See if you can get people to believe your persona.
 Sometimes this is the only way to keep yourself amused, whether you're a child or an adult. You can do the usual "I Spy" games, which are especially good for kids in the car. You can also make up your own games, depending on where you are.


Make up a points system for annoying people. This can help if you're stranded somewhere during the holiday rush season. There are always intensely irritating people and turning their annoying habits into a game can make them more bearable. For example: you get +10 points when that guy cuts you off in line, or +5 for the child who screams through the entire plane ride.
 See what everyone else is up to and relay your odd traveling experiences to them. You can brainstorm ideas for ways of filling your time. You'll have someone to talk to and you'll get to pass the time.

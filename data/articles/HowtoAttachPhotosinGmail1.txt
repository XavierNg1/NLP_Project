 Make sure that under the word “Google” (on the upper-left part of your screen), the word “Gmail” appears. If you see “Contacts” or “Tasks” instead, click that word, then choose “Gmail” from the drop-down menu.;
, Click it, and a blank email message box will appear.
 At the bottom of your blank message box, you will see an icon that looks like a paper clip. Hover your mouse over it.
 When you hover your mouse over the paper clip, a new set of icons will appear. One of them looks like a camera; if you hover over it, it will read “Insert Photos.” Click it.
 When you click on the camera icon, a dialog box reading “Add an Image” will appear, and the rest of your screen gets grayed out. You now have the option to choose how you’d like to add the photo (either by uploading it from you computer or by entering an image URL from a website). For this method, you want the default selection: uploading from your computer.
 Click “Choose File,” and a window that allows you to select photos from your computer will open. Navigate to the location of the image you’d like to add, and select it.
 Once you’ve selected your file, click “Open” at the bottom of the window, and wait for the file to upload.


If you change your mind, you can cancel the upload and start over during this window of time.
 Once the image has uploaded, enter your recipient’s email address, your subject line, and any message you wish to send.
 You have now sent an email with your chosen photo attached.

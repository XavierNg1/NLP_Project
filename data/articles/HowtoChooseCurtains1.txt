 Faux silk, chintzes, brocades, and cotton canvas tend to be the sturdiest and least prone to sun rot


If unlined, silks are particularly susceptible to sun rot.
If you’re buying fabric to have your curtains custom-made, make sure to use decorator fabric specifically. The thread count is typically higher, so they last longer.;
, They’re perfect for small spaces that you want to be sunlit, since sheer materials are thin and take up very little room. Sheers also provide natural ventilation.If privacy is a concern, choose semi-sheers, which offer a subtle amount of privacy without sacrificing the natural lighting.


If you have allergies, consider sheer fabrics. They are excellent at preventing pollen from entering open windows.
Sheers come in a range of materials, including cotton, silk and synthetics. Cotton is the most cost-effective choice.
 When you need very long curtains to cover large spaces, choose a fabric that will hang heavily. Heavy fabrics like velvet, velveteen, suede, corduroy, tapestry and wool-blends will stay put in front of your windows and shield the most light from the room.


If cold winters are an issue, heavy fabrics will help insulate the room and increase the energy efficiency of your heating system.Another option would be using cotton duck curtain lining, which is very heavy and thick.
 They will also decrease the sound of outside noise.Black-out curtains are usually made of very heavy polyester or Thermaweave, which is woven fabric that also provides insulation.


These specialty curtains can usually be found at any home furnishing store. They come in a wide range of prices.
Seek out curtains that are labelled with terms like “blackout,” “room-darkening,” and/or “light-blocking.”

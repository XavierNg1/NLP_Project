 This experiment simulates how acid rain affects the environment and plants. To do it, you will need two small potted plants, sulfuric acid, distilled water, an eyedropper, a pH meter or pH strips, and a spray bottle.If you want to do this easily at home, you can use vinegar or lemon juice instead of sulfuric acid. You don’t need an eyedropper or pH meter if you use vinegar or lemon juice., When working with strong acids like sulfuric acid, you need to wear a lab coat, gloves, and safety goggles. Always wear this protective equipment when handling the sulfuric acid. Adult supervision is required for this process.


Do not lean over or breathe in the acid.
 Fill a small container with distilled water. The exact amount isn’t important, but one cup of water should be sufficient. Using the eyedropper, add some sulfuric acid to the water, stir, and check the pH with the pH meter. Keep adding sulfuric acid and stirring until the water has a pH around 4.0.If you’re using pH strips, dip the strip into the water and wait until the strip changes color. Compare that color to the key to determine what the pH of your solution is. Keep checking the pH with a new strip each time until you get to 4.0.
If you’re using vinegar/lemon juice, skip this step.
 Add your acidic water (or vinegar/lemon juice) solution to a spray bottle and spray one of the plants with the “acid rain”. Spray the second plant with plain distilled water. Repeat this process once a day for a week and observe the results.Monitor the state of your plants over time, noting the effects on the plants.
After a few days, you should notice that the plant sprayed with the acid rain develops brown/yellow leaves and is badly damaged compared to the plant with just distilled water.

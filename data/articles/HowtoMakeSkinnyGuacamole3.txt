 Wash 1 large ripe avocado and carefully slice it in half lengthwise. Pop out the pit and slice the avocado flesh, so you make cubes. Use a large spoon to gently scoop the cubes out of the avocado. Place the cubes in a serving bowl., Dice enough red onion to measure 1/4 cup (40 g) and enough tomatoes to measure 1/4 cup (50 g). Place these in the serving bowl along with 1 tablespoon of chopped cilantro and 1/2 teaspoon of minced jalapeno.If you'd like spicier guacamole, you can use more jalapeno.
 Measure Â¼ cup (71 g) of Greek yogurt into the serving bowl. Squeeze 1 teaspoon of lime juice into the bowl and add salt and pepper to taste., Use a fork or potato masher to mash the guacamole a little, so the ingredients are combined and the guacamole becomes a little smooth. If you like your guacamole smoother, mash it more. Serve the guacamole right away with baked tortilla chips or fresh vegetables.You can store the guacamole in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one day. Stir it again before you serve it because the yogurt may separate a little.

 It's important to sanitize the jars and lids before using them to can tomatoes. If have a dishwasher, wash the jars and lids using the sanitize cycle. If you don't have a dishwasher, or if your dishwasher doesn't have a sanitize cycle, wash the jars and lids in hot, soapy water. Then, submerge them in boiling water for five minutes to kill any lingering germs., Do not fill your jars all the way up with soup. It's important to leave a little headspace. Leave about half an inch (about 1.3 centimeters) of headspace on top of the jar. Then, slide a spatula between the side of jar and the soup. This should remove any air bubbles., Seal each lid completely. Place the lids on and screw them until you you cannot turn the lids. Then, add the rings that go over the lids. Screw them on until you cannot make any more turns.
 Add enough water to the canner that there is three inches (about 7.5 centimeters) of water on the bottom. Place your jars in the individual compartments of your canner found in the center. Then, screw the canner's lid in place.It is not necessary to weigh down the canner's lid with anything. Simply screw it into place.
If your pressure canner has a valve, leave that opened.
 Turn the canner to the highest heat setting. For 10 minutes, let heat escape from the valve or sides of the canner. Set a timer to make sure the jars do not steam for too long., When the water in the canner comes to a boil, set a timer. Let the jars process for 20 to 30 minutes.If your canner comes with a weight to weigh down the lid, put it on during processing and close any valves on your canner., After the jars are done processing, open the canner and use tongs to remove the jars from the canner. Let them cool on a wooden drying rack or towel. Once the jars are cool to the touch, loosen the rings slightly to prevent rust.

 Small boxes may well contain jewelry, but might also be host to gift cards, rare collectible trinkets, tickets to a show, or even the graphic tee you wanted rolled into a small box.
 A big box could contain a game console, a laptop, or the popcorn machine you asked for. Gifts come in all shapes and sizes. If you wanted aÂ guitar, it's a good idea to look for big boxes.
 Who bought it? If some members of your family have more money their gifts may be more expensive.

 Hemp body butter has very natural, earthy scent, perfect to use on dry skin during the winter months. Hemp oil nourishes the skin, and honey is a natural moisturizer with antibacterial properties. Here's what you'll need:


3 tablespoons coconut butter
1 tablespoon beeswax
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon sunflower oil
1 tablespoon castor oil
1 tablespoon hemp oil
10 drops essential oil of your choice

, Prepare a double boiler, or create a makeshift one by filling a large pot with a few inches of water and setting a smaller pot inside. Heat the boiler over medium high heat, until the water starts to simmer. Place the 3 tablespoons coconut butter and 1 tablespoon beeswax in the smaller pot. Stir until the mixture melts, and keep heating it for 15 minutes so it won't get grainy.It's important to melt the mixture slowly to ensure it doesn't burn.
 Stir constantly as you add 1 tablespoon of honey, 1 tablespoon sunflower oil, 1 tablespoon castor oil and 1 tablespoon hemp oil. Keep stirring until everything is completely incorporated.
 Allow the mixture to cool for 10 minutes, then stir in 15 to 20 drops of the essential oil of your choice.
 Scoop the hemp body butter into small, sterile containers.

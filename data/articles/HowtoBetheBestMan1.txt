 Choose an activity and location which are informed by his interests and personality. For instance, if your friend loves paintball, organize the party as a massive paintball battle. Between rounds of paintball you could enjoy some pizza and reminisce about your friend.


Whatever you choose to do, think about the activities and hobbies which your friend and others can enjoy together. Camping, golfing, or getting a suite at a basketball or baseball game are all fun options.
Do not invite raunchy characters like strippers to your bachelor party. Do not host your bachelor party at morally questionable sites like casinos or strip clubs.Since your friend is getting married, he has reached a stage of maturity where such things have long since ceased to hold interest for him.;
, You should select a date which is neither too close nor too far from the wedding date. If it’s too far, it won’t be relevant. If it’s too close, the groom might not have time to prepare for the wedding. Two weeks before the wedding date is usually a good choice.If the groom has many friends who are traveling from out-of-state, you might need to move the date back further so that the traveling friends don’t have to make the trip too many times in a short period of time.
 Don’t fail to invite someone just because you personally don’t like or get along with them. The bachelor party is about surrounding your friend, not you, with supportive people who matter to them.


If the bachelor party is going to be a casual event, you can simply organize it with an email or phone call instead of a formal invitation.
Let the guests know politely that they are responsible for their own expenses, and that you’d appreciate if they threw in a bit extra to cover the costs for the groom.

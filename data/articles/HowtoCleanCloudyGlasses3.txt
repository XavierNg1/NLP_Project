 The microfiber cloth that may have come with your glasses is ideal for cleaning your lenses, but even this can become dirty over time. Using a cloth that has dust on it will cause your lenses to develop small pits and scratches over time, creating cloudiness. To avoid this, only clean your glasses with a clean, soft cloth., The more dust and grime that is on your lens cleaning cloth, the more damage you will do to your lenses over time. Every time you dry, wipe, or polish your lenses, you will be scraping these particles against your glasses.


To keep your lens cloth cleanest, you may want to hold it in a glasses case that you carry with you throughout the day. You might also put this cloth in a plastic baggie or other container and tuck it away in a backpack or satchel.
 Depending on the cloth your are using, cleaning procedure can vary. A soft cotton piece of fabric can be washed normally, but you should follow the directions that came with your cloth. For cleaning a microfiber cloth, you should:


Separate it with like-fabric items.
Add a small amount of liquid detergent to your washing machine. Do not use fabric softener â€” this remains on the cloth and can leave streaks when using it on lenses.
Set your washing machine to cold.
Insert your microfiber cloth and like-cloth items into the wash.
Air dry or use a dryer on a low/no-heat setting., Over the course of a day your glasses will normally collect dust, dirt, and oil from your face and hands. By cleaning your lenses regularly with glass cleaner or warm water and a drop of dish soap, you can cut down on the overall daily cloudiness you may experience.
 This will keep dust from settling on the glasses and protect them from harm if they are knocked over. Instead of placing your glasses on your bedside table at night, for instance, place them in their case and then put that on your bedside table. This will also protect your glasses from getting broken or damaged if you knock them over when not in use.

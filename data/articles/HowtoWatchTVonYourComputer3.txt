 A TV tuner allows you to connect your antenna or cable box to your computer, and then play the video and change the channel using onscreen controls. Many TV tuners allow you to also record footage and save it to watch later, much like a DVR. An external USB TV tuner is much simpler to install than a TV tuner card, and is just as powerful.


You can find TV tuners at most major electronics retailers or through online outlets such as Amazon and Newegg.
You can also install a TV tuner card into a spare PCI slot on your computer, though this is fairly difficult compared to plugging in a USB tuner. See this guide for details on installing PCI cards.
 Connect the tuner directly to a USB port on your computer, or use a USB extension cable if the ports are too tight. Avoid plugging the tuner into a USB hub, as they usually don't allow it to draw enough power.
 Some tuners come with an antenna built-in. Your cable box or external antenna can be connected using the coaxial connector on the tuner.


If you wish to keep your cable box connected to your TV, but also want to connect it to your computer, you will need a coaxial cable splitter


, Some tuners allow you to connect an external A/V source, such as a DVD player, to your TV tuner. This allows you to turn your computer into an all-in-one entertainment center.
 If necessary, you may need to install the software that came packaged with the tuner. Most tuners come with the software on the disc, though you can usually download the software as well from the manufacturer's support page.


Windows Media Center supports TV tuners as well.
 Start the TV tuner software and follow the instructions to scan for available channels. If you are using an antenna, the channels you receive will depend on the signal strength., Many tuners allow you to record what you are watching to your computer hard drive. This can take a lot of space, but allows you to watch your shows again whenever you want.

 (Sims do not necessarily need to be in a relationship to try for baby. As long as their relationship bar is high, the option will show.);
,, No need for "woohoo".Â If successful, you will hear the lullaby sound.


The only times this method might not work is when your Sim is in a bad mood or when one of them is about to age. If one of your Sims is in a bad mood, have your other Sim try for baby instead. As for the aging problem, just age the Sim and go back to trying for baby. (It doesn't matter how old the male Sim is; they can still try for baby if the female is a young adult or full adult.)

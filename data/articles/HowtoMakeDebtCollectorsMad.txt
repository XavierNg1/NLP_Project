 The more you know what the collection agencies can’t do, the better you protect yourself.;
, They hate having to do anything that doesn’t involve them getting your money. And a collector, who’s trying to scam you into paying a debt you don’t owe, hates it when you don’t just give them your money.
 Here, you make sure the creditor/collection agency has the legal right to collect the debt rather than asking the creditor/collection agency if you actually owe the debt.
 Since the debt collectors want to get as much money from you as they can, and since the average person isn’t trained in negotiation like a lawyer, they figure they can get more money from you if you aren’t represented.
 If the court finds them guilty of violating the FDCPA, the collector will be fined $1000 per violation and may have to pay your attorney fees and court costs.
 Wouldn’t that make them happy?” Sometimes yes. However if you’re sure you owe the debt, and you pay on the debt, nothing will make a collector madder. They want to be able to continue being able to add interest, late fees, and penalties to your account. If you pay off the account, they lose the chance to make more of a profit. So do everything you can to pay off the debt as soon as you can.

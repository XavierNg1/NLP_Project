 It's far better than driving to the store, parking half a mile away, walking deep into the aisles, and wasting the time of a clerk who can't find it.;
,, When you knock something down from a rack or shelf, pick it up and put it back!


On the other hand, don't put things back yourself if you don't know where they go. "Helpfully" putting back a shirt you just tried on in the wrong section or with the wrong sizes can make the item harder for others to find, and harder for the salespeople to find again and put back properly. If in doubt, leave it to the professionals.
 Sighing, groaning, and inappropriate language won't make it move any faster.
 Having someone run a price check over insignificant amounts isn't worth your time, the clerk's, or that of the people behind you.
 When in doubt, either ask and/or study the owner's manual, and allow a few days' learning curve.
,, Odds are, they are neither - they are either having a bad day, or don't know the answer to your question.
 If you do, don't be mad when you are redirected, or sneered at by other customers.
 If the light is on, it's open - even if there is no cashier there. If it's off, it's closed, even if there are three cashiers there. Period. Entering a closed checkout is like telling the cashier you don't respect him/her to his/her face. Don't do it, no matter what. Even if there is only one light on with 20 people waiting to check out, don't do it.

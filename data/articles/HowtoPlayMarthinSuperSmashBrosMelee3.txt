 When being knocked away, side-B will give Marth a bit of time to stay in the air. When you are close enough to the side of the stage, then press Up-B. If you are close enough to the side of the stage and your enemy is trying to "Hedgehog," the attack will sometimes hit him. You can even side-B more than once if you time it correctly, allowing you to cover vast distances to make difficult recoveries.
 Down-B is used as a counter, and is one of Marth's most helpful attacks. Use it when you are being barraged by attacks and cannot escape. You will take no damage from that attack, and then use a sword strike to knock away enemies.


Avoid countering repeatedly, as most players will catch on quickly and fake you out, leaving you open.
 This is done by delaying the timing of Dolphin Blade (Up-B) so that you grab the ledge as late as possible, making yourself less vulnerable as you recover. This can be countered by edge-hogging though, so be careful.

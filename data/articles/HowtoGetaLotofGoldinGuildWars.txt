 When you hear people talk about Farming they are talking about hunting for a weapon or something. If you want gold just go outside any town and kill every thing in the zone if your kinda new maybe take a henchie ( i suggest only taking the healer ) and then once every thing is dead make sure you pick up all the loot and then go back to the starting town sell every thing besides dyes and wands, swords, shields,etc that were better then what you started with. Consider getting salvage kits or ID kits.

 You can still wear heels for casual chic, but flats are a more comfortable option that can still boast a lot of style. Some shoes to try include:


A pair of black-heeled pumps.
A pair of beige ankle booties
A pair of strappy sandals in a color of your choice
A pair of brown leather or suede boots.
A pair of nice sneakers or Converse high-tops.
 Casual chic enables you to combine the most comfortable clothes from your wardrobe and do a little mix-and-match with accessories. The best accessories include simple everyday items such as sunglasses, hats, scarves, belts, and purses/bags/totes. Some suggestions include:


1-2 scarfs in semi neutrals, i.e. blue,burgundy.
A oversized black leather handbag
A cream envelope clutch
A pair of golden framed mirrored aviator sunglasses, or a pair of regular large black sunglasses.
 You can also take jewelry, even basic rings, bracelets, and necklaces, and use them to give subtle accents to your outfit. Casual chic doesn't need to look expensive, so don't worry about getting a $350 necklace to look good.
 The beauty of casual chic is that you don't have to put hours of work into a hairstyle. Take care of your hair with daily conditioner and regular washing – this should be enough. Try putting your hair in a sleek ponytail, half up, in a loose bun – or just leave it down. You can keep it straight, curly, or wavy, but make sure that it isn't frizzy.
 If you are going to look casual, your makeup needs to be casual as well. Use tinted moisturizer or light coverage foundation to make your skin look dewy/glowing. Apply light foundation, a little bit of powder (if you need it), bronzer, white shimmer (to put in the corner of your eyes and to highlight the brow bone), and a touch of mascara.


Again, you don't need to go overboard. Simply touch up your facial skin and elongate your eyelashes a bit to look casual but put-together.

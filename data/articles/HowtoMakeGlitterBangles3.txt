 Use a glue gun if wished. Alternately, use glue in a tube and carefully add the glue around it, evenly.
 Roll the bangle through the glitter on the saucers. If you want the bangle to have different colors, only roll some of the way and leave some glue free to pick up a different color on another part of the bangle.
 Re roll making sure the bangle is covered properly. Or, use this second roll to add a different glitter color to the bangle. Shake off any excess again.
 Wash the glitter off your hands and vacuum up.
 This will seal the glitter to prevent it from wearing off your bangle.
 Wear with your favorite clothing.

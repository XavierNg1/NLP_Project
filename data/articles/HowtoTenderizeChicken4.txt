 It is difficult to judge the quality of chicken just by looking at the meat, so the best thing to do is buy your chicken from a reliable source. The store brand may or may not be as reliable as a nationwide brand name. The organic poultry farmer may or may not provide a more tender chicken, although if bought at a farmer's market he or she may be able to guide you to a good choice., In the United States, meat chickens are processed at only a few weeks old to ensure tender flesh. However, it is possible to cook older "stew hens" such as found on hobby farms or backyard coops. As the term suggests, stewing the meat is the suggested cooking technique, as the older flesh tends to be tougher.
 Dark meat chicken contains more fat, and therefore can be rendered more moist and tender in dishes that work well with dark meat. Breast meat and other white meat tends to be a little tougher. However, if you use a good buttermilk marinade or a meat tenderizer, it can still turn out quite tender.

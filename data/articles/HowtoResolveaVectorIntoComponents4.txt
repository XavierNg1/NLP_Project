 A vector is a mathematical tool that is used in physics to represent the way forces act on an object. A vector is said to represent two elements of the force, its direction and its magnitude.For example, for any moving object, you can describe its movement by giving the direction of its travel and its speed. You might say a plane is moving, for example, in a northwest direction at 500 mph (800 km/h). Northwest is the direction, and 500 mph (800 km/h) is the magnitude.

A dog being held on a leash experiences a vector force. The leash, when held by the owner, is being pulled diagonally upward with some measure of force. The angle of the diagonal is the direction of the vector, and the strength of the force is the magnitude.
 When you draw a vector, either using a precisely drawn representation on graph paper or just a rough sketch, certain geometrical terms are used.A vector is represented graphically by a ray{\displaystyle {\text{ray}}}. A ray, in geometry, is a line segment that begins at one point and, theoretically, continues infinitely in some direction. A ray is drawn by marking a point, then a line segment of appropriate length, and marking an arrowhead at the opposite end of the line segment. 

The tail{\displaystyle {\text{tail}}} of a vector is its starting point. Geometrically, this is the endpoint of the ray.

The head{\displaystyle {\text{head}}} of a vector is the position of the arrowhead. The one key difference between a geometric ray and a vector is that, in geometry, the arrowhead of the ray represents theoretical travel of infinite distance in the given direction. A vector, however, uses the arrowhead to indicate direction, but the length of the vector ends at the tip of the line segment, to measure its magnitude. In other words, if you sketch a ray in geometry, the length is irrelevant. If you draw a vector, however, the length is very important.
 Component parts of a vector rely on the trigonometry of right triangles. Any diagonal line segment can become the hypotenuse of a right triangle by sketching a horizontal line from one end and a vertical line from the other end. When those two lines meet, you will have defined a right triangle.The reference angle is the angle that is made by measuring from the horizontal base of the right triangle to the hypotenuse.

The sine of the reference angle can be determined by dividing the length of the opposite leg by the length of the hypotenuse.

The cosine of the reference angle can be determined by dividing the length of the base of the triangle (or the adjacent leg) by the length of the hypotenuse.

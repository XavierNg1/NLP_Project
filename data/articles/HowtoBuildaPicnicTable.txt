 The project in the photos uses pressure treated southern yellow pine, recycled from an old deck. Choosing premium lumber, or even a synthetic material made from recycled plastics will afford a higher quality finished project. The table built for this article is 72 inches (183 cm) long, 32 inches (81,3 cm) wide, and 32 inches (81,3 cm) tall, and required the following materials:









14 - 2x6 72 inches (183 cm) long.
5 - 2X4 30 inches (76,2 cm) long.
3 lbs. 12d (3 1/2 inch) hot dipped galvanized nails. (Substitute 3 1/2 inch exterior (deck) screws for greater strength);
, 6 til boardplate. 2 til seat rails. 4 til sitteplate.
Cut 3 2X4 boards, 30 inches (76,2 cm) from long point to long point, with 45 degree angles on each end.
Cut 4 2X6 boards 35 inches (88,9 cm) long from long point to short point, with a 25 degree angle on each end. Til bein.

Note that you will also have to cut the diagonal bracing underneath the table top, but it is best to scribe this board to fit after the rest of the top is fastened together.
, Toenail these to hold them in position until the table is flipped over, when you can finish nailing the top.
, Drive a nail into the leg at this mark, halfway to the head. This will support the seat rails, which you will install next.
 Nail these through into the legs.
 Scribe a 2X4 to fit diagonally between these marks, as shown in the photo. Cut these, and nail them securely into place.
 Lay your seat boards (again, 2X6s, 72 inches - 183 cm - long, on the seat rails that should be sticking out from beneath the table on each side. You will want to try them out for size, shifting them in or out along the rail until they are comfortable for you. When you have these rails in a desirable position, mark the location of the outer seat board, remove them, and saw a 45 degree angle on the rail so none of it will protrude from beneath the seats.
 Drive nails through the table top boards into their rails to finish securing them.
, You can use a silicone waterproofing sealer, an exterior polyurethane (many so-called polyurethane products actually degrade in ultraviolet light), or a semitransparent exterior wood stain for this purpose.

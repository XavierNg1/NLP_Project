 Put the bottom tip of the bow on the top of your foot and hold the top of the bow with your hand. Use your other hand to push out the center of the bow a few inches. Observe where the bow bends and where it does not.
 Using a knife, cut off wood from the inside of the bow where it does not bend. By removing wood, you will increase the flexibility of the stiff areas. Keep testing the flexibility of the bow until it bends in a uniform shape, both above and below the handhold.


Only cut wood from the inside. Leave the outside of the bow untouched.
The handhold and tips should remain relatively straight compared to the rest of the bow.
The amount of carving required will vary greatly depending on how thick the stave is.

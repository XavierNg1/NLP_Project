 Ideally, pick them after the morning dew has dried but before the sun has dried out the volatile oils that make basil taste so great.
 Dry before using.
 A lidded jar is a good option, such as a mason jar or a jar with a clip-on lid.
 Be sure to cover the basil.
 Set aside for 4 weeks in a cool, dark place.
 Add to various recipes that call for vinegar, such as pickling, salad dressings and savory dishes.


Strain any leaves out when using and discard them. Their flavor will now be imparted to the vinegar.

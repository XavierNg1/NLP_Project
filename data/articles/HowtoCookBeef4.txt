 A general rule with slow cooking is to cook a cut that is too tough to be grilled or cooked on a stovetop. Most of these cuts tend to be cheaper and often come in larger portions. The more popular slow cooking cuts are brisket and chuck pot roasts. Braised and slow cooked meats also keep and reheat well, so don’t be worried about purchasing more than you can eat in one sitting.Ask your butcher for slow cooking beef recommendations. Some other popular cuts are beef shoulder, short ribs, and bottom round steaks., Preheat your oven to 325F and let it cycle for around 45 minutes. Cycling will give your oven a consistent temperature. You want a relatively low temperature so that the fat and sinew in the beef can breakdown and become tender., Slow cooking can also call for using other spices, herbs, and liquids than are normally used when grilling or searing. A classic combination when braising beef is to use salt and pepper, fresh rosemary, thyme, and sage, and a little red wine and beef stock. Place these ingredients in a high walled pot, preferably a dutch oven. If you don’t have a dutch oven or a high-walled pot with a lid, you can purchase cheap aluminum roasting pans from most supermarkets., The only draw back about braising and slow cooking is in its name, its slow. However, the one benefit to slow cooking is that you don’t have to worry about over cooking the meat. Instead, let the beef cook for around 3 hours, checking on it occasionally. Press the prongs of a fork into the meat and gently pull. If the meat is fork tender the beef should be able to fall apart with minimal effort. If the meat is still tough, leave it to cook for another hour or so.,

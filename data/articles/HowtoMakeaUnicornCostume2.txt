 Create a unicorn costume with a tank top, headband and a tulle skirt. Repurpose an old tank top in a bright or pastel color. Buy about 2 yards of tulle in a preferred color. Youâ€™ll also need a length of elastic to go around your waist, a headband, rhinestones, and a glue gun., Assemble rhinestones on your tank top along the neckline and extending downward in a V pattern. Use a hot glue gun to attach the rhinestones to the tank top.
 Measure a piece of elastic to fit around your waist comfortably. Sew the two ends together so that it makes a circle. Cut lengths of tulle that will be twice as long as your desired skirt length.


Fold each strip of tulle in half. Tie these strips onto the elastic circle. The more strips you add to the elastic, the fuller and fluffier the skirt will be.
 Cut a large triangle out of felt. Wrap it into a cone shape and glue the cone closed. Attach this cone to a headband using a hot glue gun.


You can also use a cone-shaped piece of foam, available from a craft supply store. Wrap tulle around the cone and glue in place with the hot glue gun., Wear some gold leggings and sandals to complete your outfit. Paint your nails to match your outfit.

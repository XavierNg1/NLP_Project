 A smaller boat shouldn’t require much time to inspect, while a larger craft could take hours. There are several trouble spots you should be mindful of as you look it over:


Making sure the boat engine is in working order if you’re purchasing a motorboat.
Checking the bilge to ensure that it isn’t full of water, which can collect during storms. The owner may include a manual or automatic bilge pump with the boat.
Ensuring that the steering and throttle are fully functional.
Having the electrical components checked to make sure they are working as they should.
Inspecting the hull and siding and looking for any wear, damage or other problems (this should be done out of water.)
Confirming that the propeller and propeller shaft work properly.
Making sure the rigging, hardware, and sails are functioning well if you’re buying a sailboat.
 Some of the above concerns may only be addressed through a trial run. Most reputable boat sellers will allow for this, as it can only enhance the odds of making a successful sale. Be sure to address each of your concerns individually. For example, check the steering by making left and right turns, or adjust the motor to different speeds to ensure that it is working properly.
 If you’re satisfied with what you see, you should either agree to pay the listed price or take your chances at negotiating for a lower one. Some sellers are firm in their valuation (and will often say so in their ads), but many are willing to at least entertain an offer. It is ultimately the seller’s decision.
 Don’t be afraid to ask for help preparing the boat for transport if you have arranged to do so yourself. The chances are promising that the seller will be in a good mood, having unloaded a major burden. Double check to make sure the boat is completely secure before leaving the premises.

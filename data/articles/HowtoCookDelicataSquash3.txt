 Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin of the squash and a sharp knife to cut the squash into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes.

After peeling the squash, cut it in half lengthwise using a serrated knife.
Remove the seeds and fibers inside with a metal spoon or melon-baller.
Cut each half into cubes using the same knife. You could also cut the squash into slices by diving each half into four parts, cutting in an "x" pattern from each top corner to the opposite bottom corners.
 Allow the water to reach a rolling boil.

Do not use too much water, since the water level needs to remain fairly low. Only the steam is needed to cook the squash, not the water itself.
 The squash is done once it can be easily pierced with a fork. For cubed delicata squash, this should take 7 to 10 minutes.

Slices of delicata squash will need to cook for 12 to 15 minutes.
Cover the pan and reduce the temperature to low or medium-low as the squash cooks. The water should be at a simmer rather than a rolling boil.
 Remove the squash from the heat and cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

 Use a light sweeping motion over the soot once or twice to loosen and brush up surface particles. Do not rub the brush against the wood coarsely, since brush attachments can work soot further into the wood. You should also avoid using the brush against unfinished wood, since it is too easy to work soot further into the exposed grains.


This can be done either before or after using a dry chemical sponge, but it may be most effective if done before you use the sponge.
 Use a cream restoration polish for best results. Apply the cream to the wood and allow it to sit for approximately five minutes. Do not allow it to remain on the wood past ten minutes, since it may actually cause permanent damage to wood if it sits too long.
 Scrub the cream-covered soot stain with #0000 steel wool, following the grain of the wood to preserve the appearance of the finish. Going against the grain will likely cause the wood to lose its sheen.
 Use a soft terrycloth or microfiber towel to remove any remnants of the cream. All of the polish must be removed, or else you may inadvertently damage the look and integrity of the wood.

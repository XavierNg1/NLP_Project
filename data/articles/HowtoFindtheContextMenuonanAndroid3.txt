 Open the App Drawer located at the bottom right of the main screen. Scroll through the app list and choose the app you wish to open. Tap to open.
 Since some apps, such as Twitter, utilize many different methods, they may also add alternate context menus to use different functions of the app. Long press on the text, picture, or buttons in an app; do this in order to open an alternate context menu.


These menus can be anything from a simple “Copy & Paste” menu for text-based context menus, or they can bring up some sharing options in some photo apps. It all depends on what the app is being used for.

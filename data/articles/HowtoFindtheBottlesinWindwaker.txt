 The first bottle will come from a girl named Medii. She will ask for your help and eventually instruct you to toss her on an opposite ledge. After doing so, she will reward you with the bottle. This bottle is required to finish the game.;
, You will be able to travel to this island once you are able to sail. Once you land, look for a man named Ho Ho and investigate what he is looking at in his telescope. It’s a submarine! Sail your way to the submarine and fight your way to obtain the bottle.
 The third bottle comes with a cost! For 500 rupees, you will be able to buy the third bottle inside Beedle’s ship. Of course, this requires your ability to sail to reach this ship.
 This can only be done during nighttime. First, you need to find a girl named Mila but she will run away from you. Chase her but be careful not to be too close or she will spot you! Once she arrives at Zunari’s safe is when you can talk to her. You will be asked a series of questions. Always select the first option and she will give you the last bottle.

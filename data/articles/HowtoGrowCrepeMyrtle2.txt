 Apply 3 to 5 inches (7.6 to 12.7 cm) of wood mulch around the tree to help retain moisture and to discourage the growth of nutrient-robbing weeds. Keep a little space in between the trunk of the tree and the mulch, though, to prevent the trunk from rotting.


Reapply at least 2 inches (5 cm) of mulch each spring., The tree should be thoroughly drenched immediately after planting. Young crepe myrtle should be watered at least once a week during dormancy and five times a week during hot weather. This water regiment should continue for the first two months. Afterward, only water during periods of drought.
 Use a slow-release fertilizer that is high in nitrogen and apply it during the early spring, once leaves develop. A second fertilization is optional and can be done two months after the first, using the same type of fertilizer.
 Since the plant bloom on new growth, pruning the plant during winter, before new growth begins, will ensure that summer blooming will not be negatively impacted. Only light pruning is necessary.Remove basal shoots (buds that grow at the base of the tree), twiggy growth, intertwining branches, and branches growing inward toward the center of the plant.
Cut away side branches along the bottom 4 to 5 feet (1.22 to 1.52 meters) of the tree, exposing the trunk.
Snip off dead or dying flowers throughout the growing season to encourage a second blooming.
 Crepe myrtle is commonly affected by several diseases.Black mold appears as a sooty black coating on the leaves of the tree. It grows on the sticky dew left behind by aphids and similar pests. Get rid of the aphids with an insecticidal soap, and the mold should disappear.
Powdery mildew is a fungus that develops on leaves and flower buds. It can be prevented and treated by spraying the tree with a fungicide.
Leaf spot appears in the form of dark brown spots on the leaves of the tree. The affected leaves then yellow and drop. Leaf spot is another fungus and can be treated with a fungicide.

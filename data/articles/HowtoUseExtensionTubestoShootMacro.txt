 An extension tube creates more distance between your lens and the image plane in the camera, which will let you get closer to a smaller subject and thereby fill more of the image frame with a sharply focused subject. A "macro shot" is defined when an image is bigger than the original subject is.;
, You may instead attach the tube to the lens before attaching the joined components to the body.
,, Semi-automatic exposure programs (such as aperture priority) may not work well. The extension tube can affect the exposure sensor.
 Macro photographs have much less depth of field (near-to-far range of sharpness) than non-macro images.

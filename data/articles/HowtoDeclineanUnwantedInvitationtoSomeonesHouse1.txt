 Saying "Johnny had a cold last week" or "My gout has really been bothering me lately" or "Sorry! Can't do lunch. Kassie is allergic to gluten!" or "Hard pregnancy! I have random morning sickness" won't impress anyone. In some cases, it'll cause the person to try hard to accommodate your sickness. Blaming your inability to turn up on sickness usually backfires, for example:


Allergies: These can be catered for simply.
Current illness: A simple date shift will mean you still have to turn up.
Blaming it on aches and pains is silly! They will suggest a non-active activity!
Blaming it on sickness is unwise! They might say that they aren't overly freaked out about germs.;
, It's wrong and it'll unravel just when you least expect it.
 Anything involving your busy life, your children, your spouse, your work and so forth can all be explained away some way or other. Some people can be very accommodating or persistent and you can really hurt them by carrying on with excuses before finally putting down your foot and saying no.

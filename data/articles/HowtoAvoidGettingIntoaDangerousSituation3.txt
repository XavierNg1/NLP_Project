 Before you go out, make sure that you know how you will get home. Though a stranger may seem friendly and nice, appearances can be deceiving. You should not shy away from making new friends, but you should also exert caution when entering into potentially dangerous situations with new people, including entering a car with them alone.Never ride in a car when a drunk person is driving.
 Don't be afraid to draw attention to yourself - it may save you from harm. Also, should your attacker try to get you to go with them to another location, you should refuse. If they get you into a car with them and out of a public place, it is less likely that you will have a favorable outcome. Make as much noise as possible, fight, and call the police if possible. Do anything to get away from them.
 This holds true especially when an attacker is unarmed. Good places to aim for are the temple and the groin. It is unnecessary to make the moves fancy, so just remember that self defense is not pretty. Do whatever is practical and effective in keeping you safe.


One of the most effective ways to fight back is to use a palm heel strike. Your palm heel is the hard bone between your palm and your wrist. You can find it by pressing your palm hard on a flat surface: the area that turns white is the palm heel. Execute the palm heel strike by keeping your fingers back and thrusting your palm heel forward.
 Our psyche tends to tune us into issues even if there is no discernible danger in front of us. If you feel not at ease in a situation or at a certain place, leave that situation immediately or find a few friends to be with. It is better to be overly cautious and for nothing to happen than for danger to occur that you could have prevented.

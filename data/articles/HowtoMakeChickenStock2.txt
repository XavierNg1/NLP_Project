 This cut is usually really cheap, so it's a great choice if you don't want to pay for a whole chicken to roast. Chicken backs aren't always kept in view at the meat counter, so you might have to ask your butcher for some.
 Heat the oil in a large stockpot or dutch oven to medium high heat. When the oil is hot, put the chicken backs skin-side down in the oil. Sauté the chicken backs until the skin becomes brown and crispy. Turn them over and sauté the other side for a few minutes.
 Fill the stockpot with water so that it covers the chicken backs by about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Turn up the heat to high and bring the water to a rolling boil.
 Throw in the celery, carrots, onion, parsley and bay leaves. Turn the heat down so the stock comes to a steady simmer.
 Cook the stock at a simmer for about an hour, uncovered

, Place a strainer over a bowl and pour the stock through the strainer to remove the chicken backs and vegetables.
 If you wish, cover the bowl and put the stock in the refrigerator until it cools down. Skim off the fat layer with a spoon and discard.

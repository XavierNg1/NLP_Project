 No matter how hard you try,if you don`t know how to manage your time,then success is a far off thing for you. So better start managing your time efficiently;
, Make a list of the things required to do. Don't make your list an impossible thing to achieve by including everything to do in a single day.
 Talk to somebody with whom you are really close or ponder over the day you had. Were you able to complete the tasks? Or was Something left-out? If yes,then why? Soon by answering these questions you'll become efficient at accomplishing every single task in your list

, Changes are uncomfortable. And we humans have a tendency to avoid changes and ignore them as possible. But if you want to achieve something, you'll have to break the comfortable shell of yours. If you face failures in the beginning, don't let them discourage you. Try to try until you succeed

, Achieving success = stress. NO! You don't have to totally stop yourself from enjoying.Be your normal self, do things that you did previously but reduce the time limit of your enjoyment. Make your dreams your uttermost priority

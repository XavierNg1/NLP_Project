 It is better to avoid exposure to bacteria by letting the blister heal naturally without trying to pop it. If you feel like you must drain the blister read the medical warnings and instructions below.;
, One method is to simply soak the affected area. Use a clean bowl or sink and fill it with enough warm water to cover the area (your foot or hand, for example). Soak for 15 minutes. The warm water will soften the skin at the top of the blister, which can help the blister drain on its own., If your blister is in a spot that receives pressure, such as the bottom of the foot, you might want to cushion the area with a piece of moleskin. Moleskin is a soft cotton fabric, typically with an adhesive backing. This will relieve some discomfort. It can also help protect the blister.


Cut a piece of moleskin a little bigger than your blister. Cut away the center so that it fits around the blister like a donut. Stick this to the blister.
You can also try other adhesives like Blist-O-Ban and Elastikon.
 For most blisters, especially smaller ones, exposure to air will help the healing process. Give your blister some air. If the blister is on your foot, take care not to let dirt get on the blister.You may need to wait until bedtime before you uncover your blister. Let the affected area air out overnight while youâ€™re sleeping.

 Line a plastic tofu container with holes through the bottom with a piece of cheesecloth about four times the size of the box. Let the ends drape over the sides of the box.

You can use another loosely woven cotton cloth in place of cheesecloth.
If you don't have a special tofu box, you can poke holes in a different plastic container.
 Measure the liquid into a large cooking pot and heat it over low heat. It should stay at about 140 F., Put a cup of water in a clean bowl. Add 1/2 teaspoon of the nigari and mix until dissolved.

You can use gypsum as a coagulant instead of nigari; it results in a slightly softer tofu.
 Slowly add half the nigari mixture to the liquid in the pot. Stir constantly as you're combining the liquids. After 5 minutes, slowly add the other half of the nigari mixture, stirring constantly., Cover the pot, reduce to the lowest possible heat, and simmer for about 15 minutes. The mixture will begin to coagulate, and the curds will separate from the whey. When you see the white curds completely separate from the yellowish whey, it's time to transfer the tofu., Use a wooden spoon to scoop the tofu out of the pot into the lined tofu box. Pat it smooth and even. Wrap the excess cloth over the top. Place the lid on the container, then put a large pot of water on top of the container to serve as a weight. Let the container sit for 20 minutes to allow it to drain., Fill a large mixing bowl with cold water. Immerse the container of tofu in the bowl of water. Turn it over and gently remove the container. Remove the gauze. The solid block of tofu is now ready to eat.

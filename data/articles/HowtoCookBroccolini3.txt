 Fill a stockpot roughly two-thirds full with water and add a generous amount of salt. Heat on the stove over high heat.

Use roughly 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt for every 4 qt (4 L) of water.
 Add the broccolini to the boiling water and cook for no longer than 2 minutes.

Drain immediately when done. Pour the broccolini through a colander or remove it from the stockpot with tongs.
If you drag your feet on this step and let the vegetable stay in the hot water for too long, it will continue to cook and may become too tender or mushy.
 Transfer the broccolini to a large bowl filled with ice cold water to stop the cooking process.

Leave the broccolini in the ice water for about 2 minutes. As a general rule, blanched vegetables should be left in ice water for as long as they were left in boiling water in order to put a full stop to the cooking process.
 As the broccolini sits in the ice water, heat the skillet of oil over medium-high heat for a couple of minutes, or until the oil becomes thinner and easier to coat over the pan., Transfer the broccolini from the ice water and directly into the hot oil in the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes, or until warm and beginning to caramelize on the tips.Do not be alarmed if the broccolini sizzles once you place it in the pan. The violent sizzle results when water clinging to the vegetable touches the hot oil. If you want to minimize this reaction, quickly drain the wet broccolini on paper towels before placing it in the skillet.
 Transfer the broccolini to a serving platter and drizzle with lemon juice. Sprinkle with pepper, garlic powder, and additional salt, if desired, and enjoy.

 If you're going with slightly different colors, ask that everyone wear a similar style. This will help make the party look uniform, even if everyone is going with different shades or colors.For example, you can request everyone wear form-fitted dresses, longer dresses, or dresses with a particular neckline.
 A shared theme can help unify mismatched dresses. You can go with one overarching style theme to define your dresses. Think about the general theme of your wedding. If you're going for something vintage, for example, ask that people look for dresses with an old-fashioned cut or style. You could even take your bridesmaids on a trip to a vintage shop to pick out dresses.Many people prefer a similar color scheme as well as a unifying theme. Let your bridesmaids know if you want them to opt for dresses of a particular color.
 It can be fun to create some contrast with different prints and styles. You can have half the wedding party wear solid colors while having the other half wear prints. This will allow for some spontaneity on your big day. If you prefer a less rigidly uniform wedding party, mixing prints and solids is a great idea.You can still stick to one color scheme while mixing and matching. If your colors are gold and silver, for example, half the party can wear solid silver or gold dresses. The other half can wear patterned dresses that incorporate both silver and gold.
 Dresses of similar length look great together for photos. When choosing different styles of dresses, encourage everyone to keep the length the same. Let your bridesmaids know if you want floor length gowns, gowns cut above the knee, and so on.

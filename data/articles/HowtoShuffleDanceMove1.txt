 This is the beginning stance for the "T-Step.";
, Lift it about half a foot (15 cm) off the ground, by lifting your knee up and inward while your calf and foot extend away from your body. As you lift your right foot, your left foot should shuffle inward, so your toes are pointing inward instead of outward. This should happen at the same time as you lift your right foot.
 Point your right foot down and outward, just until your toes or ball of your foot touches the ground. This is a fast motion, so you don't have to firmly plant your foot on the ground. As you point your right foot back down, shuffle your left foot outward so that your toes are pointing outward.
 Practice combining the movements of your right foot and your left. Keep moving to the right, in the direction of your pointed foot, as you lift and lower your right foot while you shuffle your left foot inward and outward. Once you master this technique, your right foot should lift exactly when your left foot turns inward, and your right foot should point downward when your left foot turns outward.
 Once you've taken at least five steps to the right, you can switch to the left side. As your right foot hits the ground one last time, switch it to your "shuffling" foot, and begin to lift and lower your left foot as your right foot shuffles inward and outward to the left.
 After you've taken at least five steps to the left, switch back to the right, and keep on going until you've mastered the shuffle -- or if you just need a water break. Though the "T-Step" is all about the footwork, you can let your arms fall a bit away from your sides, moving in when your knee goes in, and moving out when your knee goes out.

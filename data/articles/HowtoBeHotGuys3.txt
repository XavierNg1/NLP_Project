 Common courtesies like holding the door for her and saying "thank you" will show her the kind of gentleman that you are. Remember that if she gives you a strange look after you use manners, it's probably because not as many people do that nowadays.
 You can talk about yourself, but keep it impressive and brief with just a touch of humility. Always turn the conversation back to her.
 Skip time-wasting activities and read a book or a newspaper every day. The more intelligent and well-informed you are, the more likely you are to impress a woman.
 You'll have to try different methods with women to see what works and what doesn't. However, if you never take your chances to proposition a woman, you'll always land on the best friend list instead of in her arms.
 When you recognize signals of attraction, make your move and get her alone as quickly as possible. She'll appreciate a man who's decisive and willing to move things along.

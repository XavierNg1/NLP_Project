 The frequency depends on your hair type, but every other day is a good rule of thumb. Shampoo strips your hair of essential oils that it needs to be healthy, so limit the amount that you use on your hair.


People with oily hair may need to shampoo more often, but still should not shampoo every single day.

How to Get Self Cleaning Hair will show you how to take advantage of your hairâ€™s natural cleaning methods.
 Use your fingers to stimulate the hair follicles on your head. You shouldn't be scrubbing or rubbing, just gently massaging.
 Conditioner applies essential oils to your hair that keep it healthy, shining, and amazing. Use a dry conditioner if you don't shower, or just rinse your head quickly and apply some conditioner.
 Heat is the enemy of amazing hair. When you shower, you should use cool or lukewarm water to ensure a healthy head of hair.
 Split ends are when individual hairs shear, breaking into several thin, damaged hairs. This break can travel all the way to the root, which will damage the hair follicle. Try to get your hair trimmed every six months to prevent split ends.

, Combing distributes oils and promotes strong hair. Try to comb your hair after a shower, but only once it has completely dried. Do not comb your hair when wet, as wet hair is more prone to breaking.
 Fruits, veggies, nuts, and seeds are key to healthy hair. You can also take supplements for your hair that usually include Vitamin D, but they shouldn't be necessary. Good foods to try include:


Proteins like tuna, eggs, and chicken.
Avocados, almonds, olive oil, and other unsaturated fats.
Drink 5-8 glasses of water a day.
 Coat your hair with warm coconut oil or olive oil. Leave the oil in your hair overnight, under a hair cap, once a week. Use shampoo and water to remove it in the morning.

 You can plant your sets as early as August, but many gardeners prefer to wait until October, when the weather has significantly cooled. You can even plant your sets in the early winter, as long as the ground has not become solid yet.;
, Winter onions are hardy enough to grow in a variety of conditions, but they prefer to soak in full sun.
 Use a rake or trowel to loosen the soil in your plot. Winter onions do best in loose, well-drained soil. Avoid using sandy soils, however, since sand causes soil to lose moisture a little too quickly, preventing your onions from soaking in all the nutrients they need to thrive.
 Sterilized compost is a popular choice. Organic matter provides additional nutrients and may improve the soil's ability to retain proper moisture levels.
 Gently push the set into the ground until it is just below soil level. Cover it with additional soil if necessary, gently packing the soil over the bulb.
 Each row should also be spaced about 1 foot (30 centimeters) apart.
 The mulch allows the soil to retain moisture longer and also keeps the onions a little warmer than they would be if the soil remained exposed.

 Get a GameShark for your GameBoy Advance system. These cartridges will let you enter in cheat codes that change the game. As these systems are no longer in production, your best bet for finding one will be Ebay or the Amazon marketplace.;
, Start up GameShark and navigate to Pokémon Emerald on the list of games, hit the right D-pad, and then select “Create New Code.”

, While the GameShark comes preloaded with many cheat codes, you'll need to enter specific codes for catching Missingno. Once you’ve pressed “Create New Code,” simply enter the text below, doing each line separately. When you have entered all lines, save and finish. Here are the two codes you'll need to plug into your GameShark (the first is the master code for any cheats to work and the second will allow your character to walk through walls and gates): Must Be On (Master Code)

, Once you have entered the codes, you'll need to activate them on the GameShark system. Navigate to Pokémon Emerald, then to the new codes you have entered, and turn them on with the A button. Now you are ready to start your game.
 Follow the instructions from the GameShark and plug in your Pokémon Emerald cartridge. Start up the game and load your save. Make sure you have Pokeballs with you. You should bring a few, just in case. Pokeballs can be purchased at any PokeMart.
 Once you are loaded in, head to a Pokémon Center. It doesn't matter which one. Go into the Link Cable room upstairs, and walk through the gate to go into the Link Cable Colosseum. Sit at one of the benches, and wait until an event occurs. This could take a few seconds to a minute or two. Once it occurs, you'll be thrown into a wild Pokémon battle.
 The battle should be with a level 0 Pokémon that has an empty health bar. Don't attack—simply throw Pokeballs at it in order to capture it. After you catch it, you'll unlock Missingno's Pokedex information and you can nickname the Pokemon. It will look like a Shiny Bulbasaur.


You can view the PokeDex entry in Section 5. Missingno's number is 000. Even though you have caught Missingo, you won't be able to battle with him. Any attempted fights with Missingno will cause you to lose immediately. All you can do is unlock his information in the PokeDex.

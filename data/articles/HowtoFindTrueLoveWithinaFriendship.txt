 If the person is in trouble, help them out. If the person is happy, be happy with them. If they are sad, be a shoulder to cry on.;
, If you're really good friends with the person, go into town to catch a coffee, invite them on walks, or just invite them to your house for a bit of a catch up. The possibilities are endless - just make sure you know them well enough to feel comfortable having deep conversations and sharing your world with them, you don't want them to be creeped out with your sudden eagerness and interest.
 If they're struggling in a subject at school, go over a few topics with them. If they're having a bit of crisis in work, let them confide in you, if they're having problems with family and friends give good, sensible advice. The bottom line is - be caring.
 Have opinion, express your views and be the real you.
 Always look them in the eye. As some say, the gateway to a person's soul, is through their eyes.
 Try to not have any arguments, even though they can easily happen, don't ever cheat and always look your best for them. Respect them, guys especially love respect.

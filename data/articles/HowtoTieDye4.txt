 The rosette pattern creates a series of small, overlapping circles that can be linked together in a variety of patterns. You'll create this pattern by gathering together several points along your fabric and tying them together., You might want an arc of rosettes beneath the top of your fabric, above its bottom hem, up and down its sides, or any number of other variations. When you've decided where you want your rosettes to be, use a piece of chalk to draw a dots along the fabric where the center of each rosette will be.You can even create more elaborate shapes with your rosettes. For example, you could make a circle of rosettes around the middle of your shirt or gather them into the shape of star. Your imagination is the limit!

, Using your thumb and pointer finger, pinch each point and draw it together with its neighbor. Use one hand to hold your gathered points together and your free hand to continue adding points. Continue doing this until all your points are gathered together., Wrap a string or rubber band about 2 inches (5 cm) below the topmost point, which should be where you first marked your dots. You'll want your rosettes fastened very tightly. This may require using more than one fastener., Hold your fabric just below where you have fastened your rosettes and, with your other hand, draw together the loose end and hold it firmly. Pull the fabric so it is tight and then use rubber bands or string to fasten it at regular intervals.

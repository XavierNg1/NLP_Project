 Updating the device drivers prior to attempting to format a CD-RW will often solve formatting issues.

Open the Control panel from the Start menu and double-click the Device Manager icon. The Device Manager folder containing a list of the devices installed on the computer will open on the desktop.






Locate the CD/DVD drive from the list of installed devices. Double-click the device and enter the user name and password if prompted. The device manager dialog box will open on the desktop.






Click on the driver tab and then click the Update Driver button located in the lower-left corner of the dialog box.






Follow the instructions as directed by the Driver Update Wizard and attempt to format the CD-RW once the drivers for the device have been updated. The device drivers for the CD/DVD drive have been updated using Windows Driver update feature.

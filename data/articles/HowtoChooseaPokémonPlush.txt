 If your favorite Pokémon is, say, Mantyke, then you will need to read up on it. A recommended source is Bulbapedia, an online Pokémon encyclopedia.;
, If you want to take your Pokémon everywhere with you, Poke Dolls are highly recommended. Or, if you want to keep it in your room,you may want a larger one, so you don't lose it as easily.
 Look up "xxxx plush" without the quotes and replace "xxxx" with your Pokémon. Keep in mind, though, that looking up Pikachu or Squirtle will have many results, while Qwilfish or Machop may not. If this happens, try another favorite Pokémon.
 You will, however, need a credit card to do so. If you are a kid or do not have your own credit card yet, then your parents will need to order it for you, as they will probably freak out at you if you use their credit card without permission.
 You can make a small bed for it, and make a menu with tasty foods for it to eat. Pokémon love Berries, so you can prepare pretend foods for it (Rawst Berry Crepes, Chesto Berry Salad, etc.) that contain Berries. Of course, it won't mind other foods at all, unless it's just plain gross., Wake it up in the morning with a hug and kiss, pack it lunch to eat at noon if you are at school, play with it after you come home, and have dinner and dessert at night! Do fun things with it related to its type like "diving" under the blankets if you have a Water-type, or, if you own a Fire-type, you could pretend hike at the edge of an active volcano!

 Use a bowl or a cup to bail standing water out of the sink. Pour the water into a bucket.
 Use a spatula to force the baking soda into the opening, if necessary.
 Put the stopper into the sink so that the vinegar is forced toward the clog.
 Run warm water into the sink to see if the clog disappears.
 If the sink is still clogged, then apply the baking soda and vinegar solution again.

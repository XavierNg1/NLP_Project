 The primary way to treat vitamin A toxicity is to remove the source of excess vitamin A from your cat’s diet. If caught early, most symptoms improve soon after switching to a more balanced diet of commercial cat food. Discuss your cat’s current diet and any necessary dietary changes with its vet.Most vets recommend switching cat food gradually by first mixing old and new food together. However, since vitamin A toxicity usually occurs in cats with liver-based diets, the vet will likely advise you eliminate liver and switch to a commercial cat food more abruptly.If you give your cat animal liver, liver-based treats, fish liver oil, or any supplements, stop doing so immediately.
 After switching its food, you’ll likely need to bring your cat back to the vet for a follow-up visit within one to two weeks. This will allow the vet to retest your cat’s vitamin A levels to ensure switching its diet was an effective treatment.Total costs of vitamin A toxicity treatment vary by location and severity of poisoning. In the United States, the average cost is $500., In rare cases, a vet might recommend removing new bone formations surgically. However, this procedure is only advised in cases of severe vitamin A toxicity.If your cat’s vet believes it’s a surgical candidate, they’ll inform you about risks, costs, and pre- and postoperative care.

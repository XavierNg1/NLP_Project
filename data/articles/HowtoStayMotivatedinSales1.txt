 Make new efforts to leave work at the office and work harder while you are there. The more you enjoy your spare time, the happier and more motivated you will be to achieve more at work.;
, There are commonly 2 problems groups, the people who talk negatively about work and the people who are just negative about everything in their life. If you are unsure of how to broach the subject of their unhealthy negativity, simply say, "I need to focus on work now, let's have drinks or lunch soon to catch up."


If your good friends are negative, then make sure to control their effect on you. One negative session is better than allowing people to visit your desk or email about their problems during the work day.
 Even if your job allows you to surf the Internet at your leisure, most of the Facebook posts are either distracting or sensational, draining your energy. You will have a harder time getting back on the phone, if you allow this to be your main interaction with other people during the day.
 Most everyone, and not just sales people, need to get their blood moving more than they do in an office environment. Take the stairs, walk around every 30 minutes to 1 hour and take a longer walk at lunch and you will have a fresh perspective when you return.
 Sales environments often encourage drinking as a stress-relief activity. However, you are more likely to become negative about work and feel tired and unmotivated the next day.


If a hangover is the most un-motivating addition to the workplace, then try to adopt activities that reduce poor mental and physical effects, like a good diet, exercise and time outdoors.

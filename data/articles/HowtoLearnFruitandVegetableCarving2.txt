 You will need a cutting board, a carving knife, and a washed medium-sized cucumber.Choose a cucumber that has smooth even skin and feels firm when you squeeze it.

If you want to make smaller leaves, you can either use smaller cucumbers or cut a large cucumber in half.
 First, cut one of the rounded ends off of the cucumber. This cut end will be the small end of the wedge. Next, diagonally slice the cucumber lengthwise, leaving the uncut rounded end as the thickest part.

Discard the removed cucumber parts or chop them up and add them to a salad.
 Lay the cucumber on your cutting board with the flat side against the board. Carefully cut away the sides of the cucumber to shape the top into a rounded point. Lastly, scoop out the seeds and soft flesh from the underside of the cucumber using a small, rounded spoon., Use the carving knife to cut two shallow parallel lines down the center of the leaf shape. Stop carving about one centimeter away from the tip of the leaf. Next, carve away a small amount of the green skin around your parallel lines . This will reveal the white flesh of the cucumber and create a green center vein.Carve away less than you think you need to. You can always carve green away, but you canâ€™t add it back.
 Remove the skin of the cucumber to create a leaf shape on the cucumber. Use the green center vein as a guide. The edges of the leaf should move away from the center vein in a jagged line.Cut the edge of the cucumber to match the edge of the leaf shape. Leave about a centimeter of green skin between the white leaf pattern and the edge of the cucumber.

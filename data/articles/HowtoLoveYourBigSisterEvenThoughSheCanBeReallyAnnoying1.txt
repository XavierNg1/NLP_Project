 Be sure to look at the relationship from her perspective as well, and not just yours. Remember that she has feelings as well. Consider the following:


Is our relationship strong or weak?
What are the positives of my relationship with her?
What are the negatives of my relationship with her?
What can be done to improve my relationship with her?
Have I done anything wrong in the past to hurt her deeply?

If so, could her hostile behavior towards me be a result of my mistake?

, What subject did those arguments mostly circle around? Were they petty or important fights? If you two fight frequently, you may want to try to lower the number!

, Has she been dealing with problems at school or outside of the family? If she has been, she probably is taking out her frustration on you - one of the few or many things she is able to pick on easily. If this is the situation you are looking at, remember that she has feelings just like you do, and she may actually going through a hard time.
 Siblings can easily get jealous of one another, and wish they had their siblings' successes or life. If that is the case, treat your older sister nicely, and bring everyone's attention to her excellent qualities and talents. Speak nicely of her, and make sure people know that she is a good person.


Be careful of who you tell your sister's qualities to, as this could end badly. It's best to tell your friends about how talented your sister is, so that they will look up to her.

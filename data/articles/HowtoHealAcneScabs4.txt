 Honey has been known for its antibacterial properties for centuries. However, most of the honey you find in the grocery store is loaded with additives. Raw honey is unprocessed and will heal your scabs more effectively. You can find raw honey at natural food stores, farmers' markets, and from local bee keepers., Do this after you've cleaned the affected area. Place the honey on your scabs using a light dabbing motion. Keep the honey on your scabs for at least two hours or overnight., Hydropolymer dressing covers leaking wounds in moist environments. Even if your scabs aren't leaking, the dressing will seal in the honey and prevent it from getting on your clothes or in your hair. You can usually find it at the drug store.If you can't find hydropolymer dressing, you can use regular adhesive bandages. However, the adhesive might lose its hold after a few hours., The following morning (or after two hours have passed), wash your skin with your usual cleanser and warm water. Use upward and outward circular strokes. When you're finished, blot your skin dry with a clean towel.

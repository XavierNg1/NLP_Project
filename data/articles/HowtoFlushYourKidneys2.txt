 Physical exercise can help you avoid weight gain and high blood pressure, both of which put unnecessary pressure on your kidneys. Keeping your body healthy can help your kidneys function properly. Aim to get at least 20 minutes of physical activity each day.Look for an activity that you enjoy. For example, if you like to walk, recruit a friend and schedule a standing date to explore your neighborhood. If you like to swim, look for a community pool in your area.
If you're new to exercise, consult your doctor before beginning any program.
 If you smoke, quitting can help improve not only your overall health, but it will greatly benefit your kidneys. Smoking impedes blood flow to vital organs, including your kidneys. This means that they cannot effectively flush toxins from your body.Quitting smoking is hard, but there are many resources you can use. Ask your doctor about medication or nicotine cessation products such as gum or patches.
 While there are many benefits to medications, there can also be side effects. Some prescription medications have been known to cause damage to the kidneys. Make sure to discuss this possibility whenever your doctor issues you a prescription.Over-the-counter pain killers — especially the NSAIDS such as ibuprofen, Aleve, and Motrin — can also cause damage to the kidneys if taken on a regular basis. They are fine for occasional use, but talk to your doctor about alternatives if you need to treat chronic pain and have concerns about your kidney health.Acetaminophen is a kidney-safe NSAID.

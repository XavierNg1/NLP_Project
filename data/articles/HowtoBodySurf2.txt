 Surfing of any kind requires a beach that has a noticeable surf break. This means that the water breaks, forming a surfable wave.


Choose the right waves. For beginners, it's best to start out small. Choose a beach with waves that are less than four feet high, and look for surf locations with gentle slopes. Know your breaks. Breaks are caused by a variety of factors, typically because of some underwater landscape change that causes the surface to rise up. While big waves can offer ideal opportunities for surfing, shore breaks can also create dangerous situations. Know the beach you plan to surf at and understand the potential hazards. , These reports, which are easily found online, can tell you vital information, such as wave heights and weather forecasts. Check the local weather listing and read updates from the coast guard, as well as from other surfers.
 If there is increased shark activity at a certain beach, you'll want to know about it in advance. Likewise if a storm has brought in new, potentially hazardous wood or rocks underwater. Doing research at home can save you from learning the hard way about a potentially dangerous situation.


Ask an expert. If you're unsure whether a beach is safe, and the online surf reports aren't up to date, call or email the lifeguard association in that region. They'll know which beaches have hazards like rip currents or shark sightings, and they may be able to recommend a safer alternative than the beach you're planning on surfing.

 If you're unsure about how to do this, look under Settings or Controls.
 If your computer does not have the hardware for a Bluetooth/Infrared this connection, then buy the adapter, sometimes called a 'dongle'. The common BT/I adapter plugs into a USB port. If you're on a budget, look for a used one online - they can be quite inexpensive. This adapter will have software for the connection process, which lets you transfer files from the computer to your phone, or vice versa.


Some computers, such as MacBooks, are already outfitted with Bluetooth devices, and won't require one of these cables. If you're unsure about whether or not your computer has this capability, search for the information online.



If you have a Mac, you can make sure your Bluetooth is on by clicking on the Bluetooth symbol on the right side of the upper toolbar. The symbol should be to the left of the Date and Time and should look like some triangles.
On a Vista, go to Control Panel -> Network and Internet Connection -> Bluetooth Devices.
 Bluetooth does not work more than 30 feet (9.1Â m) away.,,,,,,,,

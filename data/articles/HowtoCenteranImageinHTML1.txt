 In HTML coding, you can center text, but you must identify image alignment with the word “middle.” An image is not a line element, so it is identified in relation to other elements.;
, Use a paragraph tag to indicate that a text line is beginning. Start your tag with <p> then write your text.
 Then include your image description by typing alt=”image description”.


The “src” section tells the web page the URL of the image.
The alt section tells the web page what it should be called.
 Type align=”middle”> This is the end of the image portion of your tag., Then, close the tag with </p>. For example, your entire tag could look like this:
<p>We’re learning about HTML. <img src=”dancingdogpicture.gif” alt=”dancing dog” align=”middle> Our example is complete. </p>

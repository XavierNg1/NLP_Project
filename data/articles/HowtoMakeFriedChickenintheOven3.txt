 Put 8 skinless chicken drumsticks into a prep bowl and sprinkle the seasonings over them. Toss the drumsticks, so they're all coated with the seasonings. You'll need:1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika
1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

, Measure out 1 cup (240 ml) of buttermilk and pour it over the drumsticks. Squeeze half of a lemon and strain it into the bowl with the chicken. Put the bowl in the refrigerator and chill the chicken for 6 to 8 hours.You can refrigerate the chicken overnight, if you'd like to prepare it the night before you want to serve it.
 When you're ready to oven fry your chicken, turn the oven on to 400 degrees F (200 C). Get out a baking sheet and set a wire rack on it. Spray the rack and baking sheet with cooking spray., Get out a shallow prep bowl and measure 2/3 cup (60 g) of panko bread crumbs and 1/2 cup (15 g) of crushed cornflakes into it. Stir in the remaining coating ingredients until they're combined. You'll need to add:2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon chili powder

, Lift the drumsticks out of the buttermilk and lay each piece in the dry coating. Roll the drumsticks, so they're completely coated in the mixture.You may need to coat them in batches, if they don't all fit in the mixture at once.
 Set the coated drumsticks on the wire rack that's on the baking sheet. Take your cooking spray and spray each of the drumsticks with more cooking spray.This will make the drumsticks even crispier.
 Put the baking sheet in the oven and cook the drumsticks for 40 to 45 minutes. They should become crispy and turn golden brown. Remove the drumsticks from the oven and serve them immediately.You don't need to turn the drumsticks, since they're on the wire rack.

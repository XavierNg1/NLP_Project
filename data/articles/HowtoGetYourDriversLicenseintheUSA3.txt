 It served you well, but it's not needed now. They will issue you your first official driver's license. Congratulations! All your work paid off and you're now a licensed driver. You earned it with all your training and studying. But the process isn't quite over yet.


For persons under the age of 21, a distinctive “Under 21” license will be issued. The “Under 21” operator’s license is generally valid for ninety days beyond the 21st birthday.
 As a licensed driver, you'll be subject to your state's point system. A driver under the age of 18 is generally held to a higher standard, and if you get any points against you, you could have your driving privilege suspended, so drive safely.


All drivers under the age of 21 are subject to “Zero Alcohol Tolerance.” Yep, even one beer will wreak havoc on your driving record. Obligatory preachy part: Don't drink and drive, and avoid this issue altogether.
 It may have been a single incident (what do you mean you can't drive 60 in a school zone?) or it might have been a series of small mistakes, like driving over the curbs, doing a rolling stop at stop signs, knocking over all the cones during the parallel parking maneuver, or generally driving poorly. You should figure out what you need to work on before retesting.
 Yes, again. No, it's still not exciting. But you must know the rules that they expect you to follow during the test, or you will not pass next time, either. You should also continue to practice driving some more. If there was a specific problem during the driver's test, be sure to really focus on it.
 Practice during the required waiting period, then go back and do it again. Only this time, you're ready!

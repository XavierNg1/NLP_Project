By default, Google shows data worldwide, from 2004 to the present, at a monthly granularity. However, you can restrict to more recent time intervals. The granularity is determined based on the time interval. If looking at data for the past year, you will get a weekly granularity. For the past 90 or 30 days, you will get daily granularity. For the last 7 days, you will get hourly granularity. If looking at the past 24 hours or less, you will get even finer granularity, with the finest granularity of 1 minute obtained if looking just at the past hour.
Google scales the plot so that the largest data point plotted has the value 100. If plotting multiple keywords, it will look at the largest of the data points across all search terms included. This can create problems with looking at your data if there is an outlier. You might need to select your time range and collection of search terms to eliminate such outliers.
You can also drill down by region. Keep in mind that the times displayed are times in your local timezone and not the region you select.
 There are a number of keyword research tools, some of them available for free and others requiring a paid subscription. Paid services will generally do better on the long tail of items, whereas free services will usually be good enough for very popular queries.

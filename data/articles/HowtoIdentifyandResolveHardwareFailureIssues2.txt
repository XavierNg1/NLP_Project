 A faulty RAM can cause problems with a system. Some of the more common signs of a memory problem are stop errors of the system failing to start.
 This will attempt to resolve any errors on the hard disk, or problems with software configuration that may stop the computer from starting normally. If the computer still fails to start after this, launch the Windows Memory Diagnostic in Windows Boot Manager.
 Thus, you can schedule it to run the next time you start your computer. To do this, go to Control Panel, click on System and Security, and then on Administrative tools. Double click on Windows Memory Diagnostic, and then select the appropriate option.
 Type mdsched at the command prompt, or by clicking Start and typing mdssched.
 To access this, repeatedly press the space bar as the system starts.


Press Tab to select Windows Memory Diagnostic is also available through System Recovery Options.
 There are three levels of testing, Basic, Standard, and Extended.
 More passes takes longer, but it more likely to find any intermittent memory problems.

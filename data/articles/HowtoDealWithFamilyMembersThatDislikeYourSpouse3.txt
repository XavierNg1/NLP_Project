 Whether or not you see the problem in your spouse’s relationship with your family, be supportive of your partner and be sure to stand up for their feelings if you need to. You may need to put your marriage ahead of your family of origin, and your family should recognize the importance of the bond between you and your spouse.If you have a hard time understanding where your spouse is coming from, consider that they probably want to keep the peace just as much as you do. Most people understand that family is a sensitive topic and do not wish to rock the boat.
You might not see your spouse’s concerns as a big deal, but consider how you would want your spouse to react if the roles were reversed, and you had a problem with your spouse’s family. Show empathy towards your spouse.
 Let them know what to expect so as to avoid any surprises. Share your family’s background, jobs, personalities, or whatever information you think would be helpful to your partner.


Address any potential conflict points before your spouse and your family see each other. For example, “Uncle Bill loves to talk about gun rights. I know you don’t like guns, so if he brings it up, it’s okay to try to change the subject or walk away.”, Families are like little cultures all their own, and what might be acceptable in one family is not in another.Let your partner know how your family handles communication and conflict. Since you likely know both your spouse’s family and your family, you can compare the two and address differences.


For example, your spouse may be from a noisy family where you have to shout to be heard at the dinner table. Your family may be much quieter. Let your spouse know that yelling would be considered very rude to your family.

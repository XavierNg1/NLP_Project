 You don't always have to use your words to express appreciation. Sometimes, doing something nice for your parents is enough. Your parents value you, and want to spend time with you. Plan a fun day full of family activities.Take your parents to see a movie they would like.
Plan a family picnic.
Treat a parent to lunch.
Go to a local attraction, like a museum, with your parents and any siblings.
 The gift of time is often all your parents need to know you appreciate them. Do not wait until something has occurred to show appreciation. Do so regularly by spending time with your parents. Try to find a little time each week to visit your parents.If you don't live near home, try to find time to call each week. A quick phone call can really show your parents you care.
 If you're feeling grateful, try finding a present your parents would like. Presents don't have to only be given on holidays or special occasions. If you see something your mom would love at a local gift shop, don't hesitate to buy it. A surprise gift can really show that you care., Anything your parents dread doing (chore wise) make sure and do! This will take many sacrifices. If you live at home, you can show appreciation by chipping in regarding household chores. In addition to doing any chores expected of you, do a little extra now and then. For example, do the dishes when your mom has had a busy day at work. Take the trash out when you see your dad has forgotten to do so., Do it secretly, so they won't try to chime in and help you. Breakfast in bed will probably be the easiest meal. Don't wake them up though!

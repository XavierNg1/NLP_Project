 While not completely necessary, this step makes your tofu easier to separate into portions after you freeze it. Chop the tofu, dice it, or break it into pieces., The freezer chamber should be relatively devoid of bacteria, but it's still a good idea to keep the tofu sealed in an airtight container for the sake of preservation.
 Keep the tofu for at least 24 hours to achieve the fullest firming effect. If you are in a time crunch, feel free to cut short of 24 hours. Any freezing should help.

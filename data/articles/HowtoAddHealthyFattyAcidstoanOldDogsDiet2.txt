 In order to maintain the health of its skin and coat, your dog will need to have a diet that includes omega-6 fatty acids. These fatty acids can be found in pork fat, chicken fat, as well as safflower, sunflower, corn and soybean oils. However, you should limit your dog’s ingestion of tallow and lard, which contain omega-6 fatty acids, because they can cause your dog to get overweight.Most commercial dog foods are already high in omega-6 fatty acids.
 As your dog ages, its coat and skin may be less healthy. This is often the result of diminished liver function and a decrease in the production of GLA. If your dog’s coat is patchy, you may want to talk to your veterinarian about a GLA supplement for your dog.There are a number of over-the-counter supplements that contain GLA. Be sure to talk with your veterinarian before giving any supplement to your dog.
Your veterinarian should be able to provide you with GLA. You can also find it at most pet stores.
 If your veterinarian recommends a GLA supplement for your dog, you will need to find a way to administer it. Many dogs do not like swallowing pills, so you may need to hide it or mix it up in your dog’s food. You can also disguise the pill inside a treat, such as cheese or peanut butter, and feed it to your dog.


You can buy most supplements over-the-counter. However, you should talk to your veterinarian before giving your dog any medication.
You can find these supplements at your local pet store.

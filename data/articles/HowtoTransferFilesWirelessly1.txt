 Bluetooth is a wireless technology that can be used for transferring files between two or more devices that support this technology.To transfer by Bluetooth, both, the sending device and the receiving device should have Bluetooth support.

Enable Bluetooth on both the devices. Choose the files you want to send (on the sending device) and transfer them.

Some devices require a security key or a PIN number before the transfer takes place. Enter the same security key or PIN number on both the devices.

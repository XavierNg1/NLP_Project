 Because they feed at night, you may not see the caterpillars right away. Brown spots on your lawn are often the first sign that you have an armyworm problem. An increase of the number of birds in your yard may be an indication of armyworms. The earlier you treat the problem, the easier it is to control and less damage a lawn will sustain., Trimming your grass short is perhaps the best way to discourage the presence of armyworms. Consider mowing your lawn a bit shorter than you normally would, and keep it groomed., Watering your grass, especially when done right after mowing, also causes caterpillars to move on to other lawns. Develop a regular watering routine, and remember to also water your grass right after mowing., Spraying the grass with a liquid insecticide is a very effective way to eradicate armyworms. Granular insecticides are generally less effective against armyworms. Choose a liquid insecticide, and follow all manufacturer's instructions (as these can vary from product to product)., After you apply liquid insecticide to your lawn, it is important to avoid mowing and watering for at least three days. This gives the insecticide time to work.

 Part time and summer jobs can be a great way to earn some cash to buy a cheap beginner car. These jobs include: mowing lawns in your neighborhood, raking leaves/ shoveling snow. house sitting, baby sitting, dog sitting/walking are all great opportunities to make some extra cash to have some spending money as well as money to put back towards a car.
 When saving for a car, question every purchase and make sure it isn't a waste of money. It is recommended to start saving around the age of 13 if you have a part time job, or even just get paid to do chores. Instead of spending your allowance, try putting it into a piggy bank or a bank account that you won't touch., Keep a ledger (money log) to make sure you know where all your money is being earned and spent at. This will help you stay motivated to keep saving more money. the more you save the better car you can get (keep in mind that you need a reserve amount of money for gas, insurance, and maintenance on the vehicle.)

 The internet is a great source for pictures. Websites like polyvore are great, and you can always visit online shopping sites and print off photos of products. Google search is another good way to find online photos. Try using keywords like "Fashion Fall 2014", with the season and year for current styles, or indicate your age and personal style, for example, "Teen girl preppy style". Put all the photos you choose onto a word or google docs file and print them off. Alternatively, cut out photos from magazines.;
, If you want your collage to be permanent, try either cardstock or cardboard. Craft paper (The heavy brown paper that's trendy right now) also looks great. Experiment with patterns.Â If you want your collage to be temporary, pick up a cheap corkboard and some cute pins and thumbtacks.
 Try to mix them up, so that you don't have four red skirts together, unless that's the look you want. Don't glue anything down until you're happy with your layout.
 If you're using paper as a base, a gluestick works best, or double sided tape or glue dots. For corkboards, use pins and tacks.
 Add stickers and gems, if desired. Hang your collage somewhere you'll see it when you get dressed for inspiration, or cut shape from it for cute fashion-themed decorations for scrapbooking. The possibilities are endless!

 You will need to complete some of the story before you get access to Mega Evolutions. Completing these tasks will give you the item you need to perform Mega Evolutions. Obtain the Rumble Badge from Shalour Gym by defeating Korrina.
 Go to the top of the Tower of Mastery after the battle and talk to Korrina again to receive the Mega Ring., The upgraded ring isn't necessary for all Mega Evolutions, but is required in order to find the hidden Mega Stones. Professor Sycamore will upgrade your Mega Ring at the Anistar Sundial after you defeat your rival in Kiloude City.

These stones are specific to each Pokémon, and only a handful of Pokémon are able to Mega Evolve with them.

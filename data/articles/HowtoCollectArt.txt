 What makes art good will vary from person to person.
 Random pictures from random artists are just that... Random. Think about what things attract you to a picture. What is/are the common theme of the pieces that you find appealing? Pastoral scenes? Abstract? Well defined facial features? The treatment of light and shadow?, Narrow down your search to general categories... and then catalog that category into it's sub groups. Doing so will focus your collecting efforts and give you some parameters by which to judge any potential addition to your collection.

For example: Find the type of art you like, then make a list of artists who create that type of art. Separate the artists by time period, geographic area, etc.
 Where did they live? What sorts of things influenced their art? Where did they create? All of this type of information helps you know where to look for more of their work., Art Museums, Art Galleries, Art Fairs etc are good starting places., You can purchase some very nice works quite cheaply... but you can also purchase some execrable works quite expensively. Do your research. Knowledge is power.

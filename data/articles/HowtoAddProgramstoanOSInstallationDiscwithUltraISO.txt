 In the bottom left of the window, find the folder where you saved your installation image to.;
, Double click this to open it in the section above.



You can go to Actions in the UltraISO menubar. Then press either Add Files (Or press F3 on your keyboard) to add individual files one by one. Or press Add Directory to add an entire folder.
You can also simply click and drag the folders, from Explorer, into the UltraISO window where it displays your installation image.


Go to File and press Save (or you can press Control+S) if you want it to be saved in the same file.






Or click Save As if you want to save the ISO with the programs separate to the original. This can also be done by pressing the small disk buttons on the toolbar below the menu bar.
 This is a lengthy process so be patient.

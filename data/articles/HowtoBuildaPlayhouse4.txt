 For this, you will need 1-2 large cardboard boxes, all-purpose glue, wrapping paper or wallpaper, packing tape, and a box cutter or scissors.
 Start by cutting off extraneous pieces so that the box lies upside down on the ground and has no bottom (or top, if it is right-side up). Tape all the seams and loose areas to make sure that it won’t fall apart.
 To give your playhouse a better appearance than just a cardboard box, cover the sides one at a time with an all-purpose glue and a wrapping paper or wallpaper of your choice.
 Use a box-cutter or scissors to cut a small door from the bottom of one of the sides, and as many windows as you would like.









You can choose to cut only three sides of the door, leaving one “hinged” side attached so that the door can be open and closed instead of just an empty space.
You can add clear plastic or cellophane on the inside of the box to give the appearance of windows on the outside.
 To do this, cut two large triangle pieces of cardboard out from another box or a spare piece, making them the width of the house Then, cut out two large rectangles the same length as the box and height as the triangles.









Attach the four roof pieces together with glue and tape.
cut out cardboard “shingles” in small rectangles or semi-circles and glue these in an overlapping pattern over the top of the triangle. Cut off any extras that go over the edge.
If you want, you can use spray paint to give the roof a bit of color.
 Once the roof is finished, glue and tape it to the top of the cardboard box. You are finished! Feel free to add any further decorative touches, or enjoy it as-is.

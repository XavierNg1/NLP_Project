 A healthy digestive system will result in "regular" bowel movements. However, "regular" is a relative term. Figure out your normal bowel movement frequency so you can be aware of changes that may be early warning signs of health problems.


Generally, a healthy frequency for bowel movements ranges from once every three days up to three times daily. Diarrhea is defined as more than three trips to the toilet in one day. Constipation, conversely, occurs when bowel movements are spaced more than three days apart., Healthy feces should slowly drift to the bottom of the toilet. If your bowel movement readily floats, your diet is likely to just be very high in fiber.


Pancreatitis causes impaired lipid absorption, leading to fatty floating stools. These bowel movements are extremely oily, releasing immiscible droplets into the toilet bowl., No poop is going to smell pleasant. In fact, a pungent smell can be indicative of healthy gut flora. However, certain health problems can cause feces that smell significantly stronger than usual. These include bloody stool, infectious diarrhea, and nutrient malabsorption syndromes.

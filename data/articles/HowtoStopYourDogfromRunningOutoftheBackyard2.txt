 Dogs can be quite agile, and if your fence isn't high enough or offers some footholds, he can jump over top of it. Try the following to make it difficult for your dog to hop over your fence:Check the areas near the fence. Look for any objects that your dog could be using to get over the fence. It may be a chair or some potted plants, with just enough height to help your dog make the jump. Move them away from the fence.
Install a fence extension.You can try to make your fence taller if your dog seems to be big enough to jump over by himself. When you add the extension, try to slant the new addition inwards at about a forty-five degree angle. This will make it very difficult for your dog to make the leap.
 Sometimes, dogs will take the low road, and dig under a fence to escape. There are a few methods you can use to reinforce your fence and make any attempts at burrowing more difficult for your dog.Dig down and place chicken wire below the fence. Make sure to point any sharp edges outwards, away from the inside of the fence, to prevent injury to your dog.
Try putting large stones around the foot of the fence. By putting these stones in place, your dog will be unable to dig close to the fence and escape.
If you install a chain link fence, make sure to leave enough height to put some of it underground. This will make an escape by digging difficult, as your dog will have to dig down quite far to break free.
Look for any other small gaps he may be squeezing through and cover them up.
 This can not only be dangerous for your dog, but can be an expense as well.


Your best option is to figure out what is triggering your dog's escapes and alter that.
Install a fence made from a material that is hard to chew through. Sturdy wood or metal can be good options, but if your dog chews them, it may prevent a health hazard.

 Include as much exercise as your physical condition allows. Physical activity increases the bodyâ€™s flexibility and helps pump the blood through your arteries. And of course, follow your doctor's advice too.


Choose a form of exercise you can do for 10-20 minutes at a time, with at least moderate intensity, such as walking, biking, swimming, jogging, or using an exercise machine at low speed.First, exercise stimulates enzymes that help move LDL from the blood (and blood-vessel walls) to the liver. From there, the cholesterol is converted into bile (for digestion) or excreted. So the more you exercise, the more LDL your body expels.Second, exercise increases the size of the protein particles that carry cholesterol through the blood.That's a good thing -- the smaller, denser ones burrow into the lining of your heart and start clogging away. How's that for a mental image?



, It doesn't have to be a lot, either. If you lose just 5 to 10% of your weight, your cholesterol levels could reduce greatly. Not to mention the scads of other health benefits!Watch your calories. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it: An increased caloric intake will lead to weight gain. Keep a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and low-fat dairy. Stick to good fats (like the ones in avocados, nuts, and olive oil) and cut out the processed junk.
Try to incorporate activity into your daily endeavors. Opt for the stairs instead of the elevator, make taking the dog for a walk a pre-dinner activity, and bike to do an errand or two. Exercise doesn't always have to be a formal "workout" session if your schedule or body doesn't allow for it.

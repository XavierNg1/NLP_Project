 You may think some grocery stores are better than others in terms of quality, but you may be wrong. If you go to a cheaper supermarket, you may think the quality isn't that great, but that's incorrect -- it just depends on which location you go to. You can find great quality and prices if you select a branch of a cheaper supermarket that looks great to you.
 These days you can actually find most grocery items, including frozen foods, pre-packaged salads, fruits, and fresh vegetables at your local 99 Cents Store.
 You may feel embarrassed to use them, but they will help you save a lot. Always invest in buying the Sunday newspaper to clip some coupons. Twenty-five to fifty cents can go a long way. Every bit counts.
 Sure, it's tempting to just buy fast food or eat out in general, but when you can, try to buy food from the supermarket for lunch and/or dinner. But if you think about it, if you ate out almost everyday, you could have probably used about 20% of what you paid to eat out that week to buy a week's worth of lunches and/or dinners.

 This is about capturing the kinetic energy of wind to power mechanical devices. Humans have been doing this for as long as they've known how to make windmills and water wheels. Wind power is usually generated using turbines with blades nowadays and many power companies are able to sell electricity created from wind power to you.
 You could try contacting your local energy company and asking if it provides wind powered electricity as an option. If not, consider putting in a small wind turbine on your own property. You'll need to check local planning laws about the permissibility of adding such a structure to your property.
 Wind energy is unpredictable. If you have a long period of no wind, you won't get any power at all from this energy source. Always have an alternative power source that you can rely on, or team this up with another green energy source.

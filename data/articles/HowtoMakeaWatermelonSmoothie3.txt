 You can do this by cutting a watermelon into cubes and then removing the rind. You can also cut a watermelon in half, and then scoop out the flesh using a melon scoop or coffee scoop.
 You can use fresh or frozen strawberries. If you use frozen strawberries, your smoothie will be thicker and colder than if you just used fresh strawberries. If you choose to use fresh strawberries, be sure to chop off the stems first., Use plain yogurt if you'd like your smoothie to be less sweet, and vanilla yogurt if you'd like it to be more sweet. You can use any fat-percentage of yogurt you want: non-fat, 2%, or full-fat., You can use any type of milk, be it cow's, almond, coconut, or soy. An almond-coconut blend is recommended, however., If the watermelon you are using is already very sweet (and you added in the vanilla yogurt) then you probably do not need the nectar or honey., If you used frozen strawberries, you probably won't need the full amount of ice cubesâ€”one or two might be plenty! If you used fresh strawberries, however, you might want to add all the ice in., Keep blending until the ice is all broken up, and the watermelon, strawberries, yogurt, and milk are all evenly mixed together. You should not see any lumps, clumps, streaks, or swirls., If you'd like to get fancy, garnish each glass with a watermelon slice or a strawberry on the rim.

 Do not just assume your partner wants to slow dance. (Unless maybe you are the bride and groom at a wedding.) He or she might want to take a break, or otherwise leave the dance floor. If you're a man who brought a date, you can give her your hand with a flourish and say,"Shall we?" If you're a girl who brought a date, then gently take your partner by the hand and pull him up as you ask him to dance. Even if you don't have a partner, you should still look the person in the eyes when you ask him or her to dance, and even give him or her a playful smile or grin.









Don't worry if you're nervous -- it's likely that the person is nervous, too. Hide your nervousness by smiling and asking with confidence.;
, Once your partner has accepted your tempting proposition, then you should escort him or her to the dance floor slowly or smoothly -- there's no need to rush. Remember to "savor" the moment. If you know the person well or are dating, you can hold hands or link elbows as you head to the dance floor. The male should lead the way to the floor and on the floor, so the guy should clasp his partner's right hand with his left, lift it slightly, and guide the girl to the floor.









Girls, if your partner doesnâ€™t automatically guide you onto the floor, give him your right hand or crook your elbow into his and walk onto the floor.
If you're already on the dance floor, the key is to keep yourself and your partner on the dance floor--no easy task if one or both of you is nervous about slow dances. If your partner is nervous, smile and tell him or her that there's nothing to worry about.

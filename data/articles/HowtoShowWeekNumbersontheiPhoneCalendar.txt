 You can find the Settings app on one of your Home screens. It may be in a folder labeled "Utilities.";
, If you're using an older device, tap "Mail, Contacts, Calendar."

, When the switch is enabled, it will move to the right and turn green. Week numbers will appear when you are viewing the whole month in the Calendar app. You'll see the week number on the left end of each week. You'll also see the week number below the days of the week in the daily view (i.e. W2 for Week 2).

 Memory foam can provide comfort to cats with joint problems, circulation issues, or weak legs. Look for a cat bed made out of ordinary memory foam, or gel-infused memory foam for extra support. Look online or in pet stores for a cat bed or dog bed, for cats who enjoy having a roomier resting spot., Cold air can aggravate joint pain in cats, leading to pain and stiffness in already mobility-impaired cats. Refrain from turning off or significantly reducing the heat while you are out of the house. You can also provide warm spots for your cat to rest, like warm blankets or furniture moved into the sunlight, which will help soothe pain and improve flexibility. , While a comfortable temperature is good for mobility-impaired cats, direct heat is even more effective in terms of pain relief, improved flexibility, and comfort. Buy a heated or self-warming cat bed at a pet store or look for microwaveable bed warmers, which can be added to your cat's favorite resting spot to keep it warm. Heat can be especially beneficial for cats whose mobility is hindered by conditions like:Spinal injury
Arthritis
Hip dysplasia

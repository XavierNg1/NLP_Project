 It might be a place you've been or want to visit, a passion of yours, a person or animal, an object, an imaginary world, or anything else you want.;
, Surf the net and dig through magazines and books for inspiration. Want to be drawing a book about an imaginary world? Than get pictures of unicorns and descriptions of how ogres live! You should get all the pictures, quotations, drawings, idea's and stories you can about your subject!

, Study the figurine so you can see the proportions and details. Looking at the map can help you design your own and maybe give you some ideas for names.
 This step is optional, but it may help you. You can write down what page will contain what, what style it'll be drawn in (cartoon,realistic,sketched,etc) and any other notes you want.
 Pick whatever size or style you want. If you can, get one that is decorated with the same thing as your book subject. It should be sturdy and have quality paper so it won't get damaged. Another great thing to get would be a blank book. If it's cover isn't glossed, you can draw on it!

,, Set aside time each day to draw your book. You might decide to do one page a day or an hour a week.
 Photocopy all of the pages in your sketchbook (and number them too!). Contact a publishing agency looking for picture/art/etc books. If they want to see your book, then you can mail it. Be sure too mail the photocopy and not your original artwork,though. You should either laminate the manuscript that you're sending or put it in a binder.

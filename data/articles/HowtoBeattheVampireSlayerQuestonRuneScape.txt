 He will tell you about a Vampire. Then he will tell you to talk to Dr.Harlow in the Blue Moon Inn, which is South in Varrock, across from the Weapon Store. Do not go there yet.;
, Then go talk to Dr. Harlow.
 Then he'll give you a stake.
 Go to Draynor Mansion and go down the stairs. The stairs are in the West room. Open the Coffin and out pops the vampire.
 Own him till he has "no" health. His health bar will be red. Use the garlic again on him. If he doesn't die, then use the stake on him.
 Congrats! The reward is 4825 Attack Experience and 3 Quest Points.

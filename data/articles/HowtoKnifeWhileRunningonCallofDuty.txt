 When you see somebody running at you, whatever you do, do not step to the side! This basically gives them a 100% knife shot.So be sure that if you have the intention to knife to run right into them straightly, and that you do it approximately one second before your right even with the opponent.;
, 1 out of 10 running knife kills are a blessing from God. Knifing is usually done while your behind someone, but it is getting more done now whilst running. So most of the time if you're not doing a knife running technique then it's a blessing from God.
 Your normal intention most likely is to shoot right away unless God tells you to knife the guy right away. So be sure to have the collect thought to knife an enemy if they're really close.

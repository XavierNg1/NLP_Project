 These are simply - a paper or cardstock background base, clear-drying craft glue, sand, a pencil and a glue brush.
 Simpler designs are best for small children; let them draw whatever they like., If the design is intricate or large, do this in small steps, to allow you to work with the glue while it's still wet.
 This can be done using your hand or a small paper cup.
 The remaining sand will outline the design.

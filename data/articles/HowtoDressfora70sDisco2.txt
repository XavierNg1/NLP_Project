 Choose a stretchy, tight, form-fitting material like spandex. Look for metallic colors, leopard print, or "psychedelic" patterns. You can either go for a halter-top dress or a dress with long, flared sleeves, but avoid spaghetti straps and strapless dresses.



Select a shiny satin top with a metallic look. A top covered in sequins is also appropriate.
Wear bellbottom pants. If mimicking the jumpsuit look, choose pants that match the color and material of your top. Otherwise, any form-fitting, shimmering bottom will work.



Choose a pair of knee-high platform boots in either white or black if you decide to wear a mini-dress.
Wear a standard platform shoe if you decide to wear pants. Boots are not necessary.
 Think large hoop earrings, medallion pendants, and silver bangle bracelets.
 Tame your locks into sleek, shiny tresses for the occasion.


Alternatively, you can try styling your hair in large Farrah Fawcett style curls.

 If the core group determines the garden club will meet in the evening, organize the first meeting for an evening. If the core group prefers a daytime meeting, plan the launch meeting for during the day.
 Consider meeting at a local garden center, botanical garden or community center for the first meeting. Avoid meeting in someone's home because potential new members may not feel comfortable going to a meeting at the home of someone they don't know.
 To attract people to the meeting, consider scheduling a horticulture lecture, a hands-on flower arranging program or a plant exchange. A planned activity or event is more likely to draw people to your club.


Include time to present information about the new gardening club to attendees. Plan to distribute flyers about the club and ask attendees to provide contact information so they can be notified about future meetings.
 Distribute flyers at local garden centers, community centers, botanical gardens and coffee shops.


Ask each member of the core group to bring a few friends to the launch meeting. Personal invitations are the most effective way to encourage membership and participation in a gardening club.

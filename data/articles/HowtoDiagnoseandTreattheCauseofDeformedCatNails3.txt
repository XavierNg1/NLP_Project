 If the deformed nail is an ingrown nail that has been infected, the vet may have to cut or remove the nail. Even just cutting the nail can be very painful for your cat. The vet may have to put them under anesthesia so they do not experience too much pain.If there are other problems with the nail, the vet may cut away part of the nail before treating it in another way.
 If the deformed nail is due to an infection or ringworm, your vet will prescribe antibiotics or other medications to treat the infection. If the infection is due to a fungus, antifungals will be prescribed. They may be in the form of an oral tablet, a soak, or a topical ointment.This treatment may last up to three months after a healthy nail has replaced the deformed one.
 Most reasons for nail deformities are treatable with medication or minor nail surgery. Most cats recover quickly. However, you should still monitor the nail to make sure it heals and doesn't develop any additional problems or get worse.

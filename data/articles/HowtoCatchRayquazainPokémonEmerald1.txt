 You won't unlock these two areas until later in the game, so if you can't yet go to Pacifidlog town as part of the main quest, you can't get Rayquaza just yet.


Pacifidlog town is west of Route 131, and is encountered later in the game than most areas.;
, If you don't have a Mach Bike, you can't catch Rayquaza at all, as there are weak spots in the floor that will sink you if aren't going full speed on the bike.
 You'll need to hit the ocean in order to get to Rayquaza, but this should be common by the time you're ready to fight the beast. If you don't have a Pokémon in your party with Surf, grab one from earlier in your adventures.
 Rayquaza is the most powerful natural Pokémon you'll find in the game and is already at lv70 when you encounter it. In order to weaken it enough to capture it, you'll need some Pokémon that can hold their own against a high-level monster.You can get Rayquaza either before or after the Elite 4, it is your choice.
 This is probably your best chance to use the Master Ball, which will capture Rayquaza automatically, no questions asked. But if you don't have it anymore, Ultra Balls will do, so long as you have a strong team capable of weakening him/her first.
 These moves make it much, much easier to successfully capture the Legendary Monster, and they prevent him from fighting back for a few turns. Note, of course, that the higher-level the Pokémon using the move is, the more likely it will succeed.
 In the main quest, you'll meet Rayquaza the first time you go to Sky Pillar. It'll immediately fly away, but you see him again later when he fights Kyogre and Groudon. In this necessary cut-scene (unlocked by flying to Sootopolis after awakening Rayquaza), Rayquaza appears and breaks up the fight, then flies away. As soon as this is finished, you can return to the Sky Pillar to catch Rayquaza for real.


If you haven't gotten this far in the quest, you can't catch Rayquaza.

 A good pair is one that isn't really getting worn because they're unfashionable. Any color is fine, ranging from navy to white. Try them on and see that they fit well at the shoulders, crotch, and waist. If they are too short, that is not a problem as you're turning them into shorts anyway.;
, Mark them to where you would like your shorts to fall. Take off the overalls.
 This is where you will cut the shorts. It's much better to run on the long side than the short side while making these - you can always cut off more.
 Note that measurement. Measure the outer seam of the same leg and mark it at the same measurement as the mark on the inseam. Make a line and cut the leg.
 Line up the legs and cut off the extra on the other pant leg.
 If you desire to have the overalls be a lighter color, put the cut overalls in a large plastic tub. Fill halfway with water. Add about a cup of bleach. Let sit until desired color is reached (anywhere from 2 hours to overnight). Rinse the overalls. Put them in the washer on spin cycle and finally dry them in the dryer.
 If you desire the mellow, stained look some jeans have, fill a large tub halfway with hot water. Add one cup of coffee grounds and stir until you have a deep brown liquid (more coffee grounds can be added if you desire a darker color). Add the cut overalls and let sit overnight. Rinse the overalls. Put them in the washer on spin cycle and finally dry them in the dryer.
 Remember how you cut them a bit too long? To get a finished look, roll the ends of the shorts up twice back to your desired length. To achieve a frayed look, use a dull knife and pull the threads at the ends of the shorts and cut the really long threads off (be sure to take them off first!).
 Rhinestones can be glued on. Acrylic paints are permanent. Fabric paint designs can be added. Cool patches can brighten them up. Have fun with them!

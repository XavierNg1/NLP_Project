 Locate the app on your device. The app icon has the Star Wars logo on it with some cards in the background. Tap on it.
 Tap the cards icon on the rightmost part of the bottom toolbar. You will be brought to the screen with your current inventory of cards.


By default, the initial view will be “My Cards.” You can see this title at the header toolbar. Swipe up and down to see all your cards.
 Tap the My Cards title on the header to drop down a list. Tap “My Locked Cards” to filter your cards to display only those you’ve locked. These cards cannot be selected for trade by others until you’ve unlocked them. All of them will have a small padlock icon on their upper right side.
 Tap the card you want to unlock. It will be enlarged and shown on a full screen.
 Tap the padlock icon on the bottom toolbar. The card will now be unlocked and you can again receive trade offers for it. A confirmation message will appear indicating such.


Tap the “OK” button to go back to the card. The small padlock on the upper right side of the card will now be gone.
 This will exit you from the card view and back to My Locked Cards.

 Adjust your driving if in heavy traffic or inclement weather. Sixty mph may be safe when it's dry, but if a sudden rain falls, wetting the roadway and raising oil off the ground, it will probably be safer to drive at a lower speed.
 While driving, avoid using cell phones, reading maps, eating and other distracting activities. If you are a passenger, sit up straight with your seat-belt fastened. Don't lean your seat too far back, don't put your feet up on the dashboard, and definitely do not distract the driver. Do not place objects on top of the airbag enclosure.
 Observe the road looking for things that could end up causing an accident.


Look ahead for cars or pedestrians that may move into your car's path.
Keeping a safe distance behind other vehicles (following the "two second rule" ) can help you have enough time to react when a vehicle in front of you makes an unexpected move.
Stay away from distracted drivers (e.g., the guy on his way to work using an electric razor), tailgaters and other drivers engaging in risky behaviors.
Keep an eye on parked cars. They may pull out in front of you; people may exit from them or move from between them without much warning.

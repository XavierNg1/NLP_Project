 Decide which types of photographs must come first, whether you need to include captions or descriptions or write down important notes in between. Plan out your layout carefully and thoroughly. Should you put many pictures on one page, creating a photo collage, or would you rather have a single enlarged picture that will easily grasp all of the attention?;
, Here, you are focusing on fashion so consider choosing different shots of the models. Make sure you get a variety of photographs with different types of lighting, different camera angles, and different sets, showing off your ample skills.
 Pick a bunch of photographs to put in, and slowly weed them down to the best of the best. Skip the boring or generic shots and opt instead for ones that showcase an interesting angle or subject. Pick some of your favourites and ask friends, family, or other photographers you know to offer their advice on which ones to put in.
 These themes can be based on the clothing that the model is wearing, the lighting, the setting, etc. This shows the audience that you can provide beautiful shots in different scenarios. Make sure to organize them systematically.
 If you want to glue your photos into a portfolio, make sure you do it attractively, and be sure to use suitable glue which does not show too much and does not drip, as this will spoil your portfolio's appearance. Another option is to arrange your photographs on a computer and print the entire page out on high-quality photo paper. The choice is up to you - do whichever one you feel more comfortable with and that you feel will have the best effect.
 Give your everything to make the portfolio attractive to the audience. Give suitable borders to the pages, decorate the front pages, write captions, etc. Add whatever you think would be good for the portfolio. Avoid going crazy and making it too gaudy or too decorative. Make it sensible, humble and professional. Be sure that you put in your name and contact information as well.

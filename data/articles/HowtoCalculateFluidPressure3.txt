 The density of the liquid is significant because it tells you how much mass your liquid has per unit of volume. Gravity then exerts a force on that mass to pull it down. Finally, the height of the liquid tells you how much liquid is above the object experiencing the pressure., The units for fluid pressure are pascals or sometimes millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The pascal is an S.I. unit for pressure. The mmHg unit (and similar units that denote a height of some liquid) comes from the dependency of pressure on height., The force that is exerted on some object by fluid pressure is only one force. There could many forces acting on the same object. For example, air pressure and fluid pressure are often added together to obtain a “total pressure” acting on some object., Once you have calculated fluid pressure for a liquid or set of liquids, you can use them for varying applications. For example, understanding the fluid pressure of water would be important to building a water tower that can hold water at a certain height. This is also important for use in mercury thermometers, or other systems that use liquids as measurements.

If you use the Google Maps app instead of Apple Maps, ensure that Google Maps is set on as well.
, This will center the map on your location based on the GPS location of your iPhone.


GPS can be inaccurate due to a poor connection or weather factors. If there is a large blue circle around your location in Maps, then the iPhone is having a difficult time locking into the GPS network.

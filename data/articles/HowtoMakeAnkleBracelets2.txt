 One piece will most likely be too weak to hold beads, using two or three strings will lengthen the lifetime of your beaded ankle bracelet. Cut your string at your ankle length.
 Do this by taking all three pieces of your string and lining them up. Now fold them in half. Mark this spot with a pen.
 Choose which bead you want in the center of your ankle bracelet and slide it onto the string. Move it down to the point that you just marked and tie knots on either side of it. This is now your center bead.


Beads can represent your outfit, mood, or personality. Choose beads that convey the message that you want.
 In order to slide the rest of your beads onto your ankle bracelet, fold your string over a toothpick. This will be thin enough for your beads to fit over, but strong enough to keep your string from fraying at the ends.
 Using your tape measure, mark ½” away from your center bead in both directions. Tie a knot at this spot and slide your next bead onto your ankle bracelet. Knot it again after the bead is in place.
 Keep measuring ½” from each bead and fill your ankle bracelet with evenly spaced beads. Be sure to knot each one on both sides of the bead so that they stay where you want them.
 Once you have beaded your ankle bracelet until there is approximately 2” of thread left on each side, test the length around your ankle. If you want to add one, or you need to take one off, now is the time for those adjustments.
 For a beaded ankle bracelet, it is smart to use a clasp because the beads are heavier than just the string. A lobster clasp is the best for an ankle bracelet and is easily tied onto each side.You don’t necessarily have to use a clasp, but it extend the life of your beaded ankle bracelet if you do.

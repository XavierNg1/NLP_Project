 On the PC, Mac, and Linux edition, if you’ve installed the game correctly and enabled shortcuts, you can find the shortcut icon of Minecraft on your desktop. Simply double-click the icon, and it will open the launcher. You can then log into your account and press the “Play” button near the bottom of the window to launch the game, then press the “Singleplayer” option once the game loads. On the console edition, simply place the CD in and run it from here.;
, Before everything else, you will need to find a place where it’s constantly snowing. This is because ice only forms when there’s snowfall on a patch of water. Biomes like Cold Taigas, Ice Plains, Snowy Beaches, and Ice Spike Plains are your best bet for an Ice farm, since it’s constantly snowing there, though be prepared, since these areas are a bit tough to survive in. These biomes are normally somewhat difficult to survive in due to the lack of abundant resources.


Other candidate Biomes are places like Taigas and Extreme Hills, which have snow the higher up you are in the biome, though it can be a bit tricky to climb, and falling off those areas can lead to instant death and loss of your items.
 Cold Taigas, Ice Plains, Snowy Beaches, and Ice Spike Plains are distinguished by the white layer covering the ground from the constant snowfall. Taigas and Extreme Hills can be distinguished by the dull, almost bluish coloration of the grass and the abundance of either Stone or Spruce Trees (trees with a very dark-brown wood and dark blue-green leaves). Normally, you can easily find these areas by exploring your world, and sometimes you’re lucky enough to be on one or near one when you first make the world.


Each biome is randomly generated across the world though. You’ll only have to rely on the scenery to determine where you are, so there are no absolute guarantees that a certain direction leads to any of them, meaning you’ll have to explore extensively if you want your farm ready!

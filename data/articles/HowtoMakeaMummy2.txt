 Use a plastic bag, a trash bag, or a grocery bag. Create a thick, padded layer around the mummy. This will mimic the sarcophagus shape.After wrapping, your mummy should look like a small plastic baguette.
 Lay paste-covered strips of paper or fabric all over the plastic. Wrap the strips completely around the mummy so that all parts are covered. Add three or four layers to create a thick sarcophagus wall.


Let each layer dry for an hour or two before applying another., Set the sarcophagus in a sunny spot to dry for a day or two. To check whether or not it’s ready, gently press a finger against the papier mâché. The sarcophagus should feel stiff and chalky to the touch.


Place the sarcophagus under a fan to speed up the drying process.The sarcophagus needs to be completely dry before you paint it. Otherwise, it may mold and fall apart.
 Use craft scissors or a crafting blade to carefully cut the sarcophagus in half. First, lay the sarcophagus on its back. Next, carefully make an incision halfway up the side of the sarcophagus. Continue cutting all around the side to create a front half and a back half.


If needed, use a pencil to draw a guide line around the sides. Follow this line when cutting the sarcophagus.
 Use acrylic paints to paint the sarcophagus and allow it to dry completely. Use a metallic gold paint for the face and body accents. Use a combination of red, blue, and green for the other parts of the sarcophagus. Consider adding authentic touches to the outside. For example:


Add black and blue accent stripes along the side.
Paint on Egyptian symbols, such as the symbol for Anubis.
Detail small “offerings” by painting depictions of grain, bread, or gold., First, cut away and discard the plastic wrapping around the mummy. Next, lay the mummy in the bottom half of the sarcophagus. Place the lid on top to enclose your mummy.

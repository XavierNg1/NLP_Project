 If you suspect that your cat has heatstroke or heat exhaustion, you should try to lower the cat’s temperature. Immediately take your pet to a cool area. This might be inside in a cool house or car or in the shade. Remove the cat from the heat source or the sun.If you can, try to get air flowing onto the cat with a fan or an air conditioning duct.
 After your have removed your cat to a cooler area, you should try to lower the cat’s temperature. You can soak your cat with lukewarm or cool water. You can put them in a tub, sink, or pool full of water. You may also pour water over your cat’s body. Another measure you can try is to place cool towels on your cat’s stomach, head, and feet.Give your cat cold water to drink. If the cat won’t drink it, use a syringe to gently place water into the cat’s mouth. Make sure to only put a little water in the cat's mouth at a time. Angle the syringe to the side of the mouth instead of directly into the back of the mouth. If you squirt the water into the back of the mouth, the cat may choke.Place a bag of ice around the cat’s head and anus.Make sure not to use cold water on your cat’s body because it could cool their body too fast and lead to additional problems.If your cat’s temperature gets below 103 degrees Fahrenheit, they may be too cold. Watch the cat to make sure they don’t start showing symptoms of being too cold, like shivering.
 If your cat has suffered heatstroke, you should take them to the vet. The vet can take the cat’s temperature to get an accurate reading, and then they will help cool the cat down if they are not cool enough. The cat may also be given an IV of fluids.Even if you have lowered your cat’s temperature, it’s a good idea to take your cat to the vet to make sure they are fine and not in danger.

 Make it cute-first impressions do count! Try not to do anything boring such as "hi". Something cute or enthusiastic "Hey, what's up?" is better.
 That's the boy's job. Most boys will do enough bragging or whining about their lives for both of you. They do seem to enjoy it, somehow, so try to encourage it. For example, if they play basketball, say, "Hey, I really liked that three-pointer you made last night." or something like that. Don't make it all about them, however. That just gets them started, and it gets really annoying., It's okay to act flirty, most boys like it. Say, "I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow!" rather than "See you tomorrow." Go for the gusto., After you ask them a question or compliment about sports, or whatever hobby they have, connect it with yourself. For example: "I really liked that three-pointer you made the other day. By the way, I've got a baseball game next Saturday, at Example Park. You can come if you want--it's at 4:30.", "Can't wait to see ya tomorrow!",

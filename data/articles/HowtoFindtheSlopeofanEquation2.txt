 If you've got a graph and a line, but no equation, you can still find the slope with ease. All you need are two points on the line, which you plug into the equation y2−y1x2−x1{\displaystyle {\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}}. While finding the slope, keep in mind the following information to help you check if you're on the right track:

Positive slopes go higher the further right you go.

Negative slopes go lower the further right you go.

Bigger slopes are steeper lines. Small slopes are always more gradual.

Perfectly horizontal lines have a slope of zero.

Perfectly vertical lines do not have a slope at all. Their slope is "undefined.", Use the graph (or the test question) to find the x and y coordinates of two points on the graph. They can be any two points that the line crosses through. For an example, assume that the line in this method goes through (2,4) and (6,6).In each pair, the x coordinate is the first number, the y coordinate comes after the comma.

Each x coordinate on a line has an associated y coordinate.
 Continuing our first example, with the points (2,4) and (6,6), label the x and y coordinates of each point. You should end up with:


x1: 2


y1: 4


x2: 6


y2: 6, The following formula is used to find slope using any two points on a straight line: y2−y1x2−x1{\displaystyle {\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}}. Simply plug in your four points and simplify:


Original Points: (2,4) and (6,6).


Plug into Point Slope:


6−46−2{\displaystyle {\frac {6-4}{6-2}}} 




Simplify for Final Answer:


24=12{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}={\frac {1}{2}}} = Slope




, The slope of a line is “Rise over Run:” how much the line goes up divided by how much the line "runs" to the right. The “rise” of the line is the difference between the y-values (remember, the Y-axis goes up and down), and the “run” of the line is the difference between the x-values (and the X-axis goes left and right).
 The equation of the slope is y2−y1x2−x1{\displaystyle {\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}}. This may also be shown using the Greek letter “Δ”, called “delta”, meaning “difference of”. Slope can also be shown as Δy/Δx, meaning "difference of y / difference of x:" this is the same exact question as "find the slope between

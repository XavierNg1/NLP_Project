 If the glasses are stubborn, and you're making no progress by simply tilting/twisting the glasses apart, the next step is to apply some light lubrication. A bit of olive or sunflower oil may do the trick. Try using soap. This is especially effective if the glasses are "pinched" together, rather than stuck fast.


Consider using the oil method in conjunction with the heating method. This may be effective on especially stubborn glasses.
Try using WD-40 oil as a last-ditch resort. Spray it between the glass. The oil should spread thoroughly by itself, and it should be relatively easy to pull the glasses away from each other. Make sure to wash the glasses thoroughly after doing this: WD-40 is toxic to humans.
 Work the oil into the pinch point by gently tilting the upper glass back and forth. As you rock the glasses, the oil may loosen them up enough that they come apart. Wet the glasses so spread the lubricant around.


Try using some kind of thin drinking straw or a knife to push the liquid in thoroughly. Be gentle!

, When you think they are lubricated enough, grab the inner glass with your dominant hand and the outer glass with your other hand. Twist the glasses in opposite directions to loosen the grip. At the same time, pull them apart with a lesser force. Focus on trying to twist it more than pulling it. If the twisting works, the glass should come off by itself.


Don't try to pull the glasses straight off! The force needed to grip the glass could break the glass itself.

 The roses will scent it but it must be a good tea to begin with, so that you enjoy the blend. You could also choose oolong tea, a blend of black and green, with their lovely, rich and fruity flavours.
 Stir gently to combine.


If wished, small dried rosebuds can be included for appearance. Ensure that these are organic too.
 Label and date so that you remember when it was made and when it should be used by.
 Most of the flavour will come out with the hot water when the tea is made though, so there's no need to wait too long.
 The tea will be gently scented with the added rose petals.

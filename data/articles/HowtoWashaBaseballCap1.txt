 First you will need to look closely at your baseball cap to determine if it can be washed and the best approach.;
,









Look carefully at the material, stitches, and the brim. If your hat is made with good quality materials, is relatively new, and has solid stitching you should be able to wash it without trouble.
Look for signs that the hat is inexpensive or poorly constructed. If the cap has loose stitching or a cardboard brim it might fall apart if you wash it. If the hat was inexpensive it might make more sense to replace it than to attempt to wash it. , If you your cap is very old, you should take extra care and only wash it by hand.
 A tag on your baseball cap might have washing instructions and other information about the material. Follow the washing instructions if the manufacturer included any on the tag.








Determine the kind of fabric. If your hat is made from cotton, polyester, or twill and is well made you should be able to wash it. If the cap is made from wool you should only hand wash it using special detergent designed for wool, like Woolite.

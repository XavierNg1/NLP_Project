, There are two sections in Filezilla, local site and remote site. The local site will show you an expandable drop down of all the files on the computer you are connecting with. The remote site will show you an expandable list of all the files on the server you have connected to.
 For this demonstration we will upload several photos to a folder on a website on the server. Click C: under local site to view the files on your computer. Click on the necessary folders until you find your files.
 Navigate through the files on your remote site (your website) until you are at the place where you want the files to end up.
 Select the first file you want to move and then press "ctrl" on your keyboard and select each additional file with the Ctrl button held down.

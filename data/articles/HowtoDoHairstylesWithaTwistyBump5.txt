 After brushing and parting as usual, choose a section of hair close to your hairline. Twist three times, push to create a bump, and pin it against your crown.
 Take one small section of your hair from the right side, and pin it to the midsection on your hair. Take another section of your hair from the left side, and pin it over the right section of your hair.
 This will set the shape of the twisty bump.

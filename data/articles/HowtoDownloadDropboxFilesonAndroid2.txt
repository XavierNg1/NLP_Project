 Locate Folder Downloader on your home screen or app drawer. Its icon is the blue folder with a curving down arrow on it. Tap it to launch.


Make sure you have Dropbox already installed in your Android device.
If you don’t have Folder Downloader for Dropbox, you can get it from Google Play. This app allows you to download entire folders from Dropbox.
 Once the app opens, it will ask permission to authenticate your Dropbox with the app. Tap “Authenticate” to allow permission.
 On the next screen, Folder Downloader will ask permission to access Dropbox. Tap the green-colored “Allow” button to continue.
 Once you have granted access, you will be redirected to the Folder Downloader main screen, which will display all the folders you have in your Dropbox account. Scroll through the list and locate the folder you want to download.


You can open a folder by tapping on it, so you can access other folders inside it.
 Tap and hold the folder name that you want to download, and tap “Download folder to” from the menu that appears. To download all the folders present in the Dropbox account at once, tap the “Download all to” option at the bottom of the screen.


Select the location in the SD card where you want your folder to be downloaded, and tap “OK.”
A new screen will pop up asking “Are you sure you want to start the download?” Tap “Yes” to download the folder(s).
 You will see the download progress in the screen that will appear after tapping “Yes.”


Download time will depend on the folder size.

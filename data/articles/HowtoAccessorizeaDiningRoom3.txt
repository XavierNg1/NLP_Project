 A typical dining room has fewer pieces of decor because the surfaces of the furniture need to remain empty for meals. The walls offer the best opportunity for adding a splash of style with photographs, paintings, prints, or shelves.Look for pieces that fit the style you chose for the space.
Consider how the pieces will look together.
 A large mirror can reflect the light in the room, making the room feel brighter. Look for a mirror that has a frame that fits the style you want. You can even find a dramatic frame that turns the mirror into a focal point in the room., Choosing a wall cover can change the whole look of the room. Consider painting it a fun color, or apply a wallpaper. You can decide to do the whole room, or you can limit the print to one wall.


Get samples of paint colors and wallpapers to see how they look in your room before you invest in your choice.
 Make one wall a focal point by setting it apart from the rest. You can use a special paint color or wallpaper, or you can use groupings of paintings or prints. Arrange items according to a central theme.


If you collect items, consider grouping your collections on shelves to create an accent wall.

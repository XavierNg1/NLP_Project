 Take an anagram and reorganize it. Use a standard such as alphabetizing to create a 'base set' of letters from the anagram. Alphabetizing an anagram makes a base set of letters because regardless of how the letters are scrambled, they can always be put back in the same order based on that “A-Z” standard.
 You can have anagrams that appear to be different, but if you alphabetize “drife” and “ifred,” you get “defir” as a base set for both. From the base set of letters “defir,” you can create “fried” and “fired.” Memorize the alphabetized base sets and the different words you can make from it.If you play word games like Scrabble or Words With Friends, then you might see familiar combinations of letters over time.
Memorizing anagram combinations will train you to see patterns in random letter combinations. It will help you solve crossword puzzles or word games faster.
 You want to be able to recognize basic combinations of letters anywhere. Make flashcards or reread your notebook full of anagrams to commit to memory the ones you've solved. Practice often to get into the habit of unscrambling anagrams so that you become more efficient at solving them in the future.

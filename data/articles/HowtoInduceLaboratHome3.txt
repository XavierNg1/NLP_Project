 Walking can help stir the baby into moving downward in your body. Once the baby’s head puts pressure on the cervix, labor isn’t far behind. Try walking for 15-20 minutes. Getting out in the fresh air can also be beneficial.Try walking up a steep hill. This will force your body to lean forward at an angle. Leaning at a 40-45 degree angle can help the baby move in the right downward direction.
 Galloping, or moving one leg forward and hopping the back leg to catch up, can help jar the baby slightly. Be careful when trying this to make sure you don’t trip over your feet., Walking up stairs will force your body to lean at an angle (about 40-45 degrees), which can help the baby move lower down in your body. Be sure to hold onto the handrail to make sure you are ascending the stairs safely.Pounding your feet on each step can also help.
 Doing a semi-strenuous activity can help bring on labor. Cleaning out the garage, vacuuming, or mopping the floors gets your body moving, which can activate labor. You’ll have the added bonus of having a clean house when the baby is born.

;
, An inexpensive press is just fine for this project.






Spade bit, same size as base of the rain gauge.







Measure the distance from the mark to the edges of the puck.






Move the mark until all distances to the edge are the same.






If drawing lines on the puck, keep them in the central area so they will disappear when the hole is drilled in the puck.
, Hockey pucks are soft. Using a slow speed prevents melting of the edge of the hole.
 You do not want to drill all the way through the hockey puck.
, Do not go all the way through.
, It should be loose enough that it can be removed for reading small amounts of rain, and for emptying. But it should be tight enough that it will stay upright and not be blown out by a gust of wind.
 That screw is used for anchoring the hockey puck to a board (deck railing, for instance). When snugged down, the screw should not interfere with the rain gauge.
 Install the rain gauge outside, and hope for a rainy day to come soon.

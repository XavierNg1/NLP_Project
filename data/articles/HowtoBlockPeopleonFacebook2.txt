 It's also possible to block someone who's blocking you directly from his or her profile page. This is convenient if you can't find this person with the method above.
 On the person's profile page, you should see several grey buttons to the right of their name and picture. On the far right, you'll see a button that looks like three dots (it's usually next to "Message"). Click this.
 A list of options should drop down from the "..." button. At the bottom, you should see "Block". Click this.
 A window will pop up explaining the details of the blocking process to you. To finish, click "Confirm" at the bottom. This will block this person.

 If you need to temporarily disable AVG on your Mac, you can turn off realtime protection from within the AVG program.


You can open AVG by clicking the button in your menu bar and selecting "Open AVG." You can also find AVG in your Applications folder.
 This will turn AVG off so that it isn't constantly monitoring your system.
 After you're finished with whatever it is that required AVG disabled, turn it back on to begin protecting your system again.


If you want to permanently remove AVG for your Mac, see the next section.

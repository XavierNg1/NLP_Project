 Once all the flowers have dropped for the season, the trumpet vine begins to enter dormancy, making it the perfect time to trim it down. Trimming the branches in the autumn also prevents seed pods from dropping and starting new vines.
 Use sharp pruning shears to cut away old stems that have become spindly or weak. These stems make your trumpet vine look more ragged and do not produce as much vibrant growth as newer stems. As such, woody stems should be removed first.
 Since many trumpet vines are trained to climb a vertical surface, like a trellis, you will likely want to trim away lateral shoots that would produce outward branches. On the other hand, if you want the trumpet vine to crawl over the ground or another flat surface, prune shoots at the top of the vine to encourage outward, rather than upward, growth.
 Even if you want the vine to climb upward, leaving the top branches alone will only cause the plant to direct all its energy to upward growth, creating a scraggly appearance. Cut the top stems down to 10 inches (25.4 cm) to encourage new, fuller growth. Focus on the heaviest sections of growth, creating a uniform appearance throughout the length of the vine.
 For instance, if you want an outward or horizontal covering, the remaining buds should be lateral buds that face outward. Likewise, if you want the vine to climb upward, the vines should be at the tip of the branches.
 If you remove much more than that, you run the risk of shocking the vine rather than encouraging it. A shocked vine will produce very little new growth.
 If new suckers have developed over the summer, dig them up and cut them away before they have the chance to take root.

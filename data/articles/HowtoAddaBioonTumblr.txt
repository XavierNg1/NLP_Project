, If you want to add a bio to your second blog rather than your first, make sure to choose the right one.
 This should be located on the right side of the page.
 This will take you to a list of all the custom pages you have on your Tumblr. Select "Add a page" from this menu.
 This is the address that people will have to type into the address bar to access your page, so it should probably be something like "bio" or "allaboutme". You'll also need to choose a layout for your page--either Standard, Custom, or Redirect (more about custom pages here).
 Format the text using the formatting tools above the box, then hit "Save".


Add your preferred name, gender, orientation and preferred pronouns first. It is important that you tell people who you are before they begin assuming things through lack of info. You may also want to add your country, race, age, star sign, birthday, religious beliefs or any other pieces of information that you want to tell someone first off. Let people know about the fandoms you are in, any interests that you have or skills that you might want to share.
If you have any skills that you would like to share, include these. Examples include translation, technology, art, editing, writing, scientific, mathematical and counselling skills. Don't be afraid to share these as you could end up helping a friend!

, You can do this by copying the code <a href="yourblogname.tumblr.com/yourbiolink">Click here for my bio!</a>. After you save your changes at the top of the page, it should look something like this.

 Use this measurement to create new tissues. (This will usually be a square shape.)

, Cut about 20 to 30 pieces of flannel, so that you can create an entire "tissue box" of reusable tissues.
 The pinking shears will help the flannel last longer without fraying as much. It's not foolproof, as fraying will occur over time, but it's a good start.


If you want to stitch a hem on each side, that's fine too. It'll take longer, that's all.
 They're now ready for use.
 Allow to dry either on the clothesline or in the dryer and reinsert into the box for the next use.

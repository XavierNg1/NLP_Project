 Spring cleaning usually makes you think about your overflowing winter wardrobe, so why not help the less privileged people by donating some lost loved items. Consider donating appliances, old furniture, tools, and anything else that you had been planning to replace anyway. Spring cleaning will seem more fun if you know what you donate will go to use.

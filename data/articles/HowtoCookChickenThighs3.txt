 Sprinkle the chicken evenly with salt and pepper.


If desired, you could also season the chicken with other spices and herbs. A dash of garlic powder, chili powder, onion powder, or Creole seasoning would work well for this recipe. If using a simpler butter or lemon sauce, rather than a barbecue sauce, a generous dash of parsley or oregano could work, as well.
 Use at least a 3 to 4 quart (3 to 4 liter) slow cooker and make sure that the lid is able to fit securely on top.


If desired, lightly coat the slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray or use nonstick slow cooker liners. These precautions are not necessary, but they can help to prevent chicken from getting stuck onto the side of the cooker.
 Whisk these ingredients together in a small bowl.


For added heat, consider whisking in up to 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) hot sauce.
Alternatively, you could also create a different sauce for the chicken to cook in if you do not like the taste of barbecue sauce. Just make sure that there is at least 3/4 cup (185 ml) liquid for the chicken to cook in. For instance, you could make a simple sauce with 1/2 cup (125 ml) chicken broth, 3 Tbsp (45 ml) butter, and 2 Tbsp (60 ml) lemon juice.
 Stir the chicken thighs to coat evenly.



The chicken should also be tender enough to fall apart without cutting.
 When finished cooking, remove the chicken from the slow cooker and place on a serving platter with the sauce or juices drizzled over it.

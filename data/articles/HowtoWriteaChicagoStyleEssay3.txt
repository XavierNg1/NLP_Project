 When writing your works cited page, use a line break between each reference but don’t double-space the references. Alphabetize your references by last name on the reference page.Also, leave two lines after the title of the section (either “Bibliography” or “References”).
 You will basically be using the same information for the reference page, minus the page number. However, the punctuation is a little different, and you begin with the last name of the author. For example:


“Victoire, Georgina. Robin’s Eggs. Atlanta, Georgia: Peaches and Cream Publishing, 1982.” As you can see, on the reference page, you use a period after the author, the title, and the date, and you remove the parenthesis. You don’t use the page number here because you are not citing a specific piece of information; you are referencing the book as a whole.
 You will use a similar style as a book with a journal article, beginning with the author’s name. However, instead of a book title, you follow the author’s name with the journal article title in quotation marks with a comma inside the quotation marks. Next, provide the journal’s title, volume number, a comma, and “no.” plus the issue number. Provide the year of publication in parenthesis, followed by a colon and the page numbers the article appears on in the journal. End with a period.For example: “Hodges, Livia. ‘The Joy of Plants,’ Biology for Geeks 25, no. 3 (2001): 24-68.”

, Use the DOI, or digital object finder, if you can find it. The DOI number is a digital reference number for journal articles, much as an ISBN works for books. Adding the date that you access the article is optional. For example:


“Hodges, Livia. ‘The Joy of Plants,’ Biology for Geeks 25, no. 3 (2001): 24-68. Accessed July 14, 2008. www.biology4geeks.com.”

 Think it's just for bathing little ones? The "tear free" baby shampoo is a great way to remove mascara (even waterproof), eyeshadow and eyeliner. Eye makeup removers can get pretty pricey (especially if you wear eye makeup frequently), so this is an affordable and a pain-free way to remove makeup. Without the burning!;
, Alternatively, you can dab some shampoo on a cotton ball and wipe it over your eyelids. Using cotton balls ensures that this process is a little more mess free.









If you'd like to only remove some of your makeup (you smudged it or made a mistake, for example), use a Q-tip! Just dab on some shampoo (or whatever you have at your disposal) on the necessary area. Then wipe it off with the other end of the Q-tip. Voila!

, Some foam will most likely appear. Keep your eyes closed so nothing gets in them. Even if it is "tear free" you don't want to take any risks!








, Just like you would any cleanser, grab your washcloth and gently wipe off the baby shampoo. Tada! Then gently wipe your face dry with a cloth towel.









If baby shampoo doesn't work for you or you don't have any on hand, try the methods discussed below!

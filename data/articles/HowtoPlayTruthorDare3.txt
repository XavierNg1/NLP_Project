 If you’re going to move around in a circle, do it as follows: player 1 will ask the question to the person on his or her left, player 2. Or you can choose a person to ask the first question (player 1), then he or she spins the bottle in the middle. Whoever the bottle lands on (player 2) will have to be the one answering or doing the dare.The exchange should go something like this:Player 1: “Truth or dare?”
Player 2: “Truth.”
Player 1: “When was the last time you ate your own snot?”
Player 2: “Ummm . . . . last Tuesday.”
OR
Player 1: “Truth or dare?”
Player 2: “Dare.”
Player 1: “Ok. You need to eat a tablespoon of hot sauce in less than 30 seconds.”
Player 2: “Yuck. Ok, here goes.”

, This will be the person who just answered the question or dare. He or she asks the person next in the circle, or spins the bottle to find the next person. Question as before. Continue playing until you can't go any more!

, Don't do anything illegal or life-threatening. If someone really doesn't want to do a dare, everyone in the game will pick a difficult dare of their own. The player then must choose one of the new dares. Choose wisely when electing to go to the alternate dares because they could be much worse. Remember, you don't have to do a dare if it's too much and surpasses the "limit" of what the group is playing for.

 Signs of heatstroke include excessive panting and rapid breathing, lethargy, bright pink ears, confusion, weakness and inability to stand, shaking, tremors, and possibly even seizures.A cat with heatstroke will also feel hot to the touch on the pads of her feet. If you suspect that your cat is suffering from heatstroke, place your cat on a cool surface right away, such as a tiled floor. Then turn on a fan and place it so that it is blowing on her to remove some of the heat.
 If your cat appears to be suffering from heatstroke, place cool damp washcloths over her paws and offer her some water to drink right away. If she is too weak to drink the water, try to moisten her gums with water using a damp cloth.


Avoid ice water or very cold water as the temperature difference between the extreme heat and extreme cold can send the cat into a form of shock.
 Your cat may need to be taken to see your veterinarian to treat her heatstroke. A veterinarian can provide intravenous fluids to reduce your cat’s core temperature and maintain the blood supply to her organs. As your cat’s temperature rises, her blood will become thicker and circulation to vital organs can be impaired.Call your cat’s veterinarian right away if you suspect that your cat is suffering from heatstroke.

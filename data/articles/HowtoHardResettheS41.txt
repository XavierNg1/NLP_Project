 This button is on the right side of the S4.
 This will force the S4 to turn off.,, If the S4 is still unresponsive, removing the battery will turn it off:

Flip the phone over so you're looking at the back.
Slide the back cover up and off.
Pull the battery out of the enclosure.
Reinsert the battery once the phone turns off and put the cover back on.

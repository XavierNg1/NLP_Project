 This is the golden rule for not attracting unwanted attention. If you talk, people will notice and you'll effectively be opening up the floodgates for conversation.;
, A smiling face will attract people. A frowning face might make people stare at you, wondering what in the world has you so depressed. An angry face will simply start trouble. Try to just keep a neutral facial pose, as it will be the least likely to bring about unsolicited stares and remarks.
 If you look someone else in the eyes, then they'll almost certainly notice. This doesn't mean, however, that you shouldn't glance over at people; it is actually recommended to glance over at everyone who walks by so you're aware of your surroundings. . . just don't stare into people's eyes.


Wearing sunglasses will help you here (granted it's bright enough outside to see). You can discreetly glance at people while they won't be able to see you looking at them.
 Obviously, don't wear any clothing that will attract the human eye (i.e. big flashy logos, bright colors, etc.). Stick with dark plain shirts, pants, and shoes.
 If you see someone heading your way, try to keep at least a few feet between you and the person. The more distance you put between yourself and the other person, the less likely they'll really notice you or attempt to talk to you.
 Keeping mobile is a good way to avoid random conversations. Although not totally necessary, it'll reduce the chance of a nosy stranger walking up to you than if you were standing on a street corner by yourself.

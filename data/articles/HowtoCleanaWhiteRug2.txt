 The quicker you address spills the better, so they have less time to absorb into carpet fibers. Scoop any semi-solid accidents and blot liquids up immediately with a white rag or a plain, white paper towel. Don’t use anything with prints, because it can bleed on your white rug., Many spills can be cleaned with plain water if they don’t have time to set in. Try to remove stains with water on rugs like wool first, because wool naturally deters liquids from absorbing and harsh cleaners can wear the fibers out. Rub spots with a water dampened sponge., For spills like coffee, juice or--yikes--red wine, mix together equal parts white vinegar and club soda to rub on the stain. Dip a clean rag into the solution, blot and rub it on the stain a little bit at a time until the spill disappears. Sponge a bit of water on the area afterwards to remove the vinegar and soda., Rubbing alcohol can clean up oil-based spills, like milk or cooking grease. Plus, it works its magic on ink spills. Dip a clean, white rag into alcohol a small amount at a time. Blot and lightly rub the alcohol onto the rug stain. Use a solution of one teaspoon dry dish detergent to one pint of water to flush the alcohol out and further remove the stain., A store-bought stain remover may have stronger chemicals in it that may be rough on your rug’s fibers, but it may be worth it if you’re dealing with tough stains like animal feces. Make sure you blot up as much liquid from the accident as possible before you apply a foam or spray-on stain remover.Follow directions given by the stain remover's manufacturer.

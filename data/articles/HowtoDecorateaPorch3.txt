 Most porches will already have a light wired in, but this may not be enough to fully light your newly decorated porch. Hire a professional to come inspect your porch and install lighting as needed. Before doing this, swap out your old porch bulb for a newer brighter one to see if that provides enough light for your needs., Hanging lights can give your porch a magical, comfortable feeling and are also very easy to install. Find the nearest outlet to your porch and use an extension cord if your lights cannot reach it. Install equally spaced hooks around your porch on either the overhanging roof or side railings. Hang the lights up and plug them in whenever it gets dark.
 Small garden lights can be installed in either your planter boxes or around the edge of your porch. They will only provide a minor to moderate amount of light, but it is better than being in complete darkness. You can also install tiki torches around the edges of your porch for a fun and unique vibe.


The advantage to using torches is that you can use bug repellent fuel to discourage undesired bugs from bothering you and your guests.

 Locker walls are great for decorations as a lot of pictures can be doodled or drawn quickly or with a click of a button, be printed off the internet. If you can find a small figurine then it can be placed on top of some books or in a free corner of your locker., Make sure the budget isn't too big but make sure its not too small either. Reuse old decorations from your home or your neighbors homes.

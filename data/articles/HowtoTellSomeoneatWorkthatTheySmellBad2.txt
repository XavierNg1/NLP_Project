 When someone at work smells bad, they usually don’t know it. And if they don’t know it, they likely don’t know how to correct the problem. Offer helpful comments regarding the potential cause and possible suggestions for how to deal with the problem.For instance, you might say, “Perhaps you just need to wash your clothes more often. Or maybe you could try showering more frequently.”

, If, after telling someone at work they smell bad, they do not take reasonable and appropriate steps to freshen up, you should report the issue to a workplace superior. With luck, they will have more success than you did in correcting the coworker’s stench., If you’re in a management position and the person at work who smells bad is combative or disagrees with you, insist that they must come to work smelling fresh. Remind them that stinky workers reflect badly on the business and that failing to correct their foul odor could hurt their relationships with their coworkers.Say, for instance, “We have a company policy that requires all workers to be fresh and clean at work.”

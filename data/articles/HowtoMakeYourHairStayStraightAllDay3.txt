 This encourages the hair to dry in a straight direction. You can even use brush or comb to guide and hold your hair as you dry.
 The hotter and stronger the air flowing from the hair dryer, the more likely you are to have frizzy, fly-away hair after you are done drying. Be patient and use the least abrasive settings to achieve smooth hair.
 This not only protects your hair from the heat, but also encourages your hair to adhere to the straightness of the flat iron.
 Ceramic flat irons are generally the most effective and least damaging to your hair. Take your hair in small chunks and run the straightening iron from the roots to the tips all around your head.
 Make sure the air intensity is also on the lowest setting possible and guide your hair with a thick brush, combing on the inside of your hair with the bristles pointing toward the blow-dryer.

 This, in turn, will determine clientele you wish to serve.


Consider large corporations that can depend on you to run errands outside of their offices and small business owners who may have to close their doors whenever they need to run an errand themselves.
Think of clinics and medical buildings where there is no cafeteria. You can provide a service to them by making a lunch delivery every day.
Remember that there are many elderly persons at home or in a retirement village who would cherish a dependable errand gofer.;
, Make the route small enough that you have plenty of time to cover it within a half or full day's time. Leave yourself enough time to take new clients in that area. Map out several routes if you plan to become a gofer in a large city, or if you plan to cover several small towns.
 Consider having magnetic cards made for those people who tend to misplace loose papers and business cards. Consider making some letterhead, as well.
 Introduce yourself and your gofer service.


Try to speak to the highest-level person possible. Leave one or more business cards and perhaps a letter of introduction in case you don't get far up the ladder on the first visit.
Promise to check back with those who are not sure whether the company needs your services. Keep the promise and check back in a few days.
 Consider how much business you may have on any particular day. Check with promising clients to see if they would need your service every day, or just one or two days a week. Leave some time each day for emergency runs or unexpected problems.
 Decide what to do if you become ill or are unable to do the job for one day or a longer period of time. Consider having a backup person or a partner, and make sure your clients meet this person ahead of time.

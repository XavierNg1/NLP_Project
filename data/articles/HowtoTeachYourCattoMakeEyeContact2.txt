Begin noticing the times when your cat makes eye contact with you, such as when they want some food. Keep some cat treats with you and wait for the eye contact to occur., Whenever the cat makes eye contact with you, reinforce this behavior with a simple verbal cue. Try saying "watch" every time your cat makes eye contact with you., After you've provided the verbal cue, give your cat a reward for eye contact. You can praise them verbally by saying "good job," as well as offering a treat., After a while, you will hopefully be able to anticipate times when your cat is going to make eye contact with you. Try to speak the verbal cue just before the cat looks at you. Continue to offer rewards for eye contact. Eventually, you should be able to compel eye contact from your cat simply by speaking the verbal cue.

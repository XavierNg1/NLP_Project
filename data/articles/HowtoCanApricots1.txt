 Use honey or sugar to create a light to medium syrup to preserve the apricots inside the can.For every 1 qt (1 L) of water, add 2 cups (500 ml) sugar for a light syrup or 3 cups (750 ml) for a medium syrup.
If using honey, for every 1 qt (1 L) of water, add 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) honey for a light syrup or 2 cups (500 ml) for a medium syrup.
Boil the sweetener and water together in a saucepan until the sugar or honey dissolves. Then reduce the syrup to a low heat, keeping it at a simmer.
Alternatively, you could also use apple juice or white grape juice instead of a syrup.;
, Quickly remove the skins by blanching the fruit in boiling water.


Boil water in a medium saucepan.
Dunk the apricots in the boiling water for 2 minutes.
Immediately transfer the apricots to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking.
Slip the skins off with your fingers.
 Use a kitchen knife to cut each apricot in half. Remove the pits, and if desired, cut the apricots into serving-size slices. Place them directly in the still-simmering syrup to prevent them from discoloring or darkening.


Once the apricots are inside the syrup, let them continue simmering until heated through. Give it 2 to 4 minutes to do so.
You will need 16 lb (7.2 kg) of fruit to create 7 qt (7 L) of canned fruit. For 9 pints (4.25 L), you will need about 10 lb (4.5 kg).
 Ladle the apricots and syrup into each jar, leaving about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at that top of each jar. Screw on the lids, making sure that they are as tight as possible.


Place the fruit inside the jars cut-side-down, if possible, so more fruit will fit inside each jar.
As the apricots undergo the canning process, the contents of the jar will expand. If you do not leave enough headspace at the top of the jar, the lid may not seal properly or the glass may even break.
Make sure the jars are clean and sanitized before use. The lids should also be clean and sterilized.
 Use canning tongs to lower each jar into your canner carefully. Make sure the jars do not clink together as you arrange them, since doing so can cause the glass to break. You can use a boiling-water canner, dial-gauge pressure canner, or weighted-gauge pressure canner, but the amount of processing time will vary depending on which method you use.For boiling-water canners:

Pints should be processed for 20 minutes at altitudes between 0 and 1000 feet (0 to 305 m), 25 minutes between 1001 and 3000 feet (305 to 915 m), 30 minutes at altitudes between 3001 and 6000 feet (915 to 1830 m), and 35 minutes above 6000 feet (1830 m).
Quarts should be processed for 25 minutes at altitudes between 0 and 1000 feet (0 to 305 m), 30 minutes between 1001 and 3000 feet (305 to 915 m), 35 minutes at altitudes between 3001 and 6000 feet (915 to 1830 m), and 40 minutes above 6000 feet (1830 m).


When using a dial-gauged pressure canner, process both pints and quarts for 10 minutes. Use a pressure of 6 PSI for altitudes between 0 and 2000 feet (0 and 610 m), 7 PSI between 2001 and 4000 feet (610 and 1220 m), 8 PSI between 4001 and 6000 feet (1220 and 1830 m), and 9 PSI between 6001 and 8000 feet (1830 and 2440 m).
When using a weighted-gauge pressure canner, process both pints and quarts for 10 minutes. Use a pressure of 5 PSI between 0 and 1000 feet (0 and 305 m) and 10 PSI for anything above 1001 feet (305 m).</ref>

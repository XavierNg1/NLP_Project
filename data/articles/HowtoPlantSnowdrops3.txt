 Due to the fact that snowdrops are an early blooming flower, it’s common for a late frost to do some damage to them. Winter plants, like snowdrops, are usually able to recover from such shocks naturally with enough time.If you’re concerned your snowdrops might be damaged by a heavy frost or cold snap, lay down some groundcover to protect them, like a layer of hay or a blanket.
When using groundcover like a blanket, be careful not to crush new growth. Remember to remove your blanket in the morning so your plants receive sun.
 Squirrels are the most common pest to plague freshly planted bulbs.These animals can be difficult to keep away from your plantings. Play music or have a radio running around bulbs to scare off squirrels, or spray a squirrel repellant around your plants.


Predator urine is a common kind of squirrel repellant. It’s available at many home and garden centers and hardware stores.
 If your snowdrops start to die or are looking unhealthy, you may be overwatering them. Snowdrops require only light to moderate watering, and overwatering can cause plants to die or become diseased.


Soil that is too damp can also cause fungi or mold to grow on the bulb or roots of snowdrops. Fungi and mold are dangerous to the health of your snowdrops., Fungus can usually be detected in snowdrops when bulbs fail to emerge or the plant collapses amidst a white colored growth. Mold is present when the leaves and flowers of your plants are covered in fuzzy, gray substance. In both cases, you should remove and destroy infected plants/bulbs.


There are no chemical treatments to remedy these common snowdrop ailments. Your best option, if you have a fungi or mold outbreak, is to separate and destroying the diseased plants.
By adequately spacing your and watering your plants, you can reduce the chances of your plants catching these afflictions.

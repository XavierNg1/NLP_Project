 Choose an acrylic latex semi-gloss, a gloss enamel or an oil-based semi-gloss paint. Paints designed for use on metal will resist rust and will be more durable than traditional wall paints.
 Sheet metal paint is available in both spray paint and brush-on options. Both types of paint work well for home decorating purposes.

Choose a brush or roller size appropriate for your sheet metal project. If the sheet metal is large, select a wide brush or roller; if the sheet metal is small, choose a smaller brush or roller. For best paint control, hold the brush at the base of the handle near the bristles.






Apply 2 coats of the paint, allowing the first coat to dry completely before applying the second coat.


Shake the spray paint can vigorously for 1 or 2 minutes before painting the sheet metal.






Test the nozzle before applying paint to the sheet metal. Spray a small amount of paint on a newspaper or piece of cardboard to ensure the nozzle is working correctly and sprays paint evenly.






Apply spray paint to the sheet metal. Hold the spray paint can 12 to 24 inches (30.4 to 60.9 cm) from the surface. Spray in a quick, smooth and even pattern until the surface is covered. For best results, keep the can parallel to the sheet metal surface and spray in a back and forth motion over the surface.

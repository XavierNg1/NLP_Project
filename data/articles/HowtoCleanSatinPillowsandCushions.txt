 Start the cleaner and move the brush gently over each pillow or cushion to remove all dust, fluff, etc. Be careful around ornamental parts of the pillow.;
, If there are stains on any of the pillows or cushions, these should be treated with spot cleaning focused just on the stain:


Sprinkle flour or talcum powder over the stain.
Leave the cushion or pillow sitting stain face-up overnight.
The next day, brush off the excess that hasn't soaked in. The stain should be removed.
 If you cannot remove a stain using the method suggested previously, you could try laundering a cushion or pillow that has a removable cover. Use gentle washing liquid and do this by hand.

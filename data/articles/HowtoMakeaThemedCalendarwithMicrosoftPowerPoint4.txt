 This tutorial uses Microsoft Powerpoint, but you can probably use other programs.


This article uses a picture of a snowflake but choose what you want and what matches your theme.
 Click on the image and duplicate it a couple of time.


You can duplicate them by right clicking the image and pressing "Copy". After that paste a couple of times and you should have many images.
 Place the images with space between them so that you can see each image and bevel them. You can actually just make one image and bevel that and then duplicate. But you may want to try different types of bevel, so the more the better.


By going to home and then going left to "Shape Effects" you can find the bevel and other effects.
 Add some rotation, reflection and glow. These add emphasis to the image and make things look more sophisticated.
 For example a heart or star.


You can get shapes by going to "Insert" and clicking on the tab that says shapes.
 The star is going to be recoloured yellow and the heart is going to be red.


Click on the image and go to "Format" if you want to give the shapes more personalized care if not then you are finished.

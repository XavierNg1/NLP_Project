 Conditioner makes hair smooth and silky, but when you're trying to hold curls, you want a rougher, dryer texture. If your hair is too slippery, it won't hold curl. When you wash your hair, rinse out the shampoo and skip the conditioner altogether., This product is actually made for people with curly hair, but it works great for straight-haired people who want to add curl, too. Use a dime or quarter-sized amount, depending on the length of your hair. Comb it through your hair from the roots to the tips to distribute the product evenly.


If you don't have curl cream, you can use gel or mousse instead. Don't add too much product to your hair, since you could end up weighing it down. Too much product will cause the curls to fall out instead of staying in place.
 There are many methods used to curl wet hair without using any type of heat. You can have shiny, glossy, well-shaped curls or waves without using a curling iron; you just need some extra time. Try one of these popular methods to get the look you want:


Create pin curls
Make sock bun curls
Curl hair with an old t-shirt

, No matter which curling method you use, the secret is to let your hair completely dry. You can help it along by blowing the pinned-up curls with a blow dryer. Alternatively, sleep on the curls and let them dry overnight.


Unpin one curl to test and see if they're dry. If the curl is still wet inside, pin it back up and wait few more hours, then try again.
 Remove the pins, t-shirt-strips or socks that helped you curl your hair, and let your curls down gently. Avoid combing or brushing them, since this can cause them to fall out right away., Use a medium or strong-hold spray to finish the look and hold your curls in place for the rest of the day. Remember to avoid touching your hair too much, since puling on the curls can make them fall out faster.

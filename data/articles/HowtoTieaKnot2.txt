Make two loops of equal size stacked on top of each other. Take the end of the rope farthest from the two loops (end A) and wrap it over your tie-in point (wrap it from the back over to the front.)
Thread end A through the hole created by the two loops. Wrap end A around the other end (end B) that is shorter and near the two loops.
Thread end A back through the two loops, making sure that it is wrapped around end B.
 The re-threaded figure-eight knot, also called a figure-of-eight follow-through, is used by climbers to tie into a harness.








Make a loop in the rope so that there is about five feet (1.5 meters) of loose rope at one end (end A). Make the loop so that end A wraps around the bottom of the loop and over the rest of the rope (end B.)
Thread end a through the loop and pull tight. This should form a figure-eight in the rope where the loop was. Loop end A through your harness.
Thread end A through the top loop of the figure-eight. Wrap end A around end B and pull end a up through the bottom of the figure-eight, loop it over the top of end B and back through the top of the figure-eight so that it comes out the bottom of the figure-eight.
 Prusik knots are used to tie a loop around a rope so that a rope can be climbed. It is a classic ascending knot that is often used for self-rescue.








Take a small rope or chord (rope A) and pull it under the rope you want to climb (rope B.) Form a loop with rope A and pull the loop over rope B. The two ends of rope A should hang down under rope B.
Pull the loop over rope B and around again so that it is back up on the other side. Repeat this step three to five times, depending on the thickness of your rope.
Bring the ends of rope A through the loop. Doing this will secure rope A to rope B. When you pull on the ends of rope A, the knot will stay in place. When you loosen the knot, the knot will be able to slide up and down rope B.

 There are certain chores and household tasks that need to be performed on daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. Determine what those tasks are, who will be assisting with those tasks, and when. Then make sure that everyone involved adheres to the schedule. If there is in-home help or assisted living, many of these tasks will already be taken care of.
 Plan finances ahead of time so that the senior citizen is prepared for incidentals and emergencies. Make time to sit down with them and lay out a plan. It is best to be prepared and know what to expect so that a senior citizen is not taken by surprise or left with nothing. Review the state of the senior citizen’s finances with him or her. Determine their income, what assets they possess, what bills need to be paid, and what debts are owed.
Create a realistic budget and financial plan that the senior citizen understands and can stick to.
 Planning out a schedule for senior citizens will prevent them from becoming bored, will give them something to look forward to, and will prevent depression. Whether it be a hobby that they enjoy, lunch with friends or family, or a game of cards, a schedule will make a senior citizen’s life more pleasant.


Talk to the senior citizen and find out what they want to do more of. If they want to do things like visit friends more often, then schedule some time to visit with friends. Incorporate their favorite activities in the schedule so that they can look forward to something every day.

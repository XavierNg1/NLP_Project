 Put the prepared mayonnaise and hot sauce in a glass bowl and whisk together, vigorously, until evenly combined.


One very popular spicy mayo is made with sriracha.Keep in mind, many people may find this chili sauce to be extremely spicy. Taste test after you mix your mayo up to determine if you should add more chili, or perhaps water it down by adding more mayo.
Keep whisking until the ingredients are completely combined. There should be no streaks of hot sauce running through the mayo. Instead, the color should be completely uniform.;
, Drizzle the lemon juice into the spicy mayo and whisk well to combine.


Lemon juice is not necessary, but if you sample the spicy mayo and decide that it is too hot for your preference, adding a little lemon juice can help cut down on some of the heat.
Since the lemon juice will be harder to see than the hot sauce, you will need to make a rough estimate about whether or not the juice has been completely mixed in. Do this by mixing it in for approximately as long as you mixed in the hot sauce.
 Cover your new condiment with plastic wrap or a lid and leave it in your refrigerators until you are ready to use it.


The finished mayo will be a little thinner than standard mayo.
If using the spicy mayo for sushi, you can pipe it through a pastry bag or a plastic bag with a small hole in the bottom. Squeeze a thin drizzle or trail of spicy mayo over the dish to spread the heat.

 Plan it well, you don't have to run this charity everyday. Three times a year is good, and loads of people will come and help because it will not always be there too often. Make the dates apart.;
, Choose people who are willing to do it; some friends will do it and then give up, it's annoying. Choose people who are going to help make a change.
 Make a team name, maybe 'Warm Hearted' or 'Caring Friends', they seem very professional. Talk to the team. Bring a pen and paper and write down charity events and where this will be held. Work out which charity you are going to help.
 Ask a teacher about talking to your school and asking pupils to bring old things that look good to sell, but nothing too old! Check the things before you put them on sell. Some people put in rubbish things and also stuff you can not use. Try having people donate old coats, shoes, toys, books, stuffed animals, and canned food.
 Put a painted banner up. It should say the name of your team, and have clothes, books, videos and games stored nicely where the event will be held.
 Some people will notice and will want to see them and have a look. Some will look but not come.
 Have a sell of things but also hold out a box where money can be kept in for the charity. A good idea is to hold, for example, a bake sale, and donate all the money to the charity.
 After the event, send out other flyers saying how you would like to thank people who made it and tell people how much you raised and when the next event will be.

 Draw a medium-sized circle and then, on the upper right side of the circle, draw an angled cone shape. Draw a small scalene triangle at the end of the cone.



 ;
, It should somewhat resemble the shape of a bowling pin.
 One oval should be overlapping the body on the right side. Draw it tilted it a bit to the left. For the other oval, draw it between the head and body, on the left side of the sketch. Make sure the oval is overlapping the head a little bit.
 These with be the hands. For the legs, draw a small, tilted rectangle at the bottom left side of the body oval. Draw a small rectangle right on top of it.
 The right oval should be slightly smaller, and overlapping the left oval (which will be in front).
 Above the lower arm, draw one small oval pointing downward. Above that oval and below the head, draw another small oval, this one pointing upward.
 On the body draw half of a small diamond upon the left side of the body oval, right next to the lowered arm. For Celebi's antennae, draw two thin, long banana shapes in the middle of the circle. Lastly, for eyes, draw a medium-sized, almost egg-shaped oval near the bottom of the circle. Within that draw a slightly smaller egg shape. Draw a circle inside of that, and on the other side of the head draw a vertical, thin oval. Don't forget to draw a small smile below the two of them!

, Erase all the sketch lines after. Feel free to curve lines, thin them down, etc. (it takes a little while to get a drawing perfect, but it's always worth the effort in the end).
 The main colors of Celebi would be a light colors, except for the black around the eyes--beige, green, and blue are its usual hues.

 In general, female Bettas are less colorful than male Bettas. In addition, the female Betta tails are not as long or showy as those on male Bettas. In fact, the female Betta tail is more likely to be round.Because young male Bettas do not have long fins, fin shape cannot be reliably used to determine sex in young Bettas., The beard is not an actual beard. – It is a membrane under the gill cover. In males, it can be seen when the gill covers are closed or open. Female Bettas also have a beard, but it is visible only when the gill covers are open.Male Bettas flare (open their gill covers and expand their beard) to make themselves look bigger to another male Betta., The small white dot is present only on females. It is the ovipositor or ova—the location where a female produces her eggs. This small white dot is more apparent in an adult female Betta.The ova may be difficult to identify in a young female Betta, making it more challenging to determine the sex.

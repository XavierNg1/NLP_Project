 Swat a fly by trapping it between one hand and a hard, flat surface that you have gotten it to land on. Move slowly toward the fly, then slap it quickly and firmly with your hand.


Approach the fly very slowly until you are within an armâ€™s length of it. Keep your arm still until you are in position, then move it as quickly as possible in one motion toward the fly to hit it.
If you are approaching the fly from behind it, anticipate its quick forward motion by aiming your hand slightly (a few inches) in front of it for the slap. If you are coming at the fly from the front, arc your hand over and slightly behind the fly in case it flies backwards.;
, Lift up one finger on your swatting hand using your other hand (the pointer or middle finger works best). Then position that hand flat on the surface that your fly is on, then release your finger to snap it down and hit the fly at a quick rate.Move your hand very, very slowly until it is in position on the flat surface that the fly has already landed on. Make sure the finger you have pulled back is in perfect position over the fly before you release it.
Because this method requires you to place your hand so close, it may not work with quickly-moving flies. Try it on flies that have slowed down due to age, colder weather, or time of day.
 Approach a fly slowly with two hands on either side of it, palms facing toward the fly. Then bring your palms quickly together as if you were clapping to trap the fly between them.


Aim a few inches above the fly when you bring your hands together to anticipate it escaping upward.Use a variation of this method if you want to humanely capture a fly and release it outside without killing it. Instead of bringing your two palms together, make one of both of your hands into a cupped position before bringing them together to catch the fly in the space made between your hands.

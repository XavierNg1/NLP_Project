 This is a material that looks like fabric lining in a tape shape. It can be found at almost every sewing shop. All you have to do is pin it into place and iron: the material melts and acts like glue.
 You'll want to avoid using tulle for this style. You want a fabric with fibers that are closer together, so that the glue of the seam tape has something to hold on to. Organza will work better with the seam tape and it still has the ballet look. It is, however, often more expensive than tulle.
 Cut panels of fabric that are as long as you want the skirt to be plus 2.5 inches (6 centimeters). The width depends on you: having wider panels makes for fewer visible gaps in the skirt, but having narrower ones makes the panels easier to add onto the waist band. How many panels you want is also up to you. You can add as many or as few a you want. The more you have, the more volume the skirt will have.
 Cut strips of the seam tape to the width of your panels. Then, fold over the top of the panel so that there is about 2.5 inches (6 centimeters) of overlap. Run the seam tape between the layers and pin it into place as close to the bottom edge as possible. You want to leave a channel at the top to run the waist band through.
 Follow the instructions for your seam tape and iron the seam of each panel.
 Using a ribbon or elastic band as a waistband, thread the panels onto the waistband one at a time. A pencil can help with this. When you like how full your skirt looks, just tie it on your waist like an apron! Enjoy!

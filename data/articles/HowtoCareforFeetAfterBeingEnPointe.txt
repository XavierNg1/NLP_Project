 Feel for any abnormal pain to check you haven't injured yourself. Walking normally will get your feet back into 'normal mode', so you hopefully won't be walking around turned out.;
, Or get a can and lay in horizontal position. Roll through your demi-pointe a couple times, take a couple of plies, and a couple of tendus.Rolling helps to break up adhesions in the muscle.
 Start with your toes, since they'll probably be the most painful part of your feet after pointe class. Work your way through the balls of your feet, though your arch, and into your heel. Rub with a circular motion, and dig gently with your fingers to massage tendons, ligaments and muscles.
 Massage them again while in the water to help with the feeling of soreness. Leave them in the water while you watch television or read a book.
 It doesn't matter what brand it is, but lotions with aloe vera or other soothing or healing herbs in can really help mend your feet if they got cut or sore during practice. Arnica cream is good to use on bruising.
 Wriggle your toes about and tap out a rhythm with your big toe to restore your movement.
 Continue to work on the strengthening of your feet and ankles so that your next time on pointe is less painful and so you advance in your skill on pointe. It won't get better immediately since pointe is a hard skill to learn and it isn't kind on the body. The stronger you are, the easier pointe will be. Make sure you attend technique lessons in soft shoes as well as pointe training so your skill in ballet doesn't slip. Do another form of exercise as well as dance to improve your leg strength, like running or swimming.

 Although you may not be excited about transferring, try to have a positive attitude about the change. Focus on the positive aspects of changing schools. Over time, you'll stop thinking about it so much and will just enjoy being at the new school.As soon as you find yourself thinking something negative, change it to a positive statement. For example, instead of saying, "This is never going to work," say, "I think I need to approach this differently."

, If you're unhappy about having to transfer schools, it can be easy to only see the negatives of your new school. Try not to compare your new school to your old school. Remind yourself that you're in a new place and need a new start with new opportunities. Comparing the schools will only hold you back.Realize that your school experience will be unique to you. One school or set of experiences isn't better than any other.
 Just as it took you time to adjust to your old school, you'll also need to give yourself time to adjust to the new school. To help with some of the little things, try to walk through the school or campus before classes start. This way, you can figure out where your classes are ahead of time.


It can also be useful to know how meal plans work, where you can park (if you drive to school), and where the main offices are (for guidance, financial, and academic advising).
 If you're still struggling to find your place in a new school or you feel lonely or isolated, there are resources for you. Visit your school's guidance counselor or transfer support center. Trained professionals can talk with you about your concerns and help you adapt to life in a new school.


Your school can also put you in touch with other transfer students or peer mentors who are going through similar situations as you.

 If you can remember that 1 mm = 125.4{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{25.4}}} inches, that's great. But this conversion doesn't come up very often. It's more useful to memorize these common conversions:

1 cm = about 0.4 inches

1 cm = 10 mm

1 inch = exactly 2.54 cm (you don't need this for this conversion, but it's a good one to know)


, This is easy to do in your head. Just divide the millimeter measurement by 10. All you have to do is move the decimal point one digit to the left. If you're not sure why this works, look at this example:

430 mm= 430 mm x 1cm10mm{\displaystyle {\frac {1cm}{10mm}}}= 43 cm.
 The 1 cm = 0.4 in is close enough for most purposes. But how do you multiply by 0.4 in your head? Here are two different ways to do it, continuing with the same example:

Divide by two, then subtract 1/10 of the cm value: 43 cm ÷ 2 = 21.5→ 1/10 of 43 is 4.3→ subtract the second number from the first: 21.5 - 4.3 = 17.2 in.


Or divide by ten, then multiply by four:43 cm ÷ 10 = 4.3→ 4.3 x 4 = (4 x 4) + (0.3 x 4) = 16 + 1.2 = 17.2 in.
 Learning how to do this will come in handy for quick real-life estimates, where the exact answer is usually not important. It's not a good idea for homework problems that require an exact answer, but you can use it to double check your answer and make sure it's in the right ballpark.

In the example, the exact answer is actually 16.921 inches. The estimate is less than a third of an inch off, which is pretty good for mental math.

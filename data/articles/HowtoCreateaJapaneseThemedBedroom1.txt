, Put tatami mats, which are woven straw mats, over the current flooring in your bedroom. Purchase them online or at a furniture store near you. Before you buy them, measure your room to see how many you need and of what size. Typically, they are about 3 feet by 6 feet.Tatami mats will complement almost any kind of flooring, but they look especially good with wood floors and earth tones. If you have a bright carpet or another type of floor that does not match tatami mats, consider replacing your floor.
If you cannot afford to put tatami mats in your entire room, put them in pertinent places in the room, such as near the bed or in a seating area., Choose a color for the walls that is warm and relaxing. The wall color should be simple, not distracting. If you so choose, consider adding a bamboo accent wall. You can later accent them with bright splashes of color, such as red, gold, or pink. The goal is to create a soothing ambiance, almost like the feeling one gets from viewing nature., If the architecture of your room allows, take out your current door. Japanese-inspired sliding doors typically have wood frames covered with either paper (so that they are opaque) or glass (either frosted or clear).If you cannot accomodate a sliding door, choose a Japanese-inspired swinging door.
 Natural light is important for the style of the room. Try to leave the windows completely without ornamentation or cover, if you can. If you need to cover the windows, use silk curtains in warm, neutral colors or rice paper or bamboo blinds.

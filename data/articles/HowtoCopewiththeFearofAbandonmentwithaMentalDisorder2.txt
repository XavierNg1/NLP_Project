 Look for a therapist you feel safe and comfortable with. They should have experience working with people who have your mental disorder. Making progress is easier when you have a good rapport with your therapist.You may need to visit several different therapists before you find one who is a good fit for you.
 Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy. It teaches people the skills they need to change negative thoughts and behaviors, which can help with overcoming the fear of abandonment.Dialectical behavior therapy is often very successful at treating borderline personality disorder.
 Speak with your therapist about seeking group support. There may be groups for people with your specific disorder, and you may also benefit from a group like Codependents Anonymous (CoDA) or AlAnon. These groups will help you build healthy connections with others, as well as connect you with helpful resources and literature., Depending on your mental disorder, medication may be an option for helping to manage your symptoms. Talk to your doctor about whether itâ€™s a good choice for you.If you suffer from anxiety or depression in addition to another mental disorder, medication may be helpful in managing these conditions. Ask your doctor about anti-anxiety meds like benzodiazepines and antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to learn more.
Be aware that benzodiazepines in particular can be very addictive and should be used in the short-term with extreme caution.
Remember that medication is not a replacement for healthy coping strategies and lifestyle changes. If your doctor determines that medication would be helpful for you, you should still work with a therapist to treat the underlying issues that lead to your fear of abandonment.

 When was the last time you did a 'valuable friends' audit? What do you mean? I hear you cry. I mean have you ever taken the time to re-evaluate your friendships? Are there people around you that are constantly negative, pour cold water over your positive ideas, are miserable and fickle? Are these the kind of people that can help you to grow in confidence? Challenge: be honest about the value of the friends you have and make some bold decisions. Reason: to remove yourself from negative influences and environments.
 Have someone in your group (or circle) that you admire for their skills or their achievements. Observe the way they handle conflict, face new challenges and communicate with people. Challenge: Attend a club/association/group associated with a hobby/topic you are interested in. Reason: to meet new people that are different to your current circle of friends

 For instance, a yew log can yield experience points for buyers who want to stretch bows, or it can be used to make fires. Items with more flexible uses will always be in demand.
 You want to trade items that people cannot access as easily, but you also want to avoid low supplies of rare items. Also, you want items that everyone needs, not just items for a niche of highly-skilled players.
 Because buy limits will only allow you to purchase a certain number of items per day, buy something that is more expensive as opposed to a cheaper item. A 5 percent return on 1,000GP is not as high as a 5% return on 10,000 GP. Just be sure not to spend all of your assets on 1 item.
 If you want to buy and hold, pick items that rise gradually in price. If you want to take a risk, buy an item that fluctuates rapidly in price. Just remember that more volatility means both more chance for wealth and more risk for loss.

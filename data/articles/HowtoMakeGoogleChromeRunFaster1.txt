 Look for Google Chrome on your computer and open it. The web browser will load.;
, Type in “chrome://plugins/” on the address bar and press Enter on your keyboard. The Plug-ins page will load.


Here you can see all the plug-ins you currently have on your Chrome. Scroll down the page to see more.
 Go through your plug-ins one by one and check if it’s something you want to keep. If it’s something you rarely use, it will be better to just disable it.
 When you find a plug-in you’d like to disable, click the Disable link right below the plug-in name. The disabled plug-in will be grayed out.

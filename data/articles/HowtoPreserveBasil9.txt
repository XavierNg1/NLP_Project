 Do this when they're just dried from dew but have not yet had the sun's heat on them. You'll need about 2 dozen leaves for this recipe.


Wash, clean and dry as needed.
 Pack loosely.
 Cover the leaves and fill the jar about 4/5ths.
 Put the covered jar into the refrigerator for 24 hours to infuse. Leave as long as you like beyond this time, as the flavor will simply continue to intensify.
 Strain the basil leaves out when using the vodka. You can simply add them back to the unused vodka to keep infusing but don't include them in your cocktails or neat vodka drink as the flavors are now in the liquid.

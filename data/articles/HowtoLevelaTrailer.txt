 In most cases, the landing gear is operated with a simple hand crank. Making sure the gear is touching the ground before attempting to make any adjustments will add some stability to the trailer and provide a better idea if any adjustments are needed at all.
 This can be accomplished by placing the carpenter's level on the floor of the trailer. Check the leveling from side-to-side first, and then reposition the level to check from front-to-back. Doing so makes it easier to determine which corners of the trailer will require some attention., Doing so will often make it possible to quickly achieve and even balance from all angles, or at least reduce the amount of leveling that must be achieved using additional resources., Use a trailer jack to lift the side that is at an undesirable height. Then slide a section of wooden planking into the gap between the nearest support in the gear mechanism and the ground level. Place a chock under the nearest wheel to prevent any slipping. Lower the jack, and use the level to make sure the angle is now balanced., Start with the end of the trainer that is lower, and use the jack to lift that end to the desired height. Use the carpenter's level to double-check the angle. If the balance from front-to-back is ideal, use short sections of wood planks to build up the area between the ground and the bottom of the gear mechanisms. Secure the trailer tires with the aid of the chocks., Using the carpenter's level, take a second look at the balance from side-to-side and then from front-to-back a second time. Placing the level in the middle area of the trailer floor will make it easier to determine if the overall balance is within acceptable limits. If the balance is acceptable, make sure the planks and chocks are firmly in position.

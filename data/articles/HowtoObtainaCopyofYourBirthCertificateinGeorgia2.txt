 Georgia offers a copy of the vital records request form online, which you can print and fill out. You could also pick up a copy of the same form at your county vital records office.


You'll need your full name, address, date and place of birth (including the city, county and hospital), and the full name of your mother and father to complete the request form.
 Georgia requires a photo ID such as a driver’s license or passport as proof of identification.
 Georgia charges $25 for each certified copy of a birth certificate. If you’re ordering a copy through the mail, you can only pay with a certified check or money order made payable to “Vital Records.”, If requesting through the mail, your documents should be mailed to Vital Records, 2600 Skyland Drive, NE, Atlanta, GA 30319.
 Unlike ordering online, you cannot pay to expedite shipping if you place your order through the mail.

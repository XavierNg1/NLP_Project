 Strive to be a role model at school with positive feedback from students and teachers alike.;
, Know your capabilities and areas needing improvement.
, Don't just hear, learn how to listen. Peer counseling is all about listening skills.
 Keep information confidential but before doing any peer counseling explain the exceptions to confidentiality--danger to self or others in particular. Never agree to keep a secret but agree that you will keep things confidential. There is a big difference. Always make sure to get supervision from the school counselor and discuss any concerns with them as soon as possible.

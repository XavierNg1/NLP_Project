 Before you move into your new apartment building or rented home, find out about the smoking policy. If you are living in an apartment, find out if the building is smoke-free or if people can smoke in their apartments.Ask about the previous tenants’ smoking habits. Ask if anyone has smoked in your apartment or home previously.
Find out if there are smoke-free floors or sections in your apartment building.
 Consider discussing your concerns about the smoking policy in your apartment building with your landlord. Ask if they will consider instituting a no-smoking policy in your building. There are many options available to landlords that they can access at the website for the Americans for Non-Smokers’ Rights.If that is not possible, you can ask your landlord to follow the recommendations of the ANR. If your landlord won’t, you can do this instead. You may want to keep receipts and a time-log. You may have legal options to have your landlord pay for the work as well.
 Talk to your landlord about updating your home to remove any thirdhand smoke. If your landlord won’t do that, then do it yourself. The walls and ceilings should be thoroughly washed with detergent and hot water. Gloves should be worn and either disposable towels or many clean rags should be used. Wash the walls, and then rinse at least twice.


Repaint the walls with at least one to two coats of paint.
Replace carpeting. If this is too expensive, shampoo the rugs and carpets at least three to five times using hot water and replacing the cleaning solution often.
Replace the curtains, blinds, and any window treatments.
Clean out ventilation ducts and replace all the filters.

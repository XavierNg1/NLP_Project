 This is how you decide first possession of the ball or which goal end each team starts in. Whoever did not toss the coin calls the coin while it is in the air. If it lands on what they called, they get the ball. You can also do a throw up. A player from each team stands opposite each other, facing the way they are shooting, a metre away from each other. The coach or Umpire then tosses the ball up in between them and the first one to catch the ball decides whether they want the first center pass or they can choose which way they want to shoot. , The Center (C) stands in the center circle and passes the ball to a teammate standing in the center third of the court. After each goal is scored, play resumes with another center pass.
 You can score a goal by shooting the ball through your team's goal ring while standing inside the goal circle. The other team's goalie will be protecting this net. The goal attack and goal shoot players are allowed to score goals.
 There are 2 umpires on the court, who make decisions during the game and call penalties.


Major rules prohibit contact (accidental or deliberate), obstructing play, and intimidating your opponents. Should someone break a major rule, the offending player has to stand out of play while the other team throws a pass or shot from where the offense occurred.Minor rules prohibit holding the ball for more than 3 seconds, stepping while in possession of the ball, moving out of the designated area for the position (offsides) or throwing the ball over a third of the court. Should an infringement on a minor rule occur, the other team gets a free pass from where the offense occurred.
 There is a 5 or 10-minute break at halftime and a 3-minute break after the first and third quarters.
 You win the game by scoring more goals than the other team before the game is over. Easier said than done!

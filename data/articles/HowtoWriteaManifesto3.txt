 Especially once you've gone over your work several times, it can sometimes be difficult to see what is on the page. You lose focus. You read sentences half-way or you read too fast and you miss mistakes. When you read your work out loud, you're more likely to catch some of these errors you missed. It can also help you catch awkward sentences, but also will give you a sense of how it feels.
 This means making changes to the big picture. By revising your work, you take your rough draft and turn it into something that is better developed and tailored to its purpose. Don't worry about all the little things in this phase. What you want to do is to make broad-stroke changes.

Cut out anything unnecessary.

Use stronger language.

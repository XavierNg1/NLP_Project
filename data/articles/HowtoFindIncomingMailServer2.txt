IMAP is recommended for use with Gmail because you can check your email by visiting gmail.com as well as within your mail client.
You can use POP, but understand that once your mail software “pops” the message from Gmail, you won’t be able to log into Gmail in your web browser to read or respond to the message.
 Log into Gmail (in your web browser) and open the Settings menu. Click the “Forwarding and POP/IMAP” link and select “Enable IMAP” or “Enable POP,” depending on your needs. Click “Save Changes” when done.
 The IMAP server is imap.gmail.com and the port is 993. The POP server is pop.gmail.com and the port is 995.


The username and password for your mail settings is the same as what you use to log into Gmail.
Gmail only offers secure POP and IMAP.

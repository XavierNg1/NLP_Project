 This will prevent senders from becoming confused or feeling frustrated as a result of thinking that the autoreply is your real response to their message. For example, place the phrase "Autoreply" in your subject heading, or explain in the autoreply that the response is automatic.;
, An explanation will inform your senders about the nature of your absence. For example, if you are unable to respond to email because you are on vacation, state in your autoreply that you are unable to respond for this reason.
 This will alert your senders as to when they can expect a real response from you, and can inform them of steps they must take to resolve time-sensitive needs. For example, inform them of the date you plan on responding to email, as well as contact information for a co-worker if necessary.

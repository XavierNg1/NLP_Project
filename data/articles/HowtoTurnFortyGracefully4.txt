 If you like eating desert, don’t deny yourself just because people expect you not to eat it. Being yourself will help you live a full life at forty and beyond.
 Are you engaged in work where you feel you’re useful, appreciated, and rewarded? Are you married to the person you really love? If you are, congratulations! If not, consider making a change. Ask yourself what you want from life. Many people go through what appears from the outside to be a midlife crisis when they reach forty, but is in fact simply a realization that they are aging and want to make the most of their lives., You could remain in an unhappy but stable situation, or you could be brave and take the leap into something new.


Many people choose to stick with what they know for fear of the unknown. However, you may (and likely will) regret this later.
Even if moving to a new job or a new city is challenging and uncomfortable, you should take comfort in the fact that by embracing change you are now better positioned for real happiness and the opportunity to live the life you want.
Don't be afraid to fail. Even if you do, it's no big deal. Nobody is perfect.
 Perhaps you’ve gotten married or added a child or two to your family. Whatever the case, spend time with the people who care about you and who you care about.


Keep important friends in your life, too. Friends can enrich our lives and give us valuable perspectives on our problems, whether they’re big or small.
Don’t forget to spend time with your pets. Dogs, cats, and fish are people too! Give them love and attention and they will do the same for you.

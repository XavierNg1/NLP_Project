 You may want to incorporate in a state that has a lower filing fee to help keep your costs down. Your incorporation fee is a one-time filing fee that you pay to your state’s secretary of state office. Prices range anywhere from $50 to $455. Because this fee is only assessed once, many people don’t consider it a significant factor when considering the longevity of their company.Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Oklahoma and Mississippi have the lowest incorporation fees at $50.
Connecticut has the highest formation fees at $455.
 Most states require you to annually submit a one-page filing report to the secretary of state's office. Failure to submit this report in a timely manner can result in both monetary penalties (which differ by state), as well as dissolution of the corporation.Ohio and Alabama are the only two states that currently don’t require corporations to file any type of annual report.Check your state’s respective secretary of state office website for more information regarding filing procedures, due dates, penalties, and notices of pending dissolution.
 Along with annual filings, some states require corporations to pay an annual filing fee. Annual filing fees range in price from $9 (New York) to $325 (Nevada) or more. Visit each state’s secretary of state’s office website to compare filing fees.Filing fees for some of the more popular incorporation states are: Delaware $225 for corporations; Wyoming $52; South Dakota $50; and California $21.

 If you're an independent contractor, this is all you'll need to receive remote payment online. This option is especially useful for freelance workers operating online. Many businesses that use freelance employees prefer this method of payment for its ease in one-time payments.


Your employer will also need a PayPal account for this method. Check with your employer if you're not sure whether they accept this form of paying.
If the person making a payment does not have a PayPal account you can still request money from them. After you log in to your My PayPal page, click Send and Request. On the next page click Request Money and enter the person's email address and the amount requested. On the next page add a note if desired. Then click Request and PayPal will send the request and notify you when the payment arrives.
 This is all you have to do when you want to be paid. An employer who uses this method of payment will provide their own payment information.
 From your "My Account" homepage, select "Withdraw." On the next page, you'll have several options for getting your money. You can:


Transfer money from your PayPal account to a bank account (for free).
Request a check be mailed to you (for $1.50.)
Request a PayPal debit card (for free).
Withdraw cash from an ATM (for $1.00).
Note: You should also receive an email at your PayPal-associated email address when you're paid. This email should contain instructions for retrieving your money.
 Depending on the method of payment you selected, you may be asked for your bank account number, address, or other contact information. If you transfer your money to a bank account, allow 3-4 days for processing. If you request a check or a debit card, allow 5-10 days for it to arrive.

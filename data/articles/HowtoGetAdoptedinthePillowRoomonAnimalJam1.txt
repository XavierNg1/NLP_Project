 If you cannot find anyone willing to adopt you, try a different server.;
, Choose a cute animal such as bunnies, foxes, possibly koalas, and other cute animals. Choosing those animals will give you the most possibilities!

, Avoid dressing in scary or displeasing fashions, because then people will not want to adopt you. Choose cute clothing such as head flowers, old hoods, old blankets, fox hats, and clover blankets.
 Consider the following questions: Is it a newborn? Is it a dog or cat? Is it a baby dragon? Choosing cute characters with good backstories help!


Example 1: I am a newborn puppy that was left on the street. Please adopt me!
Example 2: I am a baby dragon that needs a home! If you're kind and nice, please adopt me!!

, Now choose the nicest person!


Example 1: Can I plz adopt you? You are so cute! Choose this person!
Example 2: I will adopt you if you trade me your nm sword! Do not choose this person! After you have found the ideal person, buddy them.
 Don't misbehave too much! A little can be fun and add some drama!

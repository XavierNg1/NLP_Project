 Bruxish can be found on Route 13, Route 14, Route 15, and Secluded Shore. You have a 1% chance of catching it by fishing normally, and a 20% chance of catching it in a bubbling spot. You can find one from anywhere between level 10 and level 33.;
, Once in one of those places, use the Lapras Paddle to surf on the water.
 In bubbling areas, you'll be able to catch rarer Pokémon more often.
 When an exclamation mark appears above your character's head, press A again to reel in your rod. You'll either go into a Pokémon battle, or find an item, such as a Pearl. If it tells you that nothing seems to be biting, cast your rod again. If the bubbling spot disappears, go out of the area you're in and then back in again to make the bubbling spot appear again.
 Dive Balls are a good ball to catch it with, since they work best on Pokémon that live underwater.

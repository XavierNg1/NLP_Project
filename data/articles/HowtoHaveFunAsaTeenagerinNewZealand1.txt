 New Zealand has the best rugby team in the world (the All Blacks) and the best netball team, too (the Silver Ferns). New Zealanders also love cricket, soccer, basketball, and rugby. Gather a group of your friends together to play one of these sports. If you have a good time, you should make it a weekly event., Bungee jumping, biscuiting, sea fishing, whitebait fishing, whale watching, skiing, going to hot pools, and pig hunting are just some of the activities teens can enjoy in New Zealand. Gather a group of friends and do a new activity every weekend., Put on your favorite pair of outdoor shoes or boots and head out to one of the many amazing tramping locations across New Zealand. You can follow some of the more well known routes or you can go to somewhere only the locals know about. Try camping as well, and hone your skills in fire making, camp cooking and sleeping under the stars.


There are many amazing places to hike and camp in New Zealand, but here are some suggestions: the Abel Tasman National Coast Track, Tongariro National Park, Mount Cook National Park, and the Abbey Caves.Never tramp alone. Always go with at least one other person and preferably in a group. Always let people know when you leave, where you're going and when you expect to be back.
Hypothermia is a real issue when tramping. Don't get caught out overnight without adequate warmth. Even if you're going on a short day tramp, always have a thermal (polyprop), rain jacket and a warm jacket just in case.
Have plenty of water and trail mix to keep you well hydrated and energized.
 Perhaps you haven't been to Rotorua or Dunedin yet? Or maybe you'd like to take the train across the North Island or catch a train across the South Island? Plan for some expeditions that show you more of your country.


Plane fares are reasonable between major cities and towns. You might want to consider buses for the less major hubs though, as the flights will be a lot more expensive.

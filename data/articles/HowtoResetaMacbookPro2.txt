 Parameter Random Access Memory (PRAM) â€” it sounds really technical, but all you need to know is that PRAM is a small amount of memory that your computer uses to store system settings. If you're having problems booting up your computer, or are having odd display glitches, resetting your PRAM might solve your problem.
 Either turn it off through the Apple menu or press and hold the Power button for ten seconds.
,,, Resetting your PRAM may clear out some of your system settings, such as which display to use or system volume.

 After vacuuming your rug thoroughly, sprinkle some talcum powder on the surface and allow it to sit on the rug overnight. The powder will absorb unwanted odors left by pets or smoke. The next day, use your vacuum to lift the powder from your carpet.You can purchase talcum powder at many different department stores.
 Mix 1/4 cup (59.1 mL) white vinegar and 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) liquid dishwashing detergent with 2 cups (473.17 mL) of room temperature water in a bucket and use it to remove harder stains.The vinegar's acidity prevents the colors in your carpet from running and can eliminate unwanted odors.
 If your rug is expensive, made of material like silk, or has sentimental value, it may be a good idea to take it to a professional rug cleaner rather than trying to do it yourself. Carpet cleaners have years of experience working with different types of rugs and will know the best course of action for your problem. While it will cost money, it may be worth it so you can avoid repairs in the future.

 Your child should first see the dentist either when their first tooth appears or by the time they turn one.This visit is meant mostly to talk with parents and help your child get accustomed to the dentist’s chair., Ask your the dentist about when the next appointment should be. Generally, if your child has transitioned from sucking on a bottle to using a cup and does not eat at night, you can wait another full year before returning.


Help your child transition from a bottle to a sippy cup. Sucking on a bottle for a long period of time can be harmful to your child’s teeth. The sugars in the liquid can diminish the enamel in your child’s mouth causing a condition called bottle mouth.Discourage the use of a bottle for long periods of time.
 By the age of two, you should start taking your child to the dentist every six months. Frequent visits to the dentist at an early age helps children get accustomed to the procedure and helps combat any oral problems that may develop., Try to schedule an appointment earlier in the day when your child is more alert.This is especially true for younger children and toddlers who might be cranky in the late afternoon.
 Whenever your child has an appointment with a new doctor, be sure to bring their medical history. This will let the dentist know of any past conditions that may affect current care.Remember to tell the dentist about any thumbsucking habits, teething, and bottle use.

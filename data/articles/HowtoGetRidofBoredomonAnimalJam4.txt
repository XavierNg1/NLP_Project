 Don't just find nice people, find people with your interest. Of course, you don't want to be friends with a bully or a scammer, but also try to find people who like what you like so you can do things together. If you find out one of your buddies is a bully or a scammer, report and block them.
 Go around Jamma, shop a little, play a little, but mostly solve conflicts and make friends. This is really fun to do and is encouraged. If you see another person going on a hike,Â making new friends, and being kind, drop by and say hi. Be as kind as you can and gain ranks in kindness on Animal Jam.

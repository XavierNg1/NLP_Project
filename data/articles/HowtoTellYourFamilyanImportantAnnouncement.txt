 Pick a time when people can sit down and listen. Don't try to announce things when some of your relatives have one foot out of the door.;
, Call them to sit down in a living room or kitchen, anywhere that they can get comfortable in.
 Be gentle, particularly if it's a sad subject. Try speaking with a lead point; for example, if someone in your family has died, you could say something like "I know you all loved Aunt Shauna ..."

, If you've got kids in the room, don't make a difficult announcement about a very adult subject. You may need to break the sections of your family up so that you can address them appropriately. Make sure that younger children can understand what you're telling them (if they even need to know).
 Be serene and maintain a positive vibe. Even if it is a serious announcement, avoid being melodramatic or shocking.
 If it was a sad or serious announcement, give them time to process and let their emotions out. That will make them feel better. If it is manageable, then ease them up by cracking a joke. If it was a good announcement, smile so that your family does not get tense; celebrate with them as appropriate.
 Thank your family for taking the time to listen to you. If needed, follow-up later in the day or on future days to check what impact your announcement had.

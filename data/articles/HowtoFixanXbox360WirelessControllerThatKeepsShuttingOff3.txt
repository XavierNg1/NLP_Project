 While not a recommended fix by Microsoft, some people have had success "rebooting" their Xbox's controller set-up. Know, however, that you should contact Microsoft Support before trying this.


These tips come from several online communities and forums, not Microsoft directly.
 Make sure the Xbox is on. The lights on the front of the Xbox will blink and spin, but eventually turn off. Hold the button until the lights are off.
 Take out the power cord from the wall and the Xbox, remove the inputs, and detach the Xbox hard drive from the console.
 After you've waited, plug everything back in and try to connect your controller using the steps discussed in method 2.


If you still cannot connect controllers, you'll need to discuss the problem with Microsoft and potentially get a replacement Xbox 360.

 Make it the day of or few days after school gets out. If you need to, ask your parents if you can have the party before you invite anyone.


Invite your friends. You can make handmade cards with art supplies, use your computer to make the invitations, call your friends, ask your friends in person, or make a Facebook event.
Get the decorations. You can get decorations at many party stores or you can make them yourself. Make a banner that says “Welcome to Summer!” You could get decorations that are graduation themed or summer themed.
 Your party could include throwing water balloons, going swimming, sleepovers, planning parties, baking, playing sports, watching movies, singing karaoke, or playing board games.


Have a photo booth. Set up a back drop and get out a camera to create a photo booth. You could even buy or make props and signs for the pictures, such as scarves, glasses, graduation hats, and beach balls.
Make it a sleepover. Sleep inside or outside in tents if it is warm enough. Make s’mores either over a fire outside or in your microwave. , Make sure to feed your guests with a meal, snacks, and dessert. Celebrate the start of summer with summer themed foods – hamburgers, hotdogs, milk shakes, fruits, ice cream, chips, and lemonade. You could cook or barbeque the food yourself or you could have your party catered.

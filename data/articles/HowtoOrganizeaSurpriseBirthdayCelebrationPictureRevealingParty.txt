 Ask your honoree and party organizers to reserve the date. The ideal timing might be a week or two after the birthday celebration.;
, Distribute the invitations as guests are leaving the birthday celebration.


Send an email reminder about the Picture Revealing Party, too.
 Include photos taken at the birthday celebration (as well as the planning party, see link below). Be sure to include great quotes from the party.
 You can do this on a television, a wall or a screen; test the setup to be sure that it works.
,


Blindfold your honoree.
Display each page of the album for everyone to see (except the blindfolded honoree).
As each photo is displayed have all of the guests make humorous comments about it.
Ask your honoree to describe what s/he thinks the picture is showing.
Take lots of notes.
Remove honoree's blindfold.
Note: this game might be most fun if the honoree was blindfolded for part of their birthday celebration, such as the activity holding signs (see reference on Birthday Suggestions website below) so they genuinely don't know what is on some of the album pages.

Take some photos as the honoree and guests view pages of the album for the first time.
If you played the Previewing the Album game, read back the honorees description of each photo just before you show the page that relates to the description. See how closely the description matches the photo.
, Include these along with photos taken at the revealing in an appendix to the album.
 If you decide to post the album, be sure that the guest of honor and others included in the pictures agree to the online posting and privacy settings for the album.

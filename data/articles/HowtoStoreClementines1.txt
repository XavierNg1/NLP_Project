 A basket or wire mesh container works best, but any container with an open top will be suitable. Wooden crates with open slits along the side work great, as well.


Do not place the fruit in a sealed container. Cutting off air circulation could hasten the spoiling process, causing the clementines to become moldy or rotten quicker. Storing the fruit in a container that lets more air flow through will minimize this effect.;
, Cooler temperatures and low humidity are also preferred conditions.


Sunlight, warmth, and humidity are all factors that help clementines ripen. With ripe clementines, however, these conditions cause the fruit to over-ripen faster.
 When stored at room temperature, most clementines will last up to two or three days.If the fruit was in excellent condition starting out and the conditions of the room are ideal, you may even be able to store the clementines in this manner for a full week.

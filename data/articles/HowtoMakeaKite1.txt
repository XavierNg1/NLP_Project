 If you must, tape four pieces of paper together. But you have to tape them together the right way! Tape the two on top together, then tape together the two on bottom. Tape them on each other, making sure they're secure.

, Take a look at the design below for a good idea on proportions. The diamond needs to be slightly bottom heavy -- about 3" from the top is where your two left and right corners should lie.
 To make sure they're in the right spot, line them up with your paper first. Tie as tight as possible! It should be securely knotted and the excess string cut off.









Any string that will keep it in place will do the job. As long as it doesn't come undone and isn't rope (rope is bulky).
Wooden BBQ Skewers work well for sticks. Just don't stab yourself! Ow.
 Thread a string through each hole and around each pipe cleaner or stick. Leave a bit extra on the top to thread a ribbon on, if desired later. Knot the stick in place to the kite itself.
 Then tie the string to the center of that string for your flying line. This string needs to be as long as you need to be for flying!








, You can add small strips of material to the end of the kite for added buoyancy and weighting. It also looks more complete.
 Ask someone to help you hold your kite as you wait for a moderate wind to come. The wind should be blowing toward you, not from behind.


When you sense a breeze coming, start running and throw it up into the air! With luck, it'll stay airborne.
 It's so much more gratifying when you make it all yourself, isn't it? Once you get bored with simple flight, start doing twists, turns, and dives.


And if your kite isn't perfect...you may want to be prepared for repairs and bring tape with you.

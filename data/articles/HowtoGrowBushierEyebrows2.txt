 Your sparse-looking brows may actually be full of little white baby hairs, and tinting them a darker shade will reveal a bolder, thicker eyebrow.Tinting lasts between three and five weeks.Tinting can easily go wrong if the shade is too dark, the chemicals too harsh, or you stain your skin, so make sure you go to a professional with a good reputation., Visit a brow bar or salon for this procedure, where they will glue individual synthetic or natural hairs to your brow hair, creating the (temporary) full brow of your dreams. Unlike eyelash extensions, brow extensions will not damage your existing hair as they fall off, so they won't interrupt your progress if you're growing yours out.If you don't have eyebrows, the extensions can be glued directly to your skin, but they will only last a few days.Extensions only last a few weeks at the most, and touching, washing, or exercising can make them fall off even faster., If your eyebrow hair will no longer grow, a plastic surgeon can carefully design a brow that best fits your face and build it using your own hair. The finished look should be natural, with the new hair blending into your brow.A brow transplant is irreversible, so make sure you are thinking about what looks best on you, not what is most popular right now.Do some research and find a reputable surgeon who has experience with the procedure. Ask to see before and after pictures from their other clients.

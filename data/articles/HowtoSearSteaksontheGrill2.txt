 A sear burner is a separate section of a gas grill that has an infrared plate to create extremely high temperatures. Sear your steaks on this burner and then move them to a cooler section of the grill to cook them through. You do not need to close the lid while the steaks are searing.
 Preheat another burner on your gas grill at a medium setting. Coat the burners with nonstick cooking spray.
 The quantity will depend on the size of your steaks and the size of your burner. Make sure that you have at least 2‚Äù (5 centimeters) of space between the pieces of meat so that they can cook evenly.
 Flip the steaks over using a pair of tongs and sear them for an additional 1-1/2 minutes on the other side. Each side of the steaks should have a crisp, caramelized crust that is brown without being burnt., Use a meat thermometer to ensure that your steaks are cooked to the right temperature depending on your preference for doneness.
 You can use your own hand to check how done your steaks are, making sure you get it off perfectly each and every time. Simply press one finger into the steak and compare the feeling to various parts of your hand. To check doneness with your hand:



Raw: Touch the fleshy part of your palm right underneath the thumb. It should have a lot of give.

Well done: Touch your thumb and pinky together on the same hand. Then touch the fleshy part under your thumb with the opposite hand. It will be firm.

Medium: Touch your thumb and ring finger together, then check the palm. It will be a little less firm.

Medium Rare: Touch the thumb and middle fingers, then check the palm.

Rare: Touch the thumb and pointer, then check the palm., Standing the meat refers to letting it sit, uncut, for 5-6 minutes. This allows the meat to reabsorb the juices and fats that liquefied in the high heat, and will lead to a juicier, better tasting steak every time.

 To calculate the growth rate, you're going to need the starting value. The starting value is the population, revenue, or whatever metric you're considering at the beginning of the year.

For example, if a village started the year with a population of 125, then the starting value is 125.
;
, To calculate the growth, you'll not only need the starting value, you'll also need the final value. That value is the population, revenue, or whatever metric you're considering at the end of the year.

For example, if a village ended the year with a population of 275, then the final value is 275.
 The growth is calculated with the following formula: Growth Percentage Over One Year = FinalValue−StartValueStartValue∗100{\displaystyle {\frac {FinalValue-StartValue}{StartValue}}*100}Example Problem. A village grows from 150 people at the start of the year to 275 people at the end of the year. Calculate its growth percentage this year as follows:

Growth Percentage =275−150150∗100{\displaystyle ={\frac {275-150}{150}}*100}


=125150∗100{\displaystyle ={\frac {125}{150}}*100}

≈ 0.8333∗100{\displaystyle 0.8333*100}

= 83.33%{\displaystyle 83.33\%}

 Finding an area at your party will allow you to assess how big to make the arch and how many beach balls will be needed.;
, You could create the arch as more of a backdrop for photo ops, which means you won’t need to take into consideration party guests’ height, etc.


Take measurements of the area where you plan to place the arch. Consider both height and width to help you determine the number of beach balls and inner tubes required for building.
 Although this arch should be self standing, you may want to find an area where you can affix the arch to a support, especially if you are planning an outdoor party (where wind could blow the arch over, etc.).

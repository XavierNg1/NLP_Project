 Make sure your bird table is high enough to prevent easy access by your cat. The bird table should be at least six feet tall. Also, having your table on single pole makes it difficult for your cat to climb up.Additionally, spread Vaseline on the poles of your bird tables to make it extra difficult for your cat to climb., Keep your bird tables away from surfaces that your cat can jump from, like fences and trees. Also, do not place the table near shrubbery that cats can hide in and attack from.If you are using a hanging bird feeder, place it on a branch that your cat cannot access, or place it on a small, weak branch that will break under a catâ€™s weight.
 Place spiny or prickly plants around the bottom of your bird table or feeder. These plants will make it uncomfortable and hard for your cat to get to the bird table. You can also place these plants with your bushes to make it difficult for your cat to hide in and launch a surprise attack from.

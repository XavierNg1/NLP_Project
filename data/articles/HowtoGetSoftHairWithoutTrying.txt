 Brush your hair before your shower, and comb it afterwards, this will help you evenly spread shampoos and conditioners.

, Make sure that the temperature of the water is not hot. Hot water can damage your hair. When you shampoo, use warm water. When you condition, use cold water. Cold water makes your hair shiny.









Don't wash your hair every day, that can dry your scalp. If you want to shower, buy a shower cap, even a really cheap one will work. Baths are good too, as the steam moisturizes your hair and it is very relaxing.
 Baths are good for this, but don't wash out shampoo with bathwater, use a shower head, but you can stay in the bath for this, as long as you have a shower above or close enough to the bathtub.
 You wouldn't want to hurt yourself, now would you? Gently now.
 Make sure to get rid of any excess shampoo (this will leave your hair dry if you fail to wash out any remaining shampoo or conditioner!) Once again, if in a bath, use a shower head!








, There is no need to condition the scalp of your hair.
 If having a shower, turn off the water, and if in a bath, make sure the ends of you hair do not touch the water. Also, this will save money, waste not want not.
 If you need to, check in a mirror to see if there are any bits you might have missed.
 Cold water is good for your hair as it seals the cuticle, leaving your hair nice and shiny! Slowly re-enter the shower as the cold can be a shock.
 Use a wide tooth comb as brushing may lead to breaking of the hair. Moisture stretches out your hair, and makes it more vulnerable.
 It is much healthier if you let it air dry. Make sure not to rustle your hair with a towel in an effort to get it to dry quicker. Instead, gently pat your hair dry.

, It’s important to follow up with people you meet, whether they are potential new friends or professional contacts. If you click with a new person, a call, email, or text is a great way to follow up.Send a short email to the person you met at a professional networking event. For example, you could write, “Thank you for taking the time to talk with me about your work. I’d love to hear more about it next time you’re in New York for business.”
Send brief message on social media to a new friend. Try writing, “It was great to meet at the baseball game. Hopefully I’ll see you at the next one.”

, After you follow up and receive a response from your new connection, schedule some time to spend together. This could be as simple as having coffee with a new work colleague, or asking your soccer teammate if she’d like to carpool to next week’s game. Put it on your calendar and prioritize strengthening the relationship by spending time together., It’s important to keep up with connections even when you’re not spending time together.

 For the best results, train your dachshund during three five minute sessions every day. Keeping training sessions short will help your dachshund to remain attentive. The frequency will help reinforce what you want your dachshund to learn., In order to get your dachshund to do what you want him to do, you need to reward his good behavior as soon as he does it. For example, if you ask you dachshund to sit and he complies, immediately offer him some praise and petting to let him know that he did something good. You should reward your dachshund whenever he does good things so that he knows that these are the behaviors you like., You help your dachshund to understand what you do not want him to do by simply ignoring the bad behavior or withholding the reward. For example, if your dachshund wants to go for a walk and he is sprinting around the house because he is so excited, ignore him and wait until he stops to put on his harness. When he stops and stands still, put on his harness and take him for a walk. Do this every time you walk your dachshund to help him understand what you do not want him to do. He will learn that running around does not lead to a walk, but standing still does., If you have trouble getting your dachshund to follow your commands, consider hiring someone to help you train your dog. A certified professional dog trainer can help you to train your dachshund. This may be especially helpful if you are struggling to correct bad behaviors.You can also look for group training classes in your area if youâ€™d like to provide some socialization for your dachshund as well.

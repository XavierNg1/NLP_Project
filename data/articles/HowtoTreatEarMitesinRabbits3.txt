 Whenever your bunny shows any signs of ear problems, you should take him to the vet immediately. Ear problems can cause major pain for your rabbit, and point to severe infections.You should tell your vet about all the symptoms you have seen in your bunny. Make sure to be as detailed as possible and tell your vet about anything you think is odd about your rabbitâ€™s behavior.
 Your vet will perform an ear exam to check for any abnormalities. The best way for your vet to diagnose ear mites is by rolling a cotton swab in a sample of the ear wax.Then, your vet will smear the swab on a microscope slide and examine it under the microscope.
 If the infestation is bad enough, the vet may not have to do an ear swab. In heavy infestations, it is possible to see the glistening bodies of the ear mites when viewed with an otoscope.An otoscope is an instrument designed for looking in ears which has a light source and magnification.

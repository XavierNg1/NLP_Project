 A two-seam fastball is gripped with the index and middle fingers on the two narrow seams of the baseball.;
, Make sure your fingers are relatively close together. Your fingers can either be positioned so that your middle finger runs along the seam, or so that the seam runs directly in the middle of both fingers. Experiment with what works best for you.
 Diametrically opposed just means that if you extended both fingers in the same direction, they would eventually form a perfect circle.


Think of the ball like a clock. If your thumb on a normal two-seam grip is at 6 o'clock, your thumb now should be at a 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock position.
 For right-handed pitchers, this means turning your wrist slightly to the left. For left-handed pitchers, this means turning your wrist slightly to the right.
 When throwing a two-seam fastball, put extra pressure on your middle finger. This will create a natural spin on the ball that will help it cut.

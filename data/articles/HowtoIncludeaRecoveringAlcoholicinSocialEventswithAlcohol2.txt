 It will be much harder for a recovering alcoholic to avoid temptation if that’s all there is at the event to drink. Make sure that there are several non-alcoholic beverages available for them to choose from.This simple act can eliminate a lot of stress for you and the person.


Try to offer a variety of non-alcoholic drinks if you are the person hosting the event. For instance, you might have juices, soda, and water on hand.
For example, if everyone is drinking flutes of wine to toast the new couple, you might offer the person a flute of sparkling grape juice or ginger ale.
If necessary, consider bringing non-alcoholic beverages with you.
 Unless the event is a wine-tasting or something similar, there should be many other things to do besides drink. Focusing on those things rather than the alcohol at the event will make it much easier to include a recovering alcoholic. It will also keep the focus on the reason why you are there – to experience the event and create memories you and the person can share.


For example, rather than playing drinking games at a party, you might stick to games that don’t require drinking alcohol.
Or, for instance, if you are at an art showing, focus on the works that are being displayed rather than getting the drink waiter’s attention for another glass of wine.
 Although the person is a recovering alcoholic and some considerations need to be made, a public service announcement doesn’t need to be made about their sobriety at the event. Do what you can to maintain the person’s privacy and respect to make sure that they feels comfortable at the event.For instance, there’s no need to announce to everyone that the person is a recovering alcoholic. Just introduce them as you would anyone else.
Try to avoid asking them things like “Is that alcohol in that cup?” or making statements about their sobriety around strangers.

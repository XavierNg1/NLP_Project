 When using Facebook on a computer, you’ll see notifications in the Ticker (the activity feed on the right side of the screen) that a friend has commented on a post. Use this method to find your friend’s response on a thread with many comments, even when it’s buried within a thread.;
, It’s the text in the Ticker that says “(your friend) commented on (another person)’s post.”

, The post will appear with all comments expanded so that your friend’s response is visible. If there are a lot of comments, you'll have to scroll down to find your friend’s comment.You may just see a link that says “(friend’s name) replied” rather than the actual comment. Click that link to view the comment.
If there are still too many comments to wade through, press Ctrl+F (Windows) or ⌘ Cmd+F (macOS) to open a search box, then type your friend’s name. Use the navigational arrows next to the search box to scroll through the search results to find your friend’s comment.

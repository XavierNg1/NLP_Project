 Infants with cradle cap often have other symptoms related to dry, easily-irritated skin. Use a humidifier in your baby's room to keep the air moist and humid so his or her skin doesn't get too dry., Applying a moisturizer while the scalp is still slightly damp and warm after bathing can help trap moisture in the skin, preventing it from becoming dry and scaly. Use a lotion or ointment formulated for babies' sensitive skin.
 Cradle cap is in some cases caused by an allergy to baby formula. If your baby has red patches on his or her face and experiences diarrhea and other allergy symptoms in addition to cradle cap, talk to your doctor about switching to a formula that is healthier for your baby.

 Before you start, take a breath, relax, and prepare to take your time with this project. Expect it to be a relatively easy task, but at the same time, avoid the temptation to rush through it. The more you rush, the more likely you’ll slip along the way and accidentally nick, scratch, or make a deeper cut in the surrounding surfaces., Select an area along the caulk line to start. Hold your putty knife parallel to the caulk line and place the blade flat against either surrounding surface. Favor whichever one is smoothest to start. Edge the corner of the blade into and under the softened caulk, then push the blade along the caulk line to separate it from the surface.Ideally, you will be able to pull this loosened strip free of the other surface. If the bond is too strong to do so, repeat this process along the second surface.
 As you push the putty knife along, the caulk should come away in strips. As it does, smaller pieces may break off and lodge in the gap between the two surfaces, so go back over your work as you remove each strip. Pull those smaller bits out with a pair of needle-nose pliers.If the gap is very small, use tweezers instead.
 Even if most of the caulk came away in nice, long strips, go back and use your putty knife to remove any lingering lines that stuck to the surfaces along the caulk line’s edges. For extremely tough pieces, switch to a steel brush, toothbrush, or the hook feature in a 5-in-1 painter’s tool. Brush or chip away at any pieces that have hardened into place.Remember to do the same with any bits that are deep within the gap.
If needed, use your heat gun again to soften any stubborn bits.

 If your house is easy to access from the street, it’s a likely target for rioters. A chain link or wood plank fence is a visual and physical deterrent. Having to climb a fence may be enough reason for potential looters to pass by your house.Building a fence all around your house is no small project. If you don’t have the time or knowledge, you may be better off hiring a contractor to build it.
Taller fences give you even more protection. A ten foot (3 m) fence is harder to climb than a five foot (1.5 m) fence.;
, If you already have a fence, or if you build one, putting wire around the top adds a second layer of defense. It looks scary and will make people not want to climb over. It also makes it harder to get across if rioters do climb the fence.It may be safer to hire someone to attach the razor wire or barbed wire, as it is very sharp. If you do it yourself, make sure you know what you’re doing and use caution.
 If you have a chain link fence, rioters could cut through it with bolt cutters. Putting sheets of wood up against the fence adds privacy and another layer of defense.Attach each piece of plywood to the fence at the corners of the board with a u-bolt and nuts. Drill holes for the bolts, and then screw the nuts on from inside the fence.
 One of the biggest things that makes your house a target is darkness. If you don’t have street lights or other security lights already, you need to add some. Lights around your house may be enough to scare people off.Motion-activated lights save energy because they aren’t always on, and you have the added benefit of startling trespassers.
 In the early stages of a riot, an alarm system that alerts the authorities of a break-in to your house is helpful. Research alarm systems to see what you could afford to have installed. Once you have it, put a sign out that says your property is monitored, which might keep people away.

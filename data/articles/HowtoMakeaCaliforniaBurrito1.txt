 First, combine these spices in a large, sealable bowl: six minced garlic cloves, 1/2 cup chopped cilantro leaves, the juice of three limes and one lemon, one teaspoon of cumin, and a dash of salt and pepper. Mix well. Place the flank steak into the bowl and coat with the mixture. Cover and place into the refrigerator. Allow the steak to marinate for at least one hour â€“ but do not marinate overnight.;
, Lightly grease the grill grates of an outdoor grill. Heat the grill to medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade and season it on both sides (lightly) with salt and pepper. Cook the steak on the grill, flipping once, until the steak has reached your desired doneness. Once the steak has finished cooking, remove it from the grill and allow it to rest for 5 minutes. Slice the steak across the grain into thin slices.
 You'll need 3 ripe avocados (peeled and pitted); the juice of one lime; one teaspoon of salt; half a cup of diced onion; 3 tablespoons of fresh chopped cilantro; 1 teaspoon of fresh, minced garlic; and one pinch of cayenne pepper. First, mash the avocados in a medium bowl. Squeeze the lime juice and season with salt. Mix in onion, cilantro, garlic, and cayenne pepper. When the guacamole is ready, cover it and refrigerate it until you are ready to dole it into the burrito.


If you don't want to make the guacamole fresh from scratch, you can use pre-made or store-bought guacamole. Feel free to simply slice avocado directly into the burrito. Avocado (in whatever form) is a crux of the California burrito.
 You can buy frozen, pre-shaped fries, or you can cut your own fries from raw potatoes. Space the french fries out in a single layer atop a large baking sheet. Bake or deep-fry the french fries according to your personal preference and the package directions.

 When citing a book, start with the author's last name, followed by a comma and the author’s first name.


For example: “Jones, Bob.”
Use a period after the first name.;
, Place the title of the book in italics, so it is easy to identify.


For example: "Jones, Bob. Leaves and Trees."

For example: “Jones, Bob. Leaves and Trees. Odessa, Texas:”
Use title case capitalization for the title, meaning you capitalize the first and last word, and any other important words.
 Insert the publisher’s name after the colon, followed by a comma and the year of publication.


For example: “Jones, Bob. Leaves and Trees. Odessa, Texas: Cowboy Books, 1999.”
Place a period after the date.
 Use a capital letter and a period after the word.


For example: “Jones, Bob. Leaves and Trees. Odessa, Texas: Cowboy Books, 1999. Print.”

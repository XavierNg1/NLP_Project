 Before you do though:


Make sure you have met the breeder and know they are right for you.
Make sure you have seen and reserved the right cat for you, and seen its parent(s).
Make sure you have agreed a price with the breeder (pedigree cats can cost up to £500-£550, any more than this is probably a little overpriced, unless it's a very rare and special breed).
 Make sure all necessary paperwork is taken care of, and take your new companion into your car, in its little carrier.
 This is usually because they are moving, but their body is stationary. This is unsettling for them, so keep checking on your cat to make sure it is managing okay. If you managed to take a blanket/toy belonging to your kitty, put it in your cat's carrier so it will be a bit more relaxed. If you can, (though don't risk anything!), gently stroke your cat to calm it and reassure it that everything is okay before the car drive.
 Just a room, doesn't have to be grand or anything, where they can have some alone time and get settled in. Take the cat into the best room for this purpose, and make sure there's:


Food and water for cats
A scratching post

Some cat toys

A bed with some comfy blankets

 Air-drying can prevent static cling altogether. If you have to use a dryer, take your clothes out of it as soon as they are sufficiently dry or while they are still slightly damp. Over-drying your clothes can lead to static cling.


Static electricity is a product of friction between two electrically insulating materials. The ideal environment for static electricity to emerge is one in which conditions are dry with little humidity. In other words, the dryer is the ideal place for static energy to emerge., Some materials are morel likely to build up static electricity than others.Synthetic materials like polyester, nylon, rayon, and acetate tend to develop high levels of static cling after washing. Natural fabrics like cotton, wool, linen, and silk, on the other hand, tend to stay relatively static-free. Washing and drying natural and synthetic fibers in the same cycles can result in static cling on all your clothes, so it’s a good idea to wash them separately.


Alternately, you could choose to dry the natural materials in the machine and dry the synthetic materials on the line., While letting your clothes dry on the rack or on the line, run a humidifier. A humid atmosphere makes the air more conductive than the clothes for the buildup of static charges, which essentially makes the clothes a less attractive target. Running a humidifier during especially dry seasons like winter will also prevent buildup of static electricity on your clothes and body.


A drying rack is a small rack of wood or plastic with several parallel rungs upon which clothing can be set to dry.
 Instead of letting them run the full hour-long cycle, let them run only 45 minutes. Remove them and hang them on hangers or a washing line to dry the rest of the way. You’ll save money by running the machine for a shorter period and reduce your carbon footprint in addition to limiting the static cling of your clothes.

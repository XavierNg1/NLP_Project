 Knowing what kinds of things that your prom date likes doing will let you cater your proposal to their tastes and interests. Write down a list of what they like to do, including what their hobbies are, any sports or activities they are involved in, and the kind of music that they like. Try to incorporate one or more of these things into your proposal for homecoming or prom.


For instance, if the person you're asking out is really into tennis, you can spell out your proposal using tennis balls., Think of the person's personality and what touches them or gets them invested emotionally. This could be a specific song, photo imagery, or something that they have experienced in the past. Try to weave that into your proposal so that it has the most emotional impact.


For instance, if you know they have a favorite romantic song, you can create a dance and singing routine covering the song.
If you've taken pictures with your date, you can include them in a scavenger hunt for your proposal.
If you both like a quote or a line from a book, try to integrate that into your proposal.
 Some people don't like grand public gestures and are easily embarrassed. If your date has this kind of personality, doing something public and romantic might turn them off. In this case, you should ask them in a private setting. If your date enjoys showing off their affection, a grand or public proposal might be the better route.

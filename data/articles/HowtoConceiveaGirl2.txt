 Some research suggests that diet can influence whether you have a girl or a boy, although the research is doubted by some.Specifically, researchers say that a diet of magnesium and calcium may be helpful in conceiving a girl.
 Diets rich in calcium and magnesium may increase the alkalinity of the mother, which may not be as hospitable for male sperm.


Foods rich in calcium and magnesium include:

Nuts, such as almonds and cashews
Beans
Vegetables such as spinach and broccoli
Yogurt and tofu
Oatmeal



, The following foods should be put on the no-no list if you're adhering to the calcium and magnesium diet:


Anchovies, smoked salmon, and shrimp
Bacon, salami, and processed meats
Breads and pastries
Olives
Potatoes

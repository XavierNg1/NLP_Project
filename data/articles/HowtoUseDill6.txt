Hold a bowl under each dry dill flower with one hand and using scissors, snip off the dried flower and let it fall into the bowl. Expect some seeds to fall off the flower clusters as you cut them.
Remove the rest of the seeds from the dried flower clusters by shaking them gently or pulling them off with your fingers. Discard any stem pieces.
Spread the seeds on a cookie sheet in a single layer and bake them at 200°F(93°C) for 30 minutes.
Let the seeds cool and package them in clean plastic or glass jars with tight lids.
Store the jars in a cool, dark place.


Use a food processor or food chopper if you have one.
If you don’t have a food processor, place the seeds in a plastic bag, lay the bag on a firm surface and crush with a them with a hammer.
,, Use opened dill seeds or your own saved dried seeds within one year.

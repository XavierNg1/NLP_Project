 Put your leather item that needs de-wrinkling on a hanger. Make sure to use a hanger appropriate for the garment. If, for example, you need to get wrinkles out of a jacket, make sure you have a hanger with wide shoulders to ensure that the stress caused by pulling the jacket wonâ€™t result in additional creases along the shoulder line.For skirts and pants, use a hanger with rubber-padded clips and hang at the waistband to let the garment hang at its full length.
For items too large to hang, the pulling technique may not work.
Try to avoid thin metal hangers as these may bend when put under stress.;
, You will be pulling on the garment, so you need to hang it somewhere that can not only handle the force of the leather, but also withstand you pulling down on it. A beam in your closet, a coat rack, or other object meant for hanging clothes would be an ideal area.


Avoid areas like small nails on the wall or pressure rods for curtains, as these are susceptible to failing when put under stress.
 Using your hands, pull lightly on the garment until the wrinkles relax. Pull in opposite directions at the same time, meaning that if you are working on a vertical wrinkle, you should grab it from both the top and the bottom of the wrinkle and pull gently in both directions.


Relax your wrinkles by alternating pulling from the top and bottom and from both sides.
Do not hold a pull for too long. The exact amount of stress a leather piece can take depends on the garment, but avoid pulling for longer than three to five seconds at a time to be safe. Let the leather rest for another three to five seconds before you begin pulling again.
Understand that this method is intended for small wrinkles, not for larger wrinkles or creases.

 Be sure to use a garment bag that can be sealed so that it is as close to airtight as possible.


Never use a garment bag when storing your coat for long periods of time. It prevents the skin from breathing.If the skin of a fur coat is not allowed to breath, it can develop mold or mildew.
Remember, furs should always be hung on broad, padded hangers to prevent the shoulders from losing their form., Do not seal the container.
 Be careful when setting the container at the bottom of the garment bag. Since it really isn't designed to be holding anything but a flat article of clothing, chances are there will be spillage. Simply do your best to minimize the mess.


You can put the coffee in a brown paper lunch bag and fold it up, but it will take quite a bit longer for any odor to be absorbed.
 Depending on the type of odor that you are trying to eliminate--smoke, mildew, etc.,--it may be gone in as little as 24-hours., If the odor hasn't been removed in 24-hours, simply stir the coffee grounds and allow the coat to continue to sit in the garment bag for another day.Be sure to check daily.
 Once the odor has been eliminated from your coat, be sure to remove it from the garment bag so that it can breath and be stored properly.

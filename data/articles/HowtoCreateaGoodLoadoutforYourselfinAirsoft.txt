 Go to websites choose and see videos from YouTube regarding loadouts and finally choose you're style. An impression loadout is a copy of a real combat regiment or a real loadout of an army.;
, An impression loadout will easily fit around in a hundred dollars. But competitive may be expensive. Impressions are less practical during airsoft matches.
 Buy beginner level guns like spring rifles if you're a beginner, or you can even start with standard electric rifles. M4 can be a good start. (If you're using an impression loadout, search the gun you're desired regiment for impression uses; eg. Marines-M16). Choose a gun whose price fits as in 1/3 of you're total budget; your gear and stealth are equally important.
 A semi-automatic pistol as a sidearm will be a good start for beginners. Now choose your helmet and camo for vests, helmet and BDU (battle dress uniform) or clothing. Camo will be the pattern of you're whole loadout; if you're playing in an urban field choose a UCP (universal camouflage pattern) pattern or if playing in desert type area choose the desert camo/UCP. If you're using an assault rifle, CO2 will be a good sidearm.
 This is the place on which you're vest and other tactical gear will be placed. It should be of the same camo you chose for the helmet; a sweatshirt of the same camo is preferable as your inner clothing.
 You can buy a cheap, plate vest with pouches as a starter or a tactical vest to be more stealthy, protective and tactical. Choose the vest color, choose the color of the vest carefully; if your camo is a desert camo use tan colored vests or black vests for darker camos. You can also use the same scheme, eg. you can use "UCP" colored vest for you're UCP in camouflaging which is an important procedure to defend, and conclude tactical attacks on the other team.
, Now put your safety materials onto your loadout like guards, safety goggles etc.
 Your basic loadout is done!

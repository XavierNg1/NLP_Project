 A sphere is a perfectly round three-dimensional object, in which every point on the surface is an equal distance from the center. In other words, a sphere is a ball-shaped object., The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = 4/3πr3 (stated: "four-thirds times pi r-cubed") where r is the radius of the sphere, and π is the constant pi (3.14)., If the radius is given in the diagram, then finding r is simply a matter of locating it. If the diameter is given, you must divide this number by 2 to find the radius. For example, the radius of the sphere in the diagram is 3 inches.
 If you need to measure a spherical object (like a tennis ball) to find the radius, first find a piece of string large enough to wrap around the object. Then wrap the string around the object at its widest point and mark the points where the string overlaps itself. Then measure the string with a ruler to find the circumference. Divide that value by 2π, or 6.28, and that will give you the radius of the sphere.

For example, if you measure a ball and find its circumference is 18 inches, divide that number by 6.28 and you will find that the radius is 2.87in.
Measuring a spherical object can be a little tricky, so you might want to take 3 different measurements, and then average them together (add the three measurements together, then divide by 3) to make sure you have the most accurate value possible.
For example, if your three circumference measurements were 18 inches, 17.75 inches, and 18.2 inches, you would add those three values together (18 + 17.5 + 18.2 = 53.95) and divide that value by 3 (53.95/3 = 17.98). Use this average value in your volume calculations.
 Cubing a number simply means multiplying the number by itself 3 times, so r3 = r * r * r. In our example, r = 3, so r3 = 3 * 3 * 3, or 27.
 You can either use your calculator, or do the multiplication by hand and then simplify the fraction. In our example, multiplying 27 by 4/3 = 108/3, or 36.
 The last step in calculating the volume is simply to multiply the result so far by π. Rounding π to two digits is usually sufficient for most math problems (unless your teacher specified otherwise,) so multiply by 3.14 and you have your answer.


In our example, 36 * 3.14 = 113.09.
 In our example, the measurement of the radius of the sphere was in inches, so our answer is actually V = 113.09 cubic inches (113.09 in3).

 Season with two tablespoons of sea salt.


Allot at least 1 liter (0.3 US gal) for each crab that you are cooking. 2 crabs would mean at least 2 liters (0.5 US gal) of water, while 5 crabs would mean at least 5 liters (1.3 US gal) of water.;
, If you want to stun the crab before dropping it in (thus killing it more humanely), take it by its legs and gently wave its head through the top of the water for several seconds.
, The crab's shell will turn a bright orange color when the crab is fully cooked.


A large crab (~2 lbs) will take between 15 and 20 minutes to cook.
A smaller crab (~1 lb or below) will take between 8 and 10 minutes to cook.
,


Twist off the claws and legs of the crab. Use a crab mallet or a nutcracker to break the crab shell at the joints and then in the widest part of the shell.
Place the crab upside down. Then pull up the tail flap (also called an "apron") and throw away.
Turn the crab over and discard the upper shell. Then place the crab on its back again and wipe away the gills, innards, and jaw.
Crack the crab in half and enjoy the meat inside the body.

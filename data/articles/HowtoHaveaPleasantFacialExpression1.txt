 Resting facial expressions aren’t always a direct correlation of how you’re feeling. Many people simply have a serious disposition. This creates an uninviting demeanor. Take a picture of your resting face and look at the expression.


Would you be comfortable starting small-talk with someone who shared your expression?
If you were on a bus and asked to introduce yourself to someone, would this expression be one to interact with?;
, Looking at a picture of your face will produce biased feelings. The best way to get a sense of your true resting facial expression is to ask others. If comfortable, ask strangers. Your family and friends have grown accustomed to your face and can typically sum it up with, “it’s just your face.” Asking strangers what kind of emotion you convey through your face will give you the most truthful reactions., The easiest way to do this is to learn to wiggle your ears. Look in the mirror and start practicing. You’ll likely notice that you raise your eyebrows, squint your eyes, and open and close your mouth a lot. These all use different facial muscles. Keep practicing until you can wiggle your ears because this shows awareness and control over your facial muscles.


Knowing how to make small adjustments to your face will help you control muscles to create a pleasant expression.
 Nervous habits can prevent you from showing a pleasant facial expression. Biting your nails, or having a nervous facial tick can be seen as unprofessional because you look uninterested and distracted.


If your facial tics, including nose wrinkling, eye blinking, squinting, grimacing, or mouth twitching, are a constant and uncontrollable issue, it is possible to reduce them overtime through hypnosis.

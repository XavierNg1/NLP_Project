 Most modern gangs have specific colors in which members dress. Make sure your clothing doesn't accidentally telegraph allegiance to a rival gang by being the wrong color.
 You need to be able to run, so skip the heels and sandals. Pick shoes that allow you to sprint easily and don't feel uncomfortable after several hours on your feet.
 Rotate a variety of styles through your daily look. Slim-fitting tank tops, plaid button-up shirts, baby tees and off-the-shoulder blouses are street appropriate. For jeans or skirts, find a fit that works for you and go with it.
 Use loud, big accessories to display your confidence. Common gangster girl accessories include bandanas, hoop earrings, sunglasses, cross necklaces, and big rings.
 However you style your hair, make it a reflection of your attitude. Be aware that a long ponytail makes it easy for someone to grab you and pull you down if you're running.
 Look people straight in the eye and keep you posture straight. Subtle cues like this communicate that you're fearless and in control.

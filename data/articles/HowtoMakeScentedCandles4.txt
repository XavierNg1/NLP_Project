 Heat the water in the base compartment of the pan. Wait for the wax to slowly melt.
 Add more if you wishâ€“-the more dye added, the deeper the color will appear.
 Add either a few drops of essential oil or wax perfume.
 Pour the melted wax into the molds. Leave to set slightly.
 Cut into 5cm/2 inch lengths. Push each wick into the center of the setting wax.
 The wax will shrink a bit as it sets; if you think it needs a bit more, feel free to add a little more melted wax as a top-up.

Float the candles on top.
Add a few flat-headed flowers in between the floating candles for a prettier look.
Light the candles when needed.
Place the display in the middle of a table or somewhere else where a glowing decorative element is needed.

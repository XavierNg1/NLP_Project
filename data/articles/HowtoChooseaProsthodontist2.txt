 Every dentist should have the basic dental degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) or Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD). Prosthodontists should have completed three years of additional specialty training after finishing dentistry school and earning the basic degree. Ask where they went to school, and whether it was an accredited program., Not all states require prosthodontists to be certified, so ask to see the certification of the professional you choose.Prosthodontists have to recertify and take a test every 8 years to stay current on medical knowledge, so make sure their certification is up to date., Meet your chosen professional before your appointment. Chat with them and make sure you feel comfortable and that they listen to your needs.

Try to discern whether they seem up to date on the latest technology, procedures, and medications.Itâ€™s okay to write down things they say and then ask your family dentist about them later.

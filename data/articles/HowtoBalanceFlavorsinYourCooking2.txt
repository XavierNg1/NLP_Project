 In addition to seasoning individual ingredients, make sure you use complimentary flavor profiles between dishes. Your side dishes and main courses should have a more or less even flavor profile.For example, spicy, savory curry goes well with mild soup or rice.
If you're serving dishes in courses, a sweeter salad pairs well with a sour entree.
 Salt is vital to the cooking process. You should not be able to taste salt in a dish. In fact, if a dish tastes salty this is a sign you've added too much salt. A dish, however, should be lightly sprinkled with salt to bring out other flavors. After adding your flavor profile, sprinkle a little bit of salt at a time until the flavors are strong enough., When you're seasoning food, you will be unable to taste your flavors if you do not cleanse your palette. The more you sample food, the less you can taste it. Between taking bites to gauge taste, sip on water or something else with a neutral flavor. This will help you keep your taste buds alert to the precise flavors in your dishes., Always season your food at the temperature you intend to serve it. Hotter temperatures enhance flavors, while cooler temperatures diminish them. It is hard to tell the right flavor when the dish is at a higher or lower temperature than you intend to serve it.If you reheat leftovers, you usually have to salt them to taste afterwards to get the right flavor profile back.

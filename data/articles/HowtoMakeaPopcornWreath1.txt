 White cardboard looks best if you have plain popcorn, or any color that matches the popcorn.;
, Make it as large as you want the wreath to be.


At a minimum, the circle must be bigger than the popcorn, including the space for the center hole.
You can use any other shape you'd like, such as a heart, oval, square, star, and so forth.
 If using another shape, cut the middle in that same shape. In each case, leave an edging on which the popcorn will be affixed.


Don't make the edge portion too thin or too thick. If it's too thin, the popcorn won't have anything to affix to and the wreath may tear. If it's too thick, you'll be gluing on popcorn for ages.
 Using a hot glue gun, start gluing the popcorn to the wreath. This can be done either in row formation or randomly.
 Allow to completely dry.
 This will be used for hanging. If wished, you can also glue a bow onto the hanging piece.
 Choose somewhere that the wreath won't get wet or blown about too much; it's fragile and is best used indoors.

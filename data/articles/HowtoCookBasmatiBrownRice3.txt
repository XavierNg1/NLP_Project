 There are a variety of rice cookers on the market, and they don’t all operate in the same way or have the same features.


For instance, some will have both white and brown rice settings. Others won’t have either.
 Use a wooden spoon or rice paddle spoon to mix 2 cups (470 ml) brown basmati rice and 3 cups (710 ml) of water into the inner pot of the rice cooker.Many rice cookers come with a dry measuring cup. However, they’re often only equivalent to to 3/4 of a standard cup.
Don’t use metal utensils when mixing or scooping because they can damage the non-stick coating of the inner pots.
 Generally rice cookers have two settings – cook and warm – so make sure you select cook. This will bring the water to a boil very quickly.


Once the rice has absorbed all the water, the temperature will rise past the boiling point of water (100˚C/212˚F). At this point, most rice cookers will then automatically switch to the warm setting.
This will typically take about 30 minutes.
The warm setting will hold the rice at a safe serving temperature until you turn off the cooker.
 As with the boiling method, don’t lift the lid while the rice is cooking or the water vapor needed to cook it will disperse., After it switches to warm, keep the lid closed and let the rice sit for 5-10 minutes to finish cooking., Carefully open the lid away from your face to avoid being burned by any excess steam. Use a wooden or rice paddle spoon to gently fluff the rice. , You can serve it now or save it for later in the refrigerator or freezer.


If refrigerating, put the rice into a bowl and cover with a lid or saran wrap. It should keep for 3-4 days. Don't leave it out for more than two hours before refrigerating.
If freezing, rinse it in cool water, place portions in zip lock bags and place them in the freezer. Thaw the rice in the baggies overnight in the refrigerator.

 You can offset your carbon footprint by planting trees in your area. Make sure you plant them on your own land or with a project that has gained permission to plant.
 Organize the donation of land, seeds, soil and other necessary gardening gear from local businesses. Set up plots and teach local students or low income families to feed themselves.
 Find a class that teaches recycled materials in gardens, or take a class about planting microgreens or canning your own vegetables.
 Collect a glass vials or small boxes for each person you want to give a kit to.


Collect seeds that you use and that are easy to cultivate. Choose a variety of herbs, flowers and plants that grow outdoors without needing to be planted inside and transplanted later on.
Make a small card that fits squarely into your container. Glue 1 seed from each plant to the card and write the name of the plant next to them. Allow the glue to dry, and then place your card inside your small box or roll it up into a vial.
Pour more seeds inside the container. The person will use the seed card as a guide. Write a short note of encouragement to the person and place it inside. Wrap it up with ribbon and other embellishments.

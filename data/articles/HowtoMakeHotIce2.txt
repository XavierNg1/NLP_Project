 Although this is an inexpensive, nontoxic ingredient, it’s not commonly available in local stores. You'll probably have an easier time buying it online. (You may be able to take it from a squeeze-activated warming pad instead.)









Sodium acetate is also sold as "sodium acetate anhydrous," and some vendors do not specify which form they mean. The instructions below cover both forms.
 Place the sodium acetate in a steel or Pyrex container, then place that container in a pot of boiling water. It should melt to pure liquid sodium acetate trihydrate, or "hot ice."









If the sodium acetate does not melt, you've bought sodium acetate anhydrous. To turn it into sodium acetate trihydrate, add hot water while it's still in the boiling water bath. It will take about 2 mL water for every 3 grams of sodium acetate to fully dissolve the substance.
Don't use all of your sodium acetate. You'll need a little for later.
 Transfer to a clean container, cover, and place in an ice bath or fridge until it reaches room temperature or below. Make sure not to get any solid sodium acetate in this container, or it will freeze too early.
 The solid crystal is a nucleation point, meaning it allows the other sodium acetate molecules to stick around it and expand into a crystal form. Soon the whole container should look like a block of ice — except it's radiating heat!









Other impurities can trigger the freezing if they happen to be the right shape. This means you can sometimes trigger it by touching it with a toothpick or your finger, but solid sodium acetate is the only reliable way.

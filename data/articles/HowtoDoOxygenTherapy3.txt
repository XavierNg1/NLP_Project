 Short-term oxygen therapy is undertaken at hospitals, in a doctor’s office, or in other medical settings to help raise blood oxygen levels after a temporary drop. A doctor will often prescribe oxygen treatment after checking blood oxygen levels. Typically, patients are unaware that they need oxygen, so diagnosis from a medical professional is necessary.Short-term low oxygen levels are often caused by other conditions including an asthma attack, COPD, or complications with pneumonia. Let your doctor know if you’ve had any other symptoms or illnesses recently so that they can develop a proper treatment plan.
 Checking blood oxygen levels is necessary to determine whether a patient needs oxygen therapy. A medical professional will use pulse oximetry, an indirect test done using a finger probe. Such testing is typically fast and causes no pain., Once your doctor has prescribed short-term oxygen therapy and tested your blood oxygen levels, they will administer the treatment. Oxygen can be provided in a number of ways, but is typically administered through a face mask or breathing tubes.Some conditions, including decompression sickness, may require hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This is different than short-term oxygen therapy, and involves the patient being placed in a pressurized room or tube of pure oxygen.

 On your dock, locate the Applications app. It usually looks like a folder with a circled letter A. Click on it to launch it.
 Once you've opened the Applications app, scroll down until you find Utilities. Click on it.
 From with the Utilities folder, scroll down until you reach the app called Terminal. The app's icon is a black square. Click on Terminal.
 Once you've opened Terminal, click on the new window, and enter the following command: sudo ifconfig en0 ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx. Note that the 12 X characters need to be replaced with actual values. You can make up a combination of your choice, as long as you only use letters A to F and numbers. You might want to follow the format below with your own combination.


An example combination might be: sudo ifconfig en0 ether d4:33:a3:ed:f2:12
If the above command doesn't work, try the following: sudo ifconfig en1 Wi-Fi xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx (replace Xs with your own combination).
 Then, enter your password to register the new address.
 After having entered your new MAC Address, type in the following: ifconfig en0 |grep ether. This action will confirm your change of address.

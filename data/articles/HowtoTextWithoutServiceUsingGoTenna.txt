 GoTenna sells for $149.99 a pair (for now)—good for use on two devices. Currently, you can only purchase GoTenna online from its official website. If you plan on using it on multiple devices, they also offer a Family Pack consisting of 4 GoTenna.;
, Pull the extendable antenna (the black end) of the device to switch it on and enable it. The LED status indicator on the middle of the device will light up, notifying that it’s switched on.
 Go to your smartphone’s device settings and set its Bluetooth feature to “On.” A list of nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices will show up on the screen of your smartphone.
 Select “GoTenna” from the list of nearby Bluetooth devices on the screen of your phone to begin connecting. Your smartphone will pair with the GoTenna, allowing constant Bluetooth connectivity between the two at all times. Once pairing is complete, a notification will appear on your phone’s screen, and you can now start using it.
 GoTenna is a closed system, meaning you can only use GoTenna to send text messages, when there is no service, to other GoTenna users only. Since GoTenna comes in pairs, just connect via Bluetooth the other phone you’re planning to send text messages to.


You can skip this step if the phone you’re trying to send the text message to is already using GoTenna.
 Tap “Messages” from the application screen of your smartphone to open its messaging application.
 Begin typing the text message you want to send, and choose the number of the other phone you want to send it to.
 Press the “Send” button to send the text message to the other phone. GoTenna will then send long-range radio waves to the GoTenna of the phone you sent the text message to, delivering it even without a network service. GoTenna will then send the message to the phone it’s connected to, via Bluetooth, for the receiving person to read.

 One of the reasons people don’t leave a carrier they’re unhappy with is because of the dreaded ETF. However, carriers do prorate their ETF, basing the amount owed on the time remaining in your contract.Call your carrier to determine the amount you’d be liable for if you terminated your agreement. You can also look here for an ETF calculator.
 Once you’ve figured out what your ETF is, research other major carriers (the major carriers are usually considered to be Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile) to find a plan that works for you. Once you’ve done that, contact the carrier to see if it would be willing to absorb your ETF if you made the switch to their service., You don’t have to be locked in to one of the major carriers to get a satisfactory cellphone plan. It may be worth your while to consider:


A smaller local carrier. These carriers (like Cincinnati Bell and Cellular South) usually offer a variety of fairly cheap plans. However, you’d have to check as to whether or not the carrier requires a contract. Most—if not all— smaller local carriers have nationwide calling.

Unlike the major carriers, these service providers (such as Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile) don’t have their own network infrastructure. Rather, they purchase the excess capacity of the larger carriers.Many MVNOs don’t require contracts. However, you’d have to check with the individual carrier to see if it would be willing to pay your ETF on an early termination of your existing contract.

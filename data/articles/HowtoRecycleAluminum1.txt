 Make it easier to remember to recycle aluminum by designating a bin for all of your recyclables. Place the bin in your kitchen so that it will serve as a reminder to recycle as you are cooking and eating. This bin can be a regular trash can that now only accepts recyclables, a plastic container, or even a brown paper bag. Place your recycling bin next to your trash can and make sure that your whole family knows what can and cannot go in it. Of course, aluminum products like soda cans and foil can definitely be placed in the bin.

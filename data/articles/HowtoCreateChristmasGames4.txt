 Each person should evenly smear their chin area with Vaseline. Be sure that each person has about the same amount of Vaseline, to ensure that it's fair.
 Then, line up with the rest of your team on the other side.
 Dunk your face in so that as much cotton as possible sticks to the Vaseline.
 Tag the first person so that they can repeat the process.
 Give three points to the team who finished the fastest, and then an additional point for each cotton ball. The team with the most points wins!

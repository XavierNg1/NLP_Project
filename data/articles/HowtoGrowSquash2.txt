 Start them indoors two weeks before the last frost date.
 They prefer soil at 70℉ (20℃) to germinate in the garden. They are often more likely to die of frost when young than summer squash.
 Winter squash vines need a larger area than do summer varieties.You can also plant them near a trellis or metal fence so that they will vine vertically.
 You will need to thin them to two to three plants per hill once they are growing strong.
 Watering less frequently than every day encourages deeper root systems which will more readily withstand the heat of the summer months. Squash plants, typically, need a minimum of 1" (2.5cm) of rain or irrigation water each week. Soak underneath the plants to avoid powdery mildew.Fertilize them once per month.



Take care to clean all of the old plants from the garden area after the harvest. This reduces the places where the squash borers can overwinter.
Squash hanging on trellises are less likely to attract garden pests.
 It can take 75 to 120 days for them to completely mature. When ready for harvest, their hard skins should resist breaking if poked by a fingernail.
 Store in a cool, dry place. Some varieties need to be eaten within a week or two, while others can be stored individually for up to three months.

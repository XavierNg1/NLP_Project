 Bloody diarrhea is a symptom that needs immediate vet attention, so it's important to know what to look for. A cat may have blood in their feces from the small or large intestine. Blood originating in one of the parts of the intestine will look different. Blood in diarrhea from the large intestine will be red and look like blood. You may see the blood on the litter and sides of the litter box, too.Blood from the small intestine will be black or brown in color. The blood may look like dark flecks or specks on the feces, or it may look like coffee grounds.
Dark or brown blood may be difficult to identify, so it's important to look for anything that looks abnormal.
 The vet can better diagnose the cause and find a treatment of the bloody diarrhea if they know how suddenly it started. Acute diarrhea means that it started suddenly. Chronic diarrhea is when the cat has diarrhea for several weeks.Intermittent diarrhea is when the cat has diarrhea, but it goes away, but it comes back again. This happens over several weeks.
 Diarrhea may occur with other symptoms. The cat may stop eating and lose weight. They may become dehydrated or become thirstier than usual. The cat may also have fat and mucus in their feces. Some cats with diarrhea will eliminate outside of the litter box because they canâ€™t control it.Cats may also experience flatulence.
Being able to give the vet additional symptoms that occur alongside the bloody diarrhea can help them better diagnose the underlying condition and find the appropriate treatment.

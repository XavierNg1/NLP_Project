 All Pokémon games have at least one requirement you must fulfill to start trading Pokémon with other players. In Platinum, Diamond, and Pearl, you must have a Pokedex and at least two Pokémon in your party before you can trade.
 Some Pokémon are only available in certain versions of the game. If you are having trouble catching Pikachu, or if want to have it on your team before you've collected the necessary number of badges and completed certain plot points, you can trade one of your version exclusive Pokémon for a Pikachu with a friend.


Pearl, Diamond, and Platinum have a long list of Pokémon exclusive to each game. Search, "Pokemon exclusive to " online, to find a comprehensive list.
 These are located in the downstairs of your local Pokémon Center. There you should find two women standing at the center counter. When you speak with them, they will ask you if you'd like to use the Nintendo WFC. Select "Yes" from the options.
 To establish your connection to the Wi-Fi Club, you will need to choose "Yes" twice to save your game, and then one more time to begin the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.

Each of your friends' will have an icon by their name, indicating what they are doing (Recruiting Battle, Recruiting Trade, Battling, Trading, Voice Chatting, Standing By, or Voice Chat Off).Use the "apply" option to join a friend who is inviting you to battle or trade.
Use the "invite" option to request a friend join you in a battle or trade.

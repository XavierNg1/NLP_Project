 Although many plants aren't toxic to humans, they can be toxic to your cats. You shouldn't keep toxic plants in your house just in case your cat decides to eat them. Some common indoor plants that are toxic to cats include:Lillies
Ferns
Rubber plant
Primrose
Poinsettia

, If you're looking to buy new houseplants, check to see which plants are non-toxic. Once you've selected a few non-toxic plants, ensure that they haven't been sprayed with toxic chemicals that could harm your cats. These indoor houseplants are generally non-toxic:African violet
Orchid
Bamboo
Begonia
Spider plant
Prayer plant

, Pay attention to the types of plants that your cats try to eat and the types of plants your cats avoid. Look for indoor plants that won't attract your cats. Or if your cats don't like the smell of certain plants, buy them and place them near other plants to prevent your cats from eating them.This will make it easier to stop them from eating the plants since they won't be as interested in them.


For example, if your cats try to eat long, trailing plants, choose short, stocky plants instead.

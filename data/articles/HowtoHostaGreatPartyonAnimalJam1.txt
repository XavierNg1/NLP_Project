 Spooky, fantasy and disco are some good ideas. Before choosing, make sure that you have the items needed to make this theme a reality. Spooky may be a bit harder, since spooky items are usually only stocked during October.;
, If you are non-member, skip this step. For an example, you wouldn't use a volcano den for an ice party. That just doesn't make sense. For a fantasy party, use a fantasy castle. Be aware that some dens cost diamonds, so you will just have to improvise.
 Now that you have your theme and den ready, your den must be looking pretty bare. Use items that match your theme, as said before. For a fire party, use fire drums and possibly a fireplace.

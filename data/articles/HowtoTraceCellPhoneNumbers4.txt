 "Reverse cell phone lookup" websites are notorious for scamming customers, either by failing to provide any useful information for their money or by willfully stealing the customer's credit card information.
 The the better business bureau directory is a good place to look in addition to ordinary search engine queries.
 Do not enter your credit card number if your browser warns you that the website is insecure, if the site asks you to pay using a third party website you've never heard of, or if the site seems "sketchy" and unprofessional.


This includes "free trials" that claim your card will not be charged.
Try to find a service that has you pay using PayPal or another well-known third-party system.
 Your social security number and similar private information is never required for a legitimate phone lookup service.

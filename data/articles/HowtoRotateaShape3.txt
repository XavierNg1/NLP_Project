 Rotating a shape 270 degrees is the same as rotating it 90 degrees clockwise. Conventionally, shapes are rotated counterclockwise on a coordinate plane.You should assume this, unless it is noted in the problem that you need to rotate clockwise.

For example, if the problem states, “Rotate the shape 270 degrees around the origin,” you can assume you are rotating the shape counterclockwise. 

You would complete this problem the same way you complete a problem that asks “Rotate the shape 90 degrees clockwise around the origin.”

You might also see, “Rotate this shape -90 degrees around the origin.”




, This information should be provided, or you should be able to easily find the coordinates by looking at the coordinate plane.

For example, you might have a triangle with points (4, 6), (1, 2), and (1, 8).
 The formula is (x,y)→(y,−x){\displaystyle (x,y)\rightarrow (y,-x)}.It shows you that are reflecting the shape, then flipping it., Make sure you plug the correct x and y values into the new coordinate pair. In this formula, the x and y values are reversed, and you take the negative value of the x coordinate.

For example, the points (4, 6), (1, 2), and (1, 8) become (6, -4), (2, -1), and (8, -1).
 Draw the new points on the plane. Use a straightedge to connect them. The resulting shape shows the original shape rotated 270 degrees around the origin.

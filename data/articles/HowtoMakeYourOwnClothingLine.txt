 Write down as many ideas as you can think of, then choose your favorite.;
, This will influence not only your designs, but the prices of your designs too. Are you going to make your designs from scratch or create a recycled clothing line?

, Buy a sketchbook to design clothes in and keep this with you at all times. If you spot anything that inspires you, make a note of it in your sketchbook so you can think about how you could incorporate it into your designs. Don't just look at other clothes for inspiration, take inspiration from nature and architecture too.
 Make sure you know what kind of fabrics will work with your designs. If you make a design which relies on structure out of a thin, floaty fabric it won't look right.
 Buy fabric and start making your clothes. If you are going to use a lot of fabric it is cheaper to buy it from wholesalers by the roll than from a fabric store by the metre.
 There are websites which cater for people selling handmade goods,(such as Etsy.com) check them out and see if you could sell your designs there. If you are successful, you could start up your own website for your clothing line.

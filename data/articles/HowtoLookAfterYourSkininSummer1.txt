 Think about how quickly you burn on a sunny day. Multiply that number in minutes by the sun protection factor (SPF) of the sunscreen you're considering. The result will tell you the maximum amount of time the sunscreen will keep you protected.For example, if your skin turns red after 10 minutes in the sun, a sunscreen with SPF 15 should allow you to spend 150 minutes (2.5 hours) in the sun.;
, There's no proof that SPFs higher than 35 protect you for longer periods of time. They may simply contain more chemicals.Check the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep Cosmetics Database for information about each sunscreen on the market., The sun emits ultraviolet (UV) light in long-wave (UVA) and shortwave (UVB) rays. Both can cause skin cancer, but not all sunscreens contain UVB protection. Check the front of the packaging for terms like “Broad Spectrum.” This indicates protection from both kinds of UV rays., Mineral sunscreens don't contain the irritants that many chemical sunscreens contain. Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are the most common. If you're prone acne, stick to the zinc oxide. Titanium dioxide can make you break out., Read the packaging carefully. Look for oil-free formulas. If you have acne-prone skin, purchase sunscreens labeled “Non-Comedogenic.” These formulas won't clog your pores., Look for terms like “cream,” “lotion,” or even “ointment” on the front of the packaging. Moisturizing sunscreens are often formulated as these skincare products. Check for moisturizing ingredients like oil and lanolin.

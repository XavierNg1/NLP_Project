Size H crochet hook
Scissors

, Make a chain of 26 stitches to start your crunch stitch washcloth.You will be working this chain in the crunch stitch.


This chain size will make an approximately 8 inch square washcloth. If you want your washcloth to be larger or smaller, adjust the number of stitches according to your yarn gauge.
 Start by doing a slipstitch into the second chain from the hook.After the slipstitch, use a double crochet stitch on the next stitch.Repeat this pattern to end of row. Continue to alternate between the slipstitch and half-double crochet stitches until the end of the first row., When your reach the end of the row, turn the stitches around and chain two stitches.This will be your turning chain for your second row. You will need to make a turning chain for every even row until you complete the washcloth.
 After you chain two new stitches, slipstitch into the first stitch in the row and then follow with a half-double crochet. Continue to alternate between the slipstitch and HDC to the end of the row., For the third row and all odd rows after this one, start with a slipstitch. Do not chain two at the start of this row. Just slipstitch and then follow with a half-double crochet.Turn when you reach the end of the row and then repeat the pattern that you used for row two.


Alternate between rows two and three until washcloth measures 8 inches.,

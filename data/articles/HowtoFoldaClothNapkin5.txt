 Fold napkin in half (horizontally) and then in half again.
 Take each of the loose corners, one at a time, and fold it up to the top corner. Leave just a little space between them each time (about .5-1 centimeter between each edge).
 Carefully holding the folds, flip the napkin over.
 Fold both the left and right sides, one at a time, until their points hit at roughly the first third from the top center point and they begin to form a triangle or Christmas tree shape. Overall, it should look like a kite at this point.
, Fold up the first layer to the top, forming a tight triangle and the peak of the Christmas tree. Fold each subsequent layer up, folding the tip underneath each layer above it. This will form the layers of the tree.
 Once all the layers are folded, you are done! Enjoy your Christmas tree napkin.

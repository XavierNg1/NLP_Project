 Before you get started, you need to determine what the last consecutive number in your set will be. This formula can help you add any number of consecutive odd numbers starting with 1.If you're working on an assignment, this number will be given to you. For example, if the question asks you to find the sum of all consecutive odd numbers between 1 and 81, your ending point is 81.;
, The next step is to simply add 1 to your ending point. You should now have an even number, which is essential for the next step.


For example, if your ending point is 81, 81 + 1 = 82.
 Once you have an even number, you should divide this by 2. This will give you an odd number that is equal to the number of digits that are being added together.


For example, 82 / 2 = 41.
 The last step is to square the number, or multiply it by itself. Once you do this, you will have your answer.


For example, 41 x 41 = 1681. This means the sum of all consecutive odd numbers between 1 and 81 is 1681.
 The key to understanding this formula is to recognize the underlying pattern. The sum of any set of consecutive odd numbers starting with 1 is always equal to the square of the number of digits that were added together.


Sum of first odd number = 1
Sum of first two odd numbers = 1 + 3 = 4 (= 2 x 2).
Sum of first three odd numbers = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 (= 3 x 3).
Sum of first four odd numbers = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 (= 4 x 4).
 By solving this problem, you learned more than the sum of the numbers. You also learned how many consecutive digits were added together: 41! This is because the number of digits added together is always equal to the square root of the sum.


Sum of first odd number = 1. The square root of 1 is 1, and only one digit was added.
Sum of first two odd numbers = 1 + 3 = 4. The square root of 4 is 2, and two digits were added.
Sum of first three odd numbers = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. The square root of 9 is 3, and three digits were added.
Sum of first four odd numbers = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. The square root of 16 is 4, and four digits were added.
 Once you understand the formula and how it works, you can write it down in a format that will be applicable no matter what numbers you are dealing with. The formula to find the sum of the first n odd numbers is n x n or n squared.


For example, if you plugged 41 in for n, you would have 41 x 41, or 1681, which is equal to the sum of the first 41 odd numbers.
If you don't know how many numbers you are dealing with, the formula to determine the sum between 1 and n is (1/2(n + 1))2


, If you are given a series of consecutive odd numbers and are asked to find their sum, you should use the (1/2(n + 1))2 equation. If, on the other hand, you have been given a sum and asked to find the series of consecutive odd numbers that adds up to that sum, you will need to use a different formula all together.
 To find out what consecutive odd numbers add up to a given sum, you will have to create an algebraic formula. Start by using n to represent the first number in the sequence.,


This means the second number in the series will be n + 2, the third will be n + 4, etc.
 Once you know how to represent each number in the series, it is time to write out your formula. The left side of your formula should represent the numbers in the series, and the right side should represent their sum.


For example, if you have been asked to find a series of two consecutive odd numbers that add up to 128, you would write n + n + 2 = 128.
 If you have more than one n on the left side of your equation, add them together. This will make it much easier to solve.


For example, n + n + 2 = 128 simplifies to 2n + 2 = 128.
 Remember that whatever changes you make to one side of the equation, you must make to the other side as well.


Deal with addition and subtraction first. In this case, you need to subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to get n by itself , so 2n = 126.
Then deal with multiplication and division. In this case, you need to divide both sides by 2 in order to isolate n, so n = 113.
 At this point, you know that n = 113, but you are not quite done. You need to make sure that you completely answer the question that was asked. If the question asks you what series of consecutive numbers adds up to a given sum, you must write out all of the numbers.


The answer to this problem is 113 and 115 because n = 113 and n + 2 = 115.
It's always a good idea to check your work by plugging your numbers back into the equation. If they don't equal the given sum, go back and try again.

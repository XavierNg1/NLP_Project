 You must have at least two columns of information for Vlookup to work, but you can have as many as you need

, In the cell, enter this formula: =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, range_lookup).


You can use any cell to write this is, but remember that whatever cell you choose is entered as the “lookup value” in your function code.
Refer to the guide above for the information about what each of those values should be. Following our same example of a student list using the aforementioned values, our Vlookup formula would look like this: =VLOOKUP(F3,A2:B32,2,FALSE), Select the cell with your Vlookup code. In the bottom right corner, select the cell handle and drag it to include one or more other cells.


This allows you to search using Vlookup, because you must have at least two cells in order to have an input/output of information.
You can enter the purpose of each cell in an adjacent (but not joined) cell. For example, to the left of the box where you search for a student, you can put “Student Names.”

, To do this, enter the lookup value, as per our example it would be the name of a student, in one of the cells that you included in your Vlookup code. Then, Vlookup should automatically supply you with the grade of said student in the adjoined cell.

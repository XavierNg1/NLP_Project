 Before buying followers, you'll want to make sure your financial security isn't in danger. PayPal is your best bet, since it is free and it hides your sensitive credentials.;
, This will give you a general idea of the most popular results (e.g., what other people are using).

The most popular results are not the one that labeled as advertising. Better to see the several options from organic search., Popular Instagram follower outlets vary, so you'll want to look for a couple of consistent factors and discard any outliers:


Follower packages that average less than $0.10/follower
PayPal as an accepted method of payment
A privacy guarantee

, Sometimes paid follower sites sneak items such as disappearing followers or the right to spam your existing followers into the fine print. If you see an item you disagree with, don't pay for the service.
 If the service has been around for long enough--as most reputable ones have been--you'll probably be able to find reviews for it.


If you find an overwhelmingly negative series of reviews for your selected service, look for a different service.
 Most sites offer various packages with different numbers of followers. Both the number of your posts and the length of time you've been on Instagram will factor into this decision.


For example, if you've only been on Instagram for a day and you have one post, it doesn't make much sense for you to have more than 50 or so followers.
You should also take your current number of followers into account when doing this. If you double your follower intake overnight without changing your content, people may get suspicious.
 Even though PayPal is a secure intermediary, you shouldn't risk paying for followers over an unsecure connection (or data).
 This will ensure the seller will never see your credit card details. If you're set on your service and you think it's reputable, you can now purchase your Instagram followers.

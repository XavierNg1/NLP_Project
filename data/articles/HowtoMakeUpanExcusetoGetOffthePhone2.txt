 If they ask you about it, say that you must have been disconnected.


Of course, if you don't bother calling back, this comes across as just plain rude. Mostly because it is.
 Bring it towards the mouthpiece, and start crushing it more and more. This will create a crackling sound, similar to the one made when there's a disturbance in the phone line. Say that he/she is cracking up,you can't hear what they're saying and hang up.
 Play the recording holding the speaker so that is sort of sounds like it's coming from a little further away, then say "I got to go, get back to you later" and hang up.

 Cats need to be able to reach up as high as they can to scratch and stretch. If the scratching post is too short, your cat may not even look at it. The post should be high enough to allow your cat to stand on her back legs and reach above her head with her front paws.;
, To make sure your cat’s scratching post is stable, try fixing it to a surface or making sure the post has a sturdy base so it won’t budge when the cat scratches it. If your cat feels the post move or shift, she won't feel secure and may refuse to use the post.


Scratching boards which you lean against a wall or hang like a picture are unpopular with most cats.
 Individual cats favor different textures to scratch on. If you are not sure what your cat likes, a good starter scratcher is natural rope wound around a sturdy column.Avoid plastic ropes or artificial fibers because these materials can create static, which cats dislike.
If your cat likes to scratch carpet, then consider nailing a piece of carpet to a sturdy post.
Other textures to consider trying include corrugated cardboard, and cloth.
 Chances are that your cat likes to scratch in more than just one spot, so plan to purchase or create more than one scratching post in your house. Having multiple posts will ensure that your cat always has access to a scratching post where ever she is. Having multiple posts is even more important if you have multiple cats.

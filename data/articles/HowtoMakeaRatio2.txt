 The ratio simply represents the relationship between two quantities. "5 apples to 3 pears" is the same as "3 pears to 5 apples." Therefore, 5 apples/ 3 pears = 3 pears/ 5 apples.
 For example, the probability of rolling a 2 on a die is 1/6, or one out of six. Note: if you're using a ratio to denote probability, then the order of quantities does matter.
 Though you may be used to simplifying numbers whenever you can, it can benefit you to scale a ratio up. For example, if you know that you'll need 2 cups of water for every 1 cup of pasta you boil (2 cups water/1 cup pasta), but you want to boil 2 cups of pasta, then you'll need to scale up the ratio to know how much water to use. To scale up a ratio, simply multiply the top and bottom by the same number.


2 cups water/ 1 cup pasta * 2/ 2 = 4 cups water/ 2 cups pasta. You'll need 4 cups of water to boil 2 cups of pasta.

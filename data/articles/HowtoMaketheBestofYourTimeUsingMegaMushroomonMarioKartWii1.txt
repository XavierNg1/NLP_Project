 You can be in blue shell position by being first or simply the closest to finishing at the finish line.


Start with your mega mushroom. For advanced items, get it in 5th or 6th position. For Balanced, 6th or 7th and Strategic, 7th, 8th, or 9th.

When you have your Mega Mushroom, Move into "Blue Shell Position." Once you see the blue shell "Warning" and you hear the repetitive bleeping noise press up on d-pad for Wii Wheel and also up on the nunchucks. If timed and done right, the blue shell should explode on you and you should come out unharmed.

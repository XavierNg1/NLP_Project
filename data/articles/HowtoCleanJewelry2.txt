 The tarnish that accumulates on silver jewelry can often be removed with a solution made from salt, water and aluminum foil. The salt and aluminum foil act as a magnet that draws the tarnish from the silver.









Line a bowl with aluminum foil and fill it up with hot water. Add a tablespoon of salt and stir until it dissolves.
Place your silver jewelry in the bowl and let it sit for several minutes.
Remove your jewelry from the bowl and dry it off using a soft cloth.
 The ingredients in toothpaste that help your teeth get clean can also be used to clean silver. Apply a dab of toothpaste to your silver jewelry and use a soft cloth to rub it in. Rinse the jewelry and dry it off using a clean cloth.









You can use a soft-bristled toothbrush to help loosen stubborn tarnish.
Avoid using a hard-bristled toothbrush or other brush on silver, since you may accidentally scratch its surface.
 Silver cleaner comes in paste or dip form. It's an effective cleaning tool, but it contains harsh chemicals and should only be used if other methods don't work. Wear gloves to protect your hands when you use silver cleaner, and don't use this method for jewelry that contains pearls or gemstones.









To use silver cleaner paste, apply a small amount to your jewelry and use a soft cloth to rub it in a straight motion across the jewelry (rubbing in circles can be too abrasive). When you're finished, rinse the jewelry off and dry it with a soft cloth.
To use silver cleaner dip, pour a small amount of the solution into a bowl and place your jewelry in the solution. Let it soak for the time recommended on the packaging, which should be no more than a minute or two. Remove the jewelry and rinse it off, then dry it with a soft cloth.

 Religious organizations such as churches, mosques, and synagogues do not need to apply for tax-exempt recognition. Instead, they are automatically tax exempt if they meet the IRS requirements.For this reason, many will not appear in the IRS Exempt Organization List. Check whether the religious organization meets the following requirements:


It has been organized exclusively for religious purposes.
Net earnings do not benefit any private individual or shareholder. The organization can pay a minister or other faith leader a reasonable salary. However, it cannot pay an excessive salary or transfer property to any insider for less than market value.
The organization cannot be substantially involved in influencing legislation. For example, it cannot encourage members to contact politicians either in support or in opposition to legislation.
The religious organization cannot participate in political campaigns. Although a church might invite a political candidate to speak, it should provide an opportunity for opposing candidates to speak as well.
The organization’s purpose and activities cannot be illegal.

 The idea is to keep your inbox clear, so create folders that will file all the complete contents of your email, minus the junk.;
, Make sure that you do use this tool accordingly, however, and that you don't just label them all "urgent" in an attempt to just push off dealing with them to another time. Doing so will just defeat the purpose of managing your email in the first place.
 Besides the obvious information, such as your position and address, make sure that your signature also includes a website or blog, should you have them.
 Create groups in advance, and where necessary, by dividing your contacts into groups also.
 This habit will make you more productive during the day, as long as you take that time to actively deal with all the email you receive, whether that means responding to certain emails or deleting them. Checking your email at specific times will ensure that you respond to them in a group.
 Ideally, you want to browse your email subject lines to determine which emails can be deleted without reading them. This would include junk email and obvious spam. Filtering your messages in this manner will make it less daunting dealing with the remaining new messages.
 Take 1 email at a time and deal with it then and there, if possible. You don't want to leave emails until later or read all your emails before going back and responding to them.
 Not only will this make the process of email management easier but it will be beneficial to the respondent of your message, especially if that person is equally overwhelmed. Therefore, when writing a brief email, make sure you stick to the point and narrow your message down to the essentials.

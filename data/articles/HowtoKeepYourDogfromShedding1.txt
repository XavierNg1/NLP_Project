, Start brushing your dog as early as three weeks old, and make it a daily process. Use praise and petting to make it an enjoyable experience for your puppy and to keep it interested in being groomed. Use a firm, assertive voice to encourage your dog to stay still while being brushed, but avoid sounding aggressive, which could cause negative associations for your pet., Try to brush your dog every day to keep shedding to a minimum. Choose a time when your dog will be calm and cooperative (e.g. after its evening walk) and do your best to maintain the routine. Choose a brushing spot that is comfortable for both you and your pet, and cover the area with a sheet or blanket to catch stray hair.

 Measure the dimensions before hand, then go to the stationery store and purchase a locker shelf (if you don't already have one). Buy a black one for Halloween, and buy one in your favourite colour because they are usually cheap. Buy an orange locker mat and lay that on the locker's floor.This is your "blank canvas".



Buy a silver mirror with a fancy border to go on your locker door. Make sure it's silver if you use black and orange.
Buy orange, black and purple sticky notes. Peel off the last sticky note and stick them to your locker door.
Get some cotton buds from home, and rip them up or unwrap them. Fluff them out so that they look like spider webs, and hang them over the corners of your locker. Use an old dead flower, black feather, or a spider ring, and hang them carefully in the "webs".
Use orange washi tape to wrap around a mason jar. Place this somewhere in your locker to serve as a pen/pencil holder and a stationery holder.
 Some ideas of this could include:


Buy a wooden name plate and paint it orange/black/red/yellow/dark purple/dark green/ dark blue. Then, paint your name on with a golden/silver colour or use letter name stickers.
Again with the cotton buds, but hook them onto the name plate.
Attach the name plate to your locker door with either glue tack/blu(e) tack, sticky tape, or double sided tape.
If you can/are allowed to, use some wrapping paper in the theme colours and cut it to the size of your locker door but just a little bit smaller. Use double sided tape and stick it to the inside/outside/the back of your locker (door).

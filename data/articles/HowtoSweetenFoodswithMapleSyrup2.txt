 Using maple syrup instead of refined sugar or sugar substitutes can add a smooth, flavorful pop to your morning beverage. To do so, just make your coffee the way you always do, whether you customarily use a fancy French press, instant crystals, or a trusty Keurig.Consider making iced coffee if it’s hot outside and you want something refreshing.
If you're more of a tea person than a coffee person, try maple syrup in your tea instead! Maple goes particularly well with green tea and lemon flavors., Since it’s the first time you’re experimenting with maple syrup in your coffee, start with a teaspoon when first testing the new combo. Sip the result and decide if it’s sweet enough for your taste or not.
 Now simply add as much—or as little—maple syrup as you like! Just keep in mind that one tablespoon of maple syrup contains 52 calories and 12.4 grams of sugar.

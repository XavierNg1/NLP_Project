 A rash that is caused by allergies will generally look like swollen red bumps or circles. When your body releases histamine in response to an allergy, small blood vessels in your skin can expand and can cause the surrounding skin to swell up and become red.


These hives are one of the most visible ways to tell if you have allergies.
 Your top layer of skin (which is referred to in the medical world as your epidermis) contains special nerve fibers called C-fiber that create the sensation of feeling itchy. When your body reacts to an allergen, your skin cells can become inflamed, in turn affecting or damaging this C-fiber. When this damage occurs, you feel itchy.When you get allergies, the most common places you will feel itchy include your eyes, nose, ears, throat, lips, or around your mouth.
 When inflammation reaches the breathing tubes where air passes through, the tubes becomes narrow. This narrowing of your airways can lead to feeling like you can’t catch your breath or breathe in fully. This is called shortness of breath and can be very dangerous if the inflammation becomes too much.


If you are having trouble breathing, take an antihistamine (allergy medication), let someone know what you’re going through and, if necessary, get yourself to a hospital.
 The chemical histamine is released into nearby cells if your body’s immune system detects a harmful foreign body (in this case, allergens). Histamine causes small blood vessels in your body to expand and become inflamed. When this inflammation reaches your throat and airways, your breathing tubes become narrow, making it harder for you to breath. What results is a high-pitched whistling sound each time you breathe.

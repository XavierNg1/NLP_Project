 By weight, green beans to roasted beans should be weighed at a ratio of about 1.2:1. A larger volume of green beans will result in a slightly longer roasting time. Just a few scoops might provide a very light, open flavor and increasing the volume will offer more depth. See the Tips below for some guidelines.
 Stick around - watch, listen and smell as the roast progresses. Watch as the sugars slowly caramelize, the water evaporates and the oils begin to cook. After about 2 1/2 minutes of roasting, you’ll hear the beans begin to crack. At about 4-6 minutes, the second crack occurs and small shards will come off the beans, creating a crater appearance on some of the beans.
 and peer into the roaster. If you have a metal measuring scoop you can simply lower this into the popper to take a quick sample to judge for color of the beans.
 When you choose to stop the roast is entirely up to you but a good place is just into the second crack. After about 5 minutes you’ll have a good medium brown roast, and after 6 1/2 minutes you’ll have a great, dark, shiny roast. Any longer than this and the beans will start to burn. Just experiment with a few batches and you’ll soon discover what you like/dislike.

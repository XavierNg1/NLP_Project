 Using the wooden board, tape an end of the yarn, and wrap around. Do this 100 times.;
, Once you have 100 pieces, remove the tape, and cut off the middle of the yarn.
 Once you have cut the yarn, take one of your pieces of yarn that are the other color, and tie around the middle. Then you should pick it up and hold it by the string of the tie, so it looks like the end of a mop.
 Tie the yarn about three-quarters the way up from the bottom. This forms the head.
 Count off 25 pieces of yarn near the head, and section them. Once you have sectioned them, tie them around the middle. This should be an arm. Repeat for the other arm.
 Cut the yarn of the arms so about there is an inch left. These are the hands.
 At around the dolls mid section, you tie a piece of yarn. This is the dolls waist.
 For all ties, except the one growing off the head, clip them so they have no thread left.
 To make eyes, take a strand of yarn from the doll's face, and tie. Once you have tied, clip off the extra yarn and you have eyes. To make a mouth, do the same but tuck the extras under other strand of yarn.
 To make hair, take a clip of yarn, and tie it around the yarn that is hanging off the head.

 This recipe involves additional ingredients but it results in very strong clay that can be dropped from one meter high and not break., Mix 1 cup PVA glue, ½ tablespoon stearin (stearic acid), 1 ½ tablespoon glycerin, 1 ½ tablespoon Vaseline and ½ tablespoon citric acid in a non-stick pot over low heat. Mix completely.


Use the lowest heat possible to heat up the pot.
 Add the ½ cup cornstarch little by little into the mixture, stirring the whole time. Adding the cornstarch little by little prevents lumps from forming. Keep mixing the clay until you can lift the clay up from the pan.


It will get stickier and stickier and then heavier and very hard to stir but you must continue until you can lift it out of the pan.
 Place the clay on a table on top of non-stick paper (baking paper). It should be hot, a little sticky and a little lumpy. Knead the clay for about 20 minutes until all the lumps disappear and the clay becomes smooth and no longer sticky.


Allow the clay to cool down for a bit if it is still hot when you finish kneading.
 Store the clay in sealed plastic bags to prevent it from hardening before use. Make sure you press all the air out of the bag before sealing. Use the clay to make whatever you prefer and paint using acrylic paints.

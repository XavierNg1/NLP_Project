 Pasteurella is highly infectious, so you want to avoid introducing a sick rabbit into your existing rabbit household. When buying or rescuing a new rabbit, observe him closely to make sure the animal is not sneezing and has no discharges.Check to make sure there are no discharges from the ears or nose. These are signs of concern.
If the rabbit does have a nasal discharge, then the risk of introducing a problem into your house is high. Think carefully before taking on that rabbit.;
, When you bring a new rabbit home, keep him away from the other rabbits for a few days. This gives you a chance to check that the stress of rehoming hasn't triggered a bout of the snuffles.Opinions vary about how long to quarantine the new rabbit. Some say three to four days because if the stress of homing hasn't triggered a problem by then, you should be ok.
Others favor a much longer period, like two weeks. The longer isolation has to be balanced against the chance of socializing the new rabbit with your existing ones, which is best done when the rabbit is young.
If you have a rabbit that has the snuffles, you should isolate the rabbit while he undergoes treatment. Talk to your vet about how long he should stay away from your other rabbits to reduce the risk of spreading the infection.
 Another way to prevent the snuffles is to clean the rabbit's hutch and living area regularly. Do a spot clean everyday to scoop out bedding soiled with urine and replacing it with clean bedding. A rabbit living in dirty conditions is at high risk of developing the snuffles.Urine contains ammonia. A rabbit's respiratory tract is delicate and easily damaged by inhaling ammonia. Make sure the living quarters are well ventilated so fumes donâ€™t build up.

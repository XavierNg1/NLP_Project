 Unless you are dealing with a hobby collector, having a fairly detailed description of your guitar will go a long way to selling it. What make/model is it? What kinds of materials are used in your guitar? Is the body a solid unit, or is it laminated? What is the fretboard made out of? Does your guitar have any equipment upgrades that help it stand apart from the rest? What kind of paint finish does it have? Include as much of this information as you can in your advertisement, because buyers want to know that you are familiar with what you are selling and that they aren't driving all that way to see a guitar of questionable quality and origin.;
, If there is cosmetic damage to the instrument, it is bad form to hide it in your photographs and not be up front about it with potential buyers. Even with internal repairs, it is often worth the money to get the guitar fixed before it is sold. If there is extensive damage to any part of the guitar, be honest. Some buyers are looking for a guitar to restore, and you should adjust your price accordingly.
 Even if you are playing by yourself at home, most guitars have nuances that make them suitable for certain applications. Someone who is unfamiliar with your particular guitar might be tempted to buy it if they see that you play the same music as they do.
 Always place multiple pictures in your ads (if applicable), being sure to highlight features and the serial number. These pictures should be of high quality, so most cell phone pictures are not adequate. When someone comes to look at it, make sure it is clean, polished, and in tune before they arrive.
 Most online ad services are free, and offer the option of prime ad placement for a small amount of money. The premise here is simple: more coverage means more potential buyers.

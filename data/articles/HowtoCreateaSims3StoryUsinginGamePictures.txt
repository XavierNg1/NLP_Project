 The main tool for taking pictures is the free moving camera. To access this hit TAB. Use the arrow keys to move, Q and E to tilt up and down, and Z and X to zoom in and out.;
, Plot is the series of events that happen in a story. What is your story about? What happens? Like a house needs a good floor plan, your story needs a nice plot.
 Figure out what your characters are like. Remember the basic rules when making character: Have interesting characters with some conflict. Don't make your characters perfect, one needs a weakness and a strength.
 This lot will be your first "scene" or where your first pictures will be taken. Build what you need. Also make sure your house or lot has enough lighting/fits the mood of your pictures.
 Remember to take pictures of your sims acting out the plot, not just random things. Take pictures of your Sims that fit the text you will have. Pictures of something like your Sims back when your text refers to their face isn't right.
 Upload your pictures to somewhere like the Sims 3 Exchange, where many will see your work.

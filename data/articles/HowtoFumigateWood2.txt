 Fumigation will likely be regulated by your government. The gasses used are highly toxic. Enclosed areas under fumigation, such as homes, are not safe to enter. No matter the laws in your area, having a professional handle fumigation is always the best plan., Anything alive must be removed from the treatment area. This includes family, pets, plants, and seeds. Remove any opened food and medicine containers. You may also bring non-infested items such as clothing and toys so they arenâ€™t fumigated.Items that will stay in the area can be protected. Seal them in glass, metal, or gas-resistant bags.
Fumigants are toxic. It is possible for a gas such as Vikane to linger inside objects, such as beds and toys, for over a month.
 Rather than exposing your entire home to fumigation, bring infested objects outside. Set up a tarp to contain the chemicals. Safety equipment such as a gas mask can protect you, but you should not stay in the fumigation area. Either spray the chemicals quickly or pump them into the area., A fumigation tarp seals the entire area where fumigation takes place. The tarp holds in the chemicals, allowing them to settle. Set up the tarp as a tent. Close off any ventilation holes. Make sure there are no leakage points in the tarp., The best way to add in the fumigant is to use a pump. Professional companies pump the gas through the tarp so no one gets exposed to it. When treating smaller objects, such as furniture, you can usually spray the wood directly and exit the area before taking a breath., Home fumigation takes up to three days. Once the treatment is over, the tent can be removed so the gas dissipates. If you have a device that measures air quality, use this to determine how safe it is to go back into your home. Furniture treated outdoors can be moved back inside after treatment.You may still see insects other than termites. The gas may not have been in a high enough dosage to kill them.

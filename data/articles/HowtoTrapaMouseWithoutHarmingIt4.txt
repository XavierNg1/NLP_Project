 Even after you have successfully trapped a mouse and removed it from your home, you will want to make sure that other mice cannot get in your home.


Have any cracks in concrete or your foundation repaired by a professional.
Use steel wool (or copper wool) to block small or hard-to-reach holes.You should use a caulk to secure the steel wool in place.
 Mice dislike the pungent odor of peppermint, and it will keep them from coming into areas that are heavily peppermint scented.Buy peppermint extract from your local grocery store; then soak cotton balls in the peppermint oil. Lay the cotton balls around—or outside—your home in areas where you are concerned that mice may enter.
 Mice dislike the smell of dryer sheets, and will avoid an area in which dryer sheets have been placed.Although dryer sheets are light-weight and can blow away if placed outside, they work well indoors. If you want to use dryer sheets outside, use a small stone or two to weight down the corners.


You can also use dryer sheets to block holes in walls or concrete that mice may be sneaking in through.
Since the scent will wear off eventually, switch out the dryer sheets for new ones every month.
 Mice have acute senses of smell and, like many other invasive pests, usually come inside your home looking for a meal. Mice love to eat grains (including cereal and oatmeal), and will often gnaw through packaging to get at these foods. Keep grain products sealed in airtight containers.

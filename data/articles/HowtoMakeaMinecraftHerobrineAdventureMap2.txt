 If the villagers give tools and armor, make sure they are enchanted and the weapons are given names.


Food? Potions? You an add them too!

, It is recommended to give them weapons, but you may give them armor too! Have a base drop of all monster be your currency, this being the currency you use for your villagers.
 Some objects you are going to want won't be in the game, such as Herobrine himself or items. To do this, you will edit the appearance of certain blocks that already exist in the game.
 What`s better than adding Herobrine could be his apprentices or friends. Think of your own, and let the player know how to defeat the boss.


You may add the health bar for that boss too!
You may even add the Enderdragon and the Wither!
Make sure that the story must have bosses fought at the correct time. Or, you may put some in the Nether (which may of course include Herobrine).
 A giant spider with a scar that is it`s weak spot? An evil villager with a robot that shoots fire balls and summons minions? A giant skeleton that summons skeletons and dies when it explodes? Add them!

, His head must be a textured Steve head where there are no pupils. His actor is a zombie. Give him enchanted armor and an enchanted sword, you don't want the final boss to be that easy.
 Make sure it is completable, and everything works the way you intended it to. If something is wrong, be sure to fix it before releasing it.

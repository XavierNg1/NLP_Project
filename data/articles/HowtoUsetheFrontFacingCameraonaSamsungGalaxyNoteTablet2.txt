 If you use communication apps like Skype or Hangouts, you can use the front-facing camera to let your contacts see you while you talk to them. Do this by first launching your app of choice.
 Just tap on his or her name in your Contacts List.
 Do this by tapping the camera icon somewhere around their contact details screen.


The app should begin dialing the contact.
 By default, these apps use the front-facing camera, but in the event of the app using the rear-facing camera first, tap the camera icon on the bottom of the call screen.


On apps like Hangouts, the camera switch is done by tapping a toggle button on the bottom. The button will then change according to the camera you are using.
 Select the front camera, and the feed should switch to the webcam to show your face.

 In New Orleans, the Carnival season begins on King's Day (January 6th), and continues through Mardi Gras Day. A quick online search will let you know when to expect Fat Tuesday this year.;
, Since Mardi Gras is always on a Tuesday, you will probably want to host your party the weekend beforehand.
, Make your Mardi Gras party a masquerade, and ask people to wear masks and costumes. You can pick a theme like a 17th century ball (the attire of choice for many of the Mardi Gras balls in New Orleans), favorite celebrity or even characters from comic books or movies. Or, you can simply ask that your guests come in their favorite costume without giving the party a specific theme.
, Traditional food during Mardi Gras includes hot slow-cooked dishes like gumbo, red beans and rice, chili or jambalaya. Finger food is always welcome, as well as any food that is purple, green or gold. A King Cake is traditional.
 You can hang purple, green and gold streamers and beads along fences or the stairs. Add a Mardi Gras faux chandelier to the ceiling. Have fun -- thatâ€™s what Mardi Gras is all about.
 You can let the sound from the parades play, or download some traditional Mardi Gras music to use as the parade and party soundtrack.

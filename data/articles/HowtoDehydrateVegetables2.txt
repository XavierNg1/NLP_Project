 Set the temperature between 120 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. To dry vegetables faster, preheat the oven to 200 degrees. However, if you do so, lower the heat between 120 and 140 after the first hour of drying.Prolonged exposure to higher temperatures at 200 or higher will cause the vegetables to cook, rather than dry., Use an oven-safe stainless steel mesh screen as a drying tray so air can circulate underneath your veggies. Spread them so that no pieces touch each other, which will also improve air circulation. If you are filling more than one tray, do so with equal portions, so that each tray dries evenly.If you use a cookie sheet instead of a mesh screen, be sure to line it with baking paper before arranging your vegetables.
 If using a mesh screen as a tray, consider placing a sheet of aluminum foil on the rack below to catch any moisture that may drip. Keep the oven door open by at least a 3-inch crack. Allow the moisture from the vegetables to escape, as well as any excess heat, so that your oven maintains an even temperature of 140 degrees and no higher.Keep an eye on any pets or small children during this process.
 If using a cookie sheet, flip your veggies over so both sides are evenly dried. Reverse the placement of your tray if your oven doesnâ€™t heat up evenly. If drying more than one tray, rotate their positions.Do so every two hours, since some vegetables may dry in as little as three to four.
 Remove a piece from the tray and let it cool. Push your finger into the flesh to see if any juices come out. Gently try to bend it to see if it is too tough or brittle to do so. Return the piece to the oven if it bends without snapping or emits moisture when you press it. If not, remove the tray from the oven.

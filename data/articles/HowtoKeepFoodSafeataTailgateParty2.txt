 It's absolutely vital that your cold stuff stays cold. To this end:


Use an appliance thermometer to make sure your food stays below 40ºF/4.4ºC. Food that doesn't stay cold will start to go bad within two hours.
Use thermally lined/insulated picnic/lunch bags or coolers to keep foods cool. Add ice packs or ice to keep it even cooler. The food should be packed into these the moment it is removed from the refrigerator. Always allow for thorough chilling time if you're baking or cooking foods to take.
If you have a vehicle/portable fridge, keep your cold foods in it until they're ready to be used.
 If you're bringing hot food to the tailgate party, you must keep it hot.


To keep food like soup hot, take your insulated container, fill it with boiling water and let it sit for 2 minutes. Empty it and then fill the container with the piping hot food. This will keep the food steaming for several hours.
 Meat and poultry need to reach the correct internal temperature while grilling. So get out your food thermometer, and check the temperature before you serve:


Hamburger patties and pork need to reach at least 160ºF/71.1ºC
Chicken needs to hit a smoking hot 170ºF/76.6ºC before serving
Beef, lamb, and pork need to be cooked to 165ºF/73.8ºC
Medium rare beef, veal, and lamb steaks need to be cooked to 145ºF/62.7ºC
Poultry breast meat needs to be cooked to 170ºF/76.6ºC
Dark meat needs to be cooked to 180ºF/82.2ºC
All pork needs to be cooked to 160ºF/71.10C.

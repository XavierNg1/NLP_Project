 This is an essential step. By blindly wandering into a store and saying, 'I'd like to buy a games console' isn't helpful for you or the shop assistant. Check out what's available at the time - right now, the three hot shots are the Xbox One, the Sony Playstation 4 and the Nintendo Wii U - all of them are completely different!;
, If, for example, you're interested in racing, sports and shooting games, and want a console with HD (high definition) graphics, the PS4 is for you. But, if you'd like to play a wide variety of games for all ages, from shooters for adolescents to games you can play with your gran, the Wii U is more up your street.
 As outlined in the previous step, different games suit different platforms. A good idea is to see if you can play on a particular console to 'get a feel' for the games. Be aware, of course, that not all games are available on all platforms. For example, you will never find a Mario game on a Playstation.
 Websites such as Play, Zavvi, GAME and even Asda have good bundles (addresses for these can be found in the 'Tips' section).
 They're specially trained to answer your questions, and will be able to offer advice on which console best suits your needs, and can tell you about any bundles you might be interested in.

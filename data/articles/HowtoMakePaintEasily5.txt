 If you want the paint to be thick, then use lined paper, and fold it at least two times. If you want it to be thin, use printer paper. The reason lined paper, though it doesn't seem like it, gives thicker paint is that lined paper is softer, and particles in the paper will get in the paint and make it thicker., The newer, the better. Color onto the paper until you are sure it is dark enough., Use the back of a pen, or something like that, to stir it. Stir until the desired color is made.,

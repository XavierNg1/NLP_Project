 Let's say you're working with the following problem:(x + 3)/6 = 2/3

, To cross multiply, simply multiply the denominator of each fraction by the numerator of the other fraction. You'll be essentially multiplying in two diagonal lines. So, multiply the first denominator, 6, by the second numerator, 2, to get 12 on the right side of the equation. Multiply the second denominator, 3, by the first numerator, x + 3, to get 3 x + 9 on the left side of the equation. Here's how it will look:


(x + 3)/6 = 2/3
6 x 2 = 12
(x + 3) x 3 = 3x + 9
3x + 9 = 12

, Combine the constant terms in the equation to subtract 9 from both sides of the equation. Here's what you do:


3x + 9 - 9 = 12 - 9
3x = 3

, Just divide 3x and 9 by 3, the x term coefficient, to solve for x. 3x/3 = x and 3/3 = 1, so you're left with x = 1.
 To check your work, just plug x back in to the original equation to make sure that it works. Here's what you do:


(x + 3)/6 = 2/3
(1 + 3)/6 = 2/3
4/6 = 2/3
2/3 = 2/3

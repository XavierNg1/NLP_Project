 Scientists have known for a very long time that bacteria can acquire resistance to antibiotics and that one of the forces pushing bacteria to acquire this antibiotic resistance was the overuse and misuse of antibiotics.Antibiotics have been and still are used widely in food-producing animals, such as poultry, beef, and pork.


To some degree, resistance to antibiotics is a natural phenomenon. In a population of bacteria, there are always a few that are naturally resistant. These can survive a treatment of antibiotics, especially if a person doesnâ€™t take the antibiotics correctly or for as long as they should have. These surviving bacteria can multiply and grow. Any person infected with these bacteria can then pass it on to others., There are a number of ways that antibiotic-resistant bacteria can become a serious problem.Animals are treated with antibiotics to increase their size or for other reasons, such as illness. Their meat is then contaminated with the antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can then spread to humans.
Animal-based fertilizer containing the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are used on crops. The bacteria survive and are spread through the foods.
Patients and caregivers at healthcare facilities such as nursing homes, hospitals, and other health centers can be particularly susceptible to these infections and to spreading these infections.
 Healthy people do not tend to be at risk for CRE. Those at highest risk for the bacteria are patients already in hospitals and nursing homes who are on ventilators, urinary or intravenous catheters, or who are immune compromised patients.To help minimize your risk, try to promote a healthy lifestyle.

 If no one of age will take you, buy the ticket yourself. Be confident.Remember: all you’re doing is going to see a movie–no big deal. Ask for your ticket the same way you’d order your favorite meal at a restaurant that you go to all the time. Act a little bored by the transaction.Keep in mind that you’re not going to get into any sort of trouble for this; the worst that may happen is no ticket.
 Leave any clothes that make you look young at home. Style your hair and choose clothes that older kids wear.Don’t overreach and try to appear too old, though. Aim to look like you’re exactly the minimum age permitted to see the movie. If it’s for 13 year-olds and up, try to look 13; If it’s for 17 year-olds and up, aim for 17; if it's for 18 year-olds dress like 18.
 If an older sibling has a varsity jacket that fits you well, borrow it. Choose clothes that fit your form instead of clothes that you’re supposed to “grow into.” Wear shoes or sneakers that give you a little extra lift to appear taller. Stuff your bra a little. Apply a touch of makeup, but remember: less is more. Don’t overdo it and appear like you’re trying to look older.
 Do the math beforehand and know your fake birthdate in case anyone asks, so you can answer immediately, without having to think.If you’re going with a group of friends, mimic older kids’ conversations while you’re waiting in line. Talk about subjects relevant to the age you’re pretending to be. For example, if you play baseball or softball, tell a true story about a game you’ve played, but substitute your team with that of the school you’re pretending to attend.

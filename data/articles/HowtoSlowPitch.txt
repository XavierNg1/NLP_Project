 The pitcher's plate is a rectangular piece of white plastic embedded in the ground. It is 50 feet (15.24 m) from home plate, where the batter will hit from. Your foot must stay in contact with the pitcher's plate at all times through a pitch, but you are allowed to move your other leg forward and back as needed to gain momentum for the pitch.;
, You must have the ball and glove touch before each pitch, per basic softball regulations. Usually this happens when you touch the ball into the glove at your waist right before you step into the pitching form.
 Bring your arm back no higher than shoulder height, then swing your arm forward, aiming your hand at home plate. Release the ball when your hand gets even with your thigh. The ball must arc into the air between 6 feet (1.83 m) to 12 feet (3.68 m) otherwise it will be deemed an illegal pitch.
 The goal is to have the softball pass through a space near the batter known as the strike zone. This invisible area coordinates with home plate and extends upward to the space between the batter's knees and shoulders. The ball must pass through the strike zone to be considered a strike in the case that the batter misses hitting the ball.
 The key is not the amount of pitches you know but the accuracy in which you throw them. These pitches include the curve ball and knuckle ball.


Throwing a curve ball is the same technique as throwing a standard slow pitch, but when your hand is moving forward turn your wrist toward you so that when the ball is released it will have a spin to it.
For a knuckle ball, dig 4 fingers into the stitching so your knuckles are sticking up. Throw like a traditional pitch, but do not extend your arm all the way back. Keep your wrist stiff so there is no spin and push off with your fingers when you release it. This is a difficult pitch to master, but if done correctly, it will look faster to the batter and they will swing before the ball actually passes the plate, resulting in a strike.

 It sounds too simple to be true, but it works for a lot of men. Condoms reduce stimulation for most men, which should prolong the time before ejaculation.


Steer clear of condoms that are marketed as extra thin. You can always upgrade to a brand that allows more stimulation later.
Some condoms are coated with a slight numbing gel on the inside. This can help you put off ejaculation for longer without causing numbness to your partner. (Just make sure you know which side is where when you put it on.)

, There are two classes of these products. The first is the traditional "numbing" creams and sprays that have been on the market for some time. The upside is that you'll feel less sensation, which will delay ejaculation. The downside is your partner may suffer a loss of sensation as wellâ€”and of course less sensitive intercourse is not always an appealing notion, even in these circumstances.
 This allows men to have ejaculatory control but with less loss of sexual sensation, and reduces the transference to their partners. Look for products that are compliant to FDA 21CFR 348.10 and have a "eutectic formula" which is the basis of the absorption technology.
 With a little anatomy knowledge, you can delay an oncoming ejaculation by applying pressure to one of two spots.


Perineum pressure: Pressing on the perineum, a spot midway between your scrotum and your anus, will help to stop ejaculation because this spot reaches through to the prostate gland. It is the prostate that contracts and expands during orgasm and then expels the ejaculation fluid. Ask your partner to apply this loving pressure for you.
Testes tug: When a man nears orgasm his scrotum rises up closer to his body. You can delay ejaculation by gently pulling your testes down and away from your body. Your partner can also do this for you.

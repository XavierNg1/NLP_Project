 Bring a few books and your iPod with you on your train journey. Grab a decking of playing cards, as well – there will be plenty of opportunities to mingle with your fellow travelers on the train and a game of cards can help break the ice and get everyone chatting. It’s good to keep busy during a long journey, but don’t forget to look out of your window and watch the scenery go by.


The scenery is one of the perks of train travel! You will no doubt pass through beautiful and interesting landscapes.Don’t forget to bring external chargers for your smartphone, iPod and other gadgets.
 However, the menu will probably be quite limited and not necessarily very healthy, either. Pack some non-perishable snacks like granola bars, crackers, trail mix, peanut butter, dried fruit, nuts and so on. You can keep your energy up, save money and eat more healthily by doing so.


Beverages will be available on the train, but these must be purchased. Keep several bottles of waters with you to keep you hydrated.
 There is typically one bathroom in each train carriage, which everyone on that particular car has to share. Unless you bought a first class ticket, you probably won’t have access to a shower. Because of these reasons, bringing pre-moistened body wipes can make it much easier for you to freshen up during your journey.For ease of use, look for travel wipes that are sold in resealable packages.
Try to buy wipes that are alcohol-free – especially if you have sensitive skin.

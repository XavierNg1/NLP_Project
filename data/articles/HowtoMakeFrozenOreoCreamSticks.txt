 If you're not wanting the brand name, the store's own brand will work just as well as the regular kind. You don't have to stick to the standard Oreos either; you might prefer strawberry flavored Oreos, so choose according to your preference.;
, With more care, remove all of the cream filling out from the Oreos. Place this filling into a bowl and repeat with all remaining cookies.
 Roll the Oreo filling into balls about the size of a nickel (21.2mm). If the filling sticks to your hands too much, just keep dipping your hands in cold water.
 Set aside on wax paper as you make them all or just place on a clean plate as shown in the image; the wax paper just helps prevent stickiness.
, Make the wrapping very taut as the sticks will need the tension to remain upright.
 Place the whole tray into the freezer.
 When they appear set, remove them and pull the toothpicks out of the ice.
 Arrange the Oreo sticks on a serving platter and hand them out to everyone who would like one. Enjoy!

 Wash 2 heads of romaine lettuce and thoroughly dry them. Use a large knife to carefully cut each head of lettuce in half. Place one half of lettuce on each plate. Set aside the lettuce while you prepare the rest of the salad.If you have large heads of lettuce, you may want to cut each half in half so you end up with true wedges.
 Cut 1 1/2 cups (223 g) of cherry tomatoes in half or quarter pieces. Put them in a mixing bowl along with ⅔ cup (100 g) of chopped cucumber with the seeds removed and ⅔ cup (150 g) of chopped celery (from about 2 ribs). Add ¼ cup (33 g) of pitted and halved Kalamata olives and 1 very thinly sliced shallot. Stir all of the vegetables with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Set the mixture aside., Whisk together ¼ cup (60 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil, 2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of tahini, and 2 to 3 cloves of pressed or minced garlic in a small prep bowl. Keep whisking until the dressing is combined and smooth.Taste the dressing and add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt (or more) and pepper to taste.
 Scoop a few large spoonfuls of the seasoned vegetable mixture over each wedge or half of romaine lettuce on the serving plates. Drizzle the lemon tahini dressing over each salad so the dressing coats the lettuce. Garnish the salads with ¼ cup (37 g) of crumbled feta cheese and ¼ cup (5 g) of finely chopped fresh mint or basil.Offer your guests steak knives which can help cut the lettuce wedges.

 If you are taking inspiration from a film like Dracula, you should work on your soul-piercing gaze. Try to look right through people. To achieve this effect, you should practice an unblinking gaze which you can hold for what is seemingly longer than humanly possible.Don't be surprised if people consider you to be "off with the fairies" rather than perceptive; it's a hard look to pull off, as sometimes you can look dazed rather than intent.
 If someone opens the curtains or you're forced to walk outside during the day, you should hiss and draw your cloak protectively over your face. You should also claim to be highly photo-sensitive and prone to sunburn.


Vampires can never feel fully at ease during the day. Once night falls, however, you can relax and be your normal fearless self again. You are master (or mistress) of the night.
 Vampires are not known for their bubbly, fun personalities. They are serious and contemplative, without time or patience for frivolity. As seen in the movies, a vampire should be withdrawn, sullen, demure and silent.Vampires don't giggle either. If you must laugh, aim for a dark chuckle or grunt of amusement.

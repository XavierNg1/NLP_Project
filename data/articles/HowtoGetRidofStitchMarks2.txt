 Talk to your doctor about removing the external stitches before they leave track marks, which are the small bumps that appear on either side of the incision. If possible, have your doctor remove the external stitches after one week to prevent any permanent scarring.
 For a more serious professional option, consider using targeted laser treatment to remove the stitch marks or stitch scarring. Using laser treatment on fresh scars, within six to eight weeks of the injury, can lead to a more effective treatment and removal of the scar. There are two types of laser treatments:Pulsed dye lasers: This is a non-ablative laser treatment that uses an intense, targeted burst of light. The heat is then absorbed by the blood vessels in your skin and can help to improve the texture and thickness of scars. It can also reduce any redness around the scar.
Fractional ablative lasers: This treatment pokes small holes into the scar. This stimulates collagen production and can remodel the scar to appear less noticeable. This type of laser treatment is recommended for shallow scars.
Most laser treatments will require multiple treatment sessions and can cost between $300 to $600 per a session.
 If you experience any of these symptoms, as well as fever and increased pain around the stitch marks, you should go see your doctor. The stitch marks may be infected or you may have had an allergic reaction to the antibacterial cream.Your doctor will need to examine and treat the stitch marks to prevent further infection or complications.

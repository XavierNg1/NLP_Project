 If you are unsure whether or not your vehicle has a cloth or vinyl top, an easy way to be sure is to refer to the vehicle’s owner’s manual. The owner’s manual should indicate what type of material the top is made of, as well as recommended actions you can take to prolong the life of your convertible top.If you do not have the owner’s manual, try referring to the auto maker’s website.
 Vinyl tops have more of a plastic seeming finish to them than cloth tops do, so they react differently to things like lint. Whereas lint and fuzz will blow right off of a vinyl convertible top, it will often stick directly to a cloth top. If you see lint stuck to your top, it is likely made of cloth.If you do not see any lint or fuzz on the top, try rubbing a small piece of drier lint on the convertible top. If it does not stick, it is likely vinyl.
 Another easy way to assess whether or not your convertible top is made of cloth or vinyl is to pour a small amount of water onto the top and then rubbing it around with your fingers. Bring a cup of water and a spoon out to your vehicle. Use the spoon to apply a small amount of water to the convertible top, then press you index and middle fingers into the water and rub it around.You will need less than a spoonful of water to successfully test the material of the top.
You can pour the water directly from the cup, but be careful not to pour too much or it will saturate the top and make it harder to determine its material.
 After you pour the water on the top and rub it around with your fingers observe where the water goes. If it remains at the surface and swishes around as you rub it, the top is likely made of vinyl. If the water absorbs into the material of the top, it is made of cloth.Pouring too much water on the top will result in the water swishing around at the surface regardless of the material.
This test can be conducted anywhere on the convertible top.

 Farmers markets have local produce at a decent price. This means you get it fresher and cheaper than at the grocery store. Also, many times there are surpluses of certain crops and these can be purchased way under retail cost. If you go towards the end of the day, many vendors drop the prices to deplete their inventory for the day. Before going to the market, do some research on what the shelf life is of certain fruits and vegetables and if they will freeze well. This way you can purchase the right amount. A local farm is another option because they usually sell at a reasonable rate since they are cutting back transportation and storage costs.
 Produce that is in season costs less because it did not have to be shipped from a place that it will grow year-round. If you buy extra, you may be able to freeze it for later months.
 Many fruits and vegetables can be grown in pots or in the ground. They can also be grown indoors or outside. Garden, when done right, can produce an abundance of produce that can be eaten fresh, canned or frozen. If you live in a community with little land, you may be able to start a community garden so the neighborhood can share in the benefits. This is especially helpful if you live in a neighborhood that has little access to a well stocked grocery store.
 Many times grocery stores have more of one item in stock and they need it too sell quickly before it spoils. They will usually advertise the sales in a weekly circular. This is good for stocking up on that item.

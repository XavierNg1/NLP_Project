 Suede is a very delicate material, so you can’t use just any brush. You also can’t use water to clean most stains. You must use a soft brush to gently rub away the dirt. You can buy a suede brush, which can be found at most major retailers, shoe shops, or online.If you don’t have a suede brush, try a soft nylon brush. A brush used for nails could work. A soft cloth can also work if you don’t have a brush.
Just make sure the brush is not too hard.;
, To start cleaning, use the brush to brush away any dirt and stains. This gets all the dirt from the surface of the shoe. When first brushing, make sure you brush in the same direction. This helps remove anything on the surface.This works for mud and other basic stains.
 After you’ve brushed all the dirt off the surface, use the brush to rub with slightly more pressure. Brush back and forth over the stain to try to remove the dirt that is deeper in the suede.Make sure to still only use moderate pressure. Suede is delicate, so if you brush it too hard, you can damage it.
 After you have cleaned your shoes, consider spraying them with black suede protector. This product will help keep your shoes from getting too many surface stains, though it won’t protect from everything.Black suede protector has dye in it to help maintain the black color of your shoes. You can also buy plain spray suede protector if you don't want to use a dye one.
 Cleaning your black suede shoes may lighten the black color. If this happens, you can buy black suede dye. Follow the directions on the suede dye package to properly dye your shoes. Cover the area with the dye and allow to set.Make sure to buy dye specifically for suede.

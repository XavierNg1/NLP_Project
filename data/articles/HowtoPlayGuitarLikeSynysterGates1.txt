 The first guitar you should look at is the Schecter Synyster Custom , it is Synyster Gates signature guitar. And going through the list there is also the Schecter Hellraiser C-1 FR, Gibson Custom Shop Les Paul Custom, The Parker Fly, and various other guitars for a Syn kind of feel.A Schecter Blackjack C-1 is also one of Synyster's main guitars.;
, So Synyster used to use the Marshall JCM800s as of late, but in the past he has also used; Bogner Uberschall and Caveman amps and the Krank Revolution Head. However more recently, he has begun using his own custom make of amp, the Schecter Hellwin which he custom designed.

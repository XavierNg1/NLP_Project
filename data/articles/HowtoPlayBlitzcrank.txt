Grab Blitzcrank's W at level 2. It is an attack speed and movement speed buff. Then at level 3, grab E. It is a punch that knocks the enemy into the air and stuns them. Retreat back to spawn.
 If you have trouble getting gold, Aegis of the Legion. It is a cheap substitute for Guardian Angel.

 Blitzcrank's ultimate is a shock field that strikes every 2.5 seconds. When active, is hits everything is a region around Blitzcrank, silencing them.
 If you have left over gold, begin building toward mercury boots.
 At level seven, get W, and at level eight, get Q.
 Blitzcrank has a high defense coupled with his mana shield. To start a fight, go to mid and signal the jungler to do the same. Then jump out of jungle and grab the enemy. You will almost always be hit by the rest of the enemy team. Use the ultimate and begin running. Your health will begin to deteriorate rapidly. At 20%, your mana shield will pop up. Right before your mana shield activates, use your Manamune. This particular item will boost your mana to almost full. Continue running while your team takes care of the enemy.
,, Now, when you pull someone, don't worry about killing them. Leave them there and attack the turret.
 If you see the enemy jungler stealing your dragon, grab the dragon and beat it up. Then, grab the enemy and beat them up!

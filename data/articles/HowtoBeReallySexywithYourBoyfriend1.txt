 While being sexy can help add spice to your relationship, it's important to know when you've had enough. Here are some signs that you should cut back:


If you're feeling sad or depressed. There will be days when you ask your boyfriend for a hankie instead of some hanky-panky. If you're feeling so upset that you can barely function, know that it's okay to put sexy time on hold. If your boyfriend knows and loves you, he'll understand.
If you're just not in the mood. There will be days when nothing you do will make you have that lovin' feeling, and that's okay too. Forced sexiness is worse than taking a time out for "me time" instead of "sexy time."
If his actions make you feel uncomfortable. If you think he's taking your romance too far, it's time to back off. If you notice that you're feeling uncomfortable a lot, then it may be time to end the relationship.;
, Though it may seem impossible that there will be a time when your boyfriend isn't in the mood, accept that he's human and may not be feeling so sexy. Here are some signs that he may not be in the mood for your sexy moves:


If he's tired or sick. If he looks physically unable to have sexy time, chances are, he doesn't want it. If he'd rather hit the hay instead of have a roll in the hay, don't force him to do anything he doesn't want. He may feel guilty for not being up for your advances, which will only make everyone feel worse.
If he's stressed out. Though sex can be a stress reliever, if your man is so worried about his new job that he can't focus on you, give him some alone time.

 It's important to use a big pot, since you don't want the broccoli to remain in the water for too long. A smaller pot will cool down quickly once the frozen broccoli is added and take longer to cook.
 It may or may not have frozen into one large clump; either way is fine.
 Remove after one minute to ninety seconds - that's all the time it takes to reconstitute frozen broccoli.

Cooking broccoli longer than a minute and a half will cause it to get soggy and fall apart.






Make sure you don't add the broccoli to the water until it is at a full boil.
 Place the broccoli in a bowl and season with butter, salt, pepper and cheese if desired.

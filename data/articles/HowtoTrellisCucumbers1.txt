 The poles should both be 4 feet (1.2 meters) long with a square 1-inch by 1-inch (2.5 by 2.5 centimeters) face.;
, The hole should be centered and positioned 2 inches (5 centimeters) down from the top of each piece.
 The holes should overlap so that you can see straight through to the ground if you look through them.
 The bolt should hold the two poles together, temporarily acting as a hinge.
 Keep the poles lying flat on the ground.
 The two poles should now be fixed in place, forming the first "A" set of legs for your frame.
 These other two poles should form another "A" set of legs.
 The "A" shape should not be flat or parallel to the ground. Instead, the "A" should be perpendicular to the ground, with one leg flat on the ground while the other points up and out.
 This fifth pole should connect the legs together. Use a power drill and heavy-duty screws to hold them together.
 The lower legs are the legs currently resting on the ground. Use a power drill and heavy-duty screws to hold them together. This creates a top bar to fix your netting to.
 Use a power drill and heavy-duty screws to hold them together. This creates a lower bar to fix your netting to.
 The upper legs are those currently off the ground. Use a power drill and heavy-duty screws to fix the netting bars onto the legs.

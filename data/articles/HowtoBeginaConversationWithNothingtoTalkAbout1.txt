 This can be anything. An index card, a notebook paper, or a sticky note. It doesn't matter.;
, It can be anything from "how are you/what have you been doing?" or "have you seen any good movies lately?" Try to keep the question open ended. Depending on how much time you have, to be friendly just ask how they are. It's not much but it's still a good start.
, But try to ask different ones also.
 Have you seen the movie? They don't need to ask, just say if you have seen it. Did you like the movie? Why/why not?

,, Make this list different, make it things about them. Is there something they like to do? Ask them how it's going, ask how/where they do that. Is there something you have in common with them? Talk about that.

 You should have an idea where you plan to hang your artwork before selecting the wood plank in order to give you an idea of size. A lumberyard may have an area of used pieces of wood or you could use a plank of wood from an old piece of furniture (that you were going to discard) or from a home remodel.


Sand the reclaimed wood to remove splinters, old paint or loose wood. Make several passes with the sander until the plank is clean and ready for staining.
Apply stain or paint. Allow ample dry time before proceeding to the next coat or step.;
, The spoons will be mounted on the wood and will act as the holder for your votive candles.

Lay the spoon on a flat surface, holding the spoon mouth firmly with one hand.






Grasp the spoon handle and bend it upward until the spoon becomes an “L” shape.






Lay spoon on a flat surface with the handle portion laying on the surface. You will want to make sure the handle rests evenly against the surface (and ultimately the piece of wood).
 Before you make it permanent, lay out the spoons on the wood so you can see how it will look once secured. Keep in mind that each spoon mouth will hold a candle, which may help with placement.


Hold spoon handle against the wood and nail against the plank using the nail gun. You may need to add a few nails in order to make sure the spoon is completely secured (consider one at the top and base of the handle).
 For best results, purchase a picture frame mounting kit at your local craft store. The kit should come with everything you need to hang the wood securely to the wall. Look for a kit that is designed for heavier wall art.


Place candles on spoons and light.

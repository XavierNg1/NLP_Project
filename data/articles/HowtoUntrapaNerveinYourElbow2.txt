 Try over-the-counter NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen to alleviate pain and inflammation. This can help reduce pressure around the nerve, letting it move more freely and painlessly. Ask your doctor or pharmacist which medication is right for you if you have any medical conditions, especially if you have liver or kidney problems.

Corticosteroid injections are sometimes used to reduce swelling and pressure.Some doctor prefer not to use these, however, because of the risk of damaging the nerve. Ask your doctor.
 Wrap ice or an ice pack in a towel and place it on your elbow where it’s tender. Keep this on for 20 minutes, several times per day. This can help relieve inflammation and pain., Talk to your doctor or a physical therapist about whether an assistive device like a brace or a splint is right for you. This can help you keep your arm straight while you’re being active, which will let the nerve rest and recover. Wear your brace or splint as often and as long as your doctor tells you.You might wear your splint only at night, only when you’re active, or during the day and night., Hold your arm out in front of you with your elbow straight. Curl your fingers and wrist inward toward your body. Then extend them away from you, and extend your wrist so that your fingers point towards the floor. Then bend your elbow.Some doctors think this exercise may help your nerve slide over your elbow more easily and alleviate symptoms.

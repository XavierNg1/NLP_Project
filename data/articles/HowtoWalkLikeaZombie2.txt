 Keep in mind that your gums and tongue should have decayed as much as the rest of your body. Unless you’re going to dye the inside of your mouth black, hide that pretty pink flesh from view.Keep your jaw relaxed and loose for a more vacant expression, but be careful not to part your lips too wide., Keep the muscles in your face relaxed, especially those in your eyes, cheeks, and brow. Use your peripheral vision to look where you’re going. Avoid focusing straight ahead, which may cause you to squint and/or crease your brow without you realizing it.


To give those humans an extra scare, keep your stare blank and your vision peripheral until you finally “notice” them. Then zero straight in on them with single-minded intent.
Resist blinking. Remember, your brain and body aren’t working right. Minimize involuntary actions like blinking to indicate damage. Disconcert those pesky humans with long, unblinking stares., Hold your head any which way but straight and forward. Indicate that the wiring between your brain and body are too impaired to hold your head normally. Let it roll around with every step, as if you’re unable to hold it in place at all, or imagine that your neck is broken and hold your head at an unnaturally stiff angle.


For scary contrast, suddenly straighten your head the instant when some yummy brains catch your eye.

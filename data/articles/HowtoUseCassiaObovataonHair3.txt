 This is where you will make your fully customized Cassia obovata mix.
 Research the pros and cons of each liquid before mixing and decide which one will provide your desired effect. You can use anything from Chamomile tea to hot water or even champagne! If you're short on time, try chamomile tea for a fast dye release. If you have a lot of time, try lemon juice for a rich stain. The liquid does not have to be acidic, but most people find acidic mixes stain better.
 While this step is optional, it's fun and potentially rewarding to experiment with different herbs for scent, tone and conditioning that suits your own hair type. Some suggestions include:


Unbleached chamomile leaves can be a great blonde booster.
Cinnamon can add warm red or auburn tones.
Powdered cloves can mask the cassia scent.
Rhubarb root, like cassia, contains a large amount of Chrysophanic acid, which makes it stain yellow so it's great to enhance the blonde. This will also stain your hands or clothes, so take care!

 If you don't know how to get a command block, all you need to do is type: "/give (Player) minecraft:command_block". You cannot find this block in the creative inventory.;
, It gives you the syntax of the command. But as explained, it is meant to be used in a command block. If this is in a Adventure Map, you don't know who you will be testing for. So where you type player, you can use some fillers. These include: @p(Targets the nearest player), @a(Targets all players), @r(Targets random player), or @e(This targets all entities. This was added in the 1.8 update.)


The last part of the syntax is a data tag. This will be covered later.
 This is to see if a player is online. However, it is easier to just press your tab button on your keyboard (in Multiplayer). However, you can have a comparator take an output from a command block, just like it can take from a chest. To do this, place a comparator with the input against the command block. It the command succeeds (finds the player), it will give a redstone signal.
 One of the easiest is /tell, having it tell you something. You can you use /tellraw for a more aesthetic look, but this requires a JSON text, and that is a completely different subject, one that requires it's own tutorial. The first command block tests for a player, and the second one tells you that this player is online.
 We will cover and explain two types, but the rest you will have to do some research to learn. In the command syntax, you would type: "/testfor (Player) (Data Tag)". Data tags are written in brackets({}). One Data Tag is the Selected Slot tag. To use this, type: "/testfor (Player) {SelectedSlot:(Slot #)}" The slots are listed starting at 0, so your first hotbar slot is actually slot 0. Your second hotbar slot is slot 1, and so on.
 The syntax for this one is tricky. Type "/testfor (Player) {Inventory:}" This only works for hotbar slots.
 For example, type: "/testfor (Player) {SelectedItemSlot:0,Inventory:}".

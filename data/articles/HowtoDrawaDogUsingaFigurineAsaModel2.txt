 Any size is fine, but if your are thinking of putting the dog in an outdoor setting, allow a large, 11” x 14” piece of paper. The same goes for an indoor setting. How large do you want to make the dog, if it is going to be a portrait and how much of the environment do you want to include in your painting? It is up to you, but it‘s best to allow a lot of space on your paper because having the room to expand is better than wishing you‘d allowed more paper at the start., Put everything on a solid work table and prepare your colors, either by activating each dry pad of color with a brushfull of water or squeezing pigments onto a palette. Drop a small amount of water on freshly squeezed paint, too., Tackling the most difficult thing immediately is a good strategy, if only to know that a major hurdle has been crossed. Since the dog is your subject and most likely the focus of the painting, take your time and get it right. Keep in mind you will be coloring the scene shortly and drawn guide lines are helpful., Working from a statue gives you the information you need in three dimensions. Study the shapes, planes and detailed areas of the dog as carefully as you study the outline which defines his breed., Look with an eye to planning how you will depict the fur, describing it to yourself; rough, smooth, shaggy, feathered, etc. Do the same with color and distribution of spots and the like., Even if it is just cushions or drapes in the case of a portrait, indicate what will go where.

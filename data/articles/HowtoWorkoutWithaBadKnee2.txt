 It's true that walking involves movement in the knees, but it is a safe exercise for those with knee problems. Walking is a low-impact activity, which means your knees won't experience as much stress as they would if you were, for example, running. If you have access to a gym, consider running on an elliptical machine because it allows you to go through the motions of running without the hard impact of hitting the ground with your feet.
 Many people believe that jogging will inevitably lead to arthritis, but that isn't completely true. If you have a history of injury to your knees, then jogging should likely be avoided because knee injuries are a risk factor towards long-term knee arthritis. However, if your knees haven't experienced many injuries, then light or medium jogging can be great.
 Because of the buoyancy of water, swimming is a great way to involve your whole body in exercise while taking the stress of body weight off of your knees. Swimming hard and fast is an excellent way to maintain cardiovascular health. Just be sure to avoid movements that involve your knees, such as the breaststroke.
 Like running an elliptical machine, bicycle riding is a low-impact activity that takes some undue stress off of the knees. However, when riding a bicycle, do not ride up steep hills and do not set the incline to be too high on an indoor cycle. While riding a bicycle is low-impact, too much resistance may cause too much pressure for your knees to handle.
 Any exercise that locks your knees into a single position can be good. For hips, lie down on your back and perform straight-leg raises. For abs, most variations of the crunch should be fine. For calves, perform calf raises. For the upper body, perform pushups, pull-ups, and dips.

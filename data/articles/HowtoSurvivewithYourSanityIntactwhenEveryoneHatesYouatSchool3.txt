 When you walk away from a bully, you show that that person doesn’t have control over your actions or emotions.Engaging the person means you are meeting him or her on the same level. You don’t need to engage this person, and there’s no use putting any of your energy into the situation.


Remember that you choose your response. Is it worth engaging with this person? It may be better to just walk away and not even bother.
 If someone is harassing you or egging you on, calmly tell this person that you are not interested in engaging with him or her.Remember the person can only bully you if you give him or her power over your emotions. Once you no longer seem to care what this person thinks, he or she may become bored or disinterested.


If the person persists, ignore the person.
Say, “I don’t want to talk to you” or “This doesn’t interest me.” Remember that you have control over how (or if) you react. If it isn’t worth your time, say so.
 Ask yourself, “Will I remember this situation in 1 year? What about 5 years? Will this affect my life then?” If not, determine to spend your energy and time elsewhere.Also ask yourself if these are people that will continue to be in your life for a long time. If you have plans to go to college or move, it’s likely these people will be gone from your life soon enough.
 If someone is being mean to you, respond with a joke or with some humor.Humor completely disarms someone trying to hurt you, and he or she may be too surprised to know how to respond. When you use humor, it shows that this person has no control over you.


If a mean person targets you and you respond with a joke, it’s likely he or she will lose interest in trying to hurt you.
If someone is making fun of your shoe size, say, “You’re probably right. I tried out for the Lord of the Rings but I guess my feet weren’t hairy enough.”

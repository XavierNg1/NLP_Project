 You file a “complaint” to start a lawsuit. In this document, you should have identified yourself and the person you are suing (the “defendant”). You should also have described the factual circumstances of your dispute.Before drafting the affidavit, reread your entire complaint and make sure the information is accurate.
 You can type up the affidavit on a separate sheet of paper. Open a blank word processing document and insert the caption information at the top of the page. You can get the caption information by looking at your complaint. It includes:the name of the court
your name (as the “plaintiff”)
the defendant’s name
the case number

, You can title the document “Plaintiff’s Affidavit.” Insert the title directly under the caption and center it between the left- and right-hand margins. You can make the title all caps, bolded, and underlined for emphasis., The purpose of the affidavit is to swear to the truth of the information in your complaint. You will also attest that you are signing under penalty of perjury.


For example, you could write: “I, Michael Young, am the Plaintiff in this action, and I do hereby swear and/or affirm that all of the foregoing statements are true and correct. I fully understand that I execute this affidavit under penalty of perjury.”There may be other information that you need to include. You can check with your court clerk or read your court’s Rules of Civil Procedure, which may tell you what needs to be included in the affidavit.
 You may need to sign in front of a notary public.There should be a notary in the courthouse or in your town manager’s office. Also, most large banks have notaries. You will need to show the notary acceptable forms of personal identification, such as a state-issued ID or a passport.

 The hundred is one of the core Pilates exercises. As you pump your arms, imagine yourself pushing down a pile of sand with your hands. You will do 5 inhalations and 5 exhalations per set for 10 sets, which is why the exercise is called the hundred.
 This exercise is more for the intermediate or advanced Pilates student. If you are not able to complete the rocking motion, then simply work on balancing yourself on your seat in the “V” position without rocking back and forth. When your core becomes stronger, then you can add the rocking motion to the exercise.
 Cris crosses are similar to side-to-side crunches except that your legs move into your body as you cross your upper body over. During this exercise, make sure to keep plenty of space between your shoulders and your ears. Do not scrunch your neck into your shoulders or lift your back up off of the floor. If needed, practice the movements without your legs elevated until you are strong enough to perform the exercise with the leg movement.
 As you roll up and down on your mat while doing this exercise, try to think of yourself raising and lowering one vertebra at a time. Switch crossed legs every other repetition to work both sides of your core equally. Again, some practice holding yourself in a “V” position might be necessary before fully engaging with this exercise.
 If lifting your leg to a 90-degree angle is challenging at first, then start by lifting your leg to hip height and holding it in position before lowering it. Gradually increase the height of the lift as you grow more accustomed to the exercise. Imagine that a spring connects your ankle to the ceiling and that, as you raise and lower your leg, you are applying resistance against the spring. This will make your movement more fluid.

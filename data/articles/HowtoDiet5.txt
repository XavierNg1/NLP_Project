 Some diets are meant to be life-long and others are simply short-term to achieve a weight loss goal. Many diets are fine temporarily but may not be healthy over the long run.


Be careful of "yo-yo" dieting. "Yo-yo" dieting, also known as weight cycling, is the phenomenon by which you lose weight on a diet, regain it after the diet ends and embark on a new diet. Repeated "yo-yo" dieting can increase the risk for mental distress, life dissatisfaction and binge eating; over time it can damage the cells that line the blood vessels increasing your risk for heart disease. , Ending a diet can be a relief, but if you simply return to your old ways of eating, you can easily gain back the weight you worked so hard to lose. Instead, think about putting a maintenance plan in place to keep you at your new weight.


If you've been on a liquid diet or one that seriously restricted caloric intake, you must be careful and add foods back slowly so as not to shock your system. Incorporate homemade soups, fruits and vegetables over a period of a few days before settling into a healthy eating routine.

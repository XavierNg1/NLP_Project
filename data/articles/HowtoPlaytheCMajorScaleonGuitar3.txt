 If you already know a few chords on guitar, it may be easier for you to learn scales by pattern than by note or interval. When you play a chord on guitar, you're playing every other note of the scale starting with the root note, which gives the chord its name.








When you find chords within scales, you can blend the two together to improvise sequences on your guitar.
If you know the root note of a chord, you can figure out the scale for that note from the chord alone, especially if you've already learned the interval formula.
 You can find pattern diagrams online or in books on how to play guitar. By memorizing these diagrams, or finger shapes, you can easily play a number of different scales and chords up and down the neck of your guitar.Pattern diagrams may be the easiest way for you to learn if you are a visual learner. Finding patterns also can be more fun than memorizing notes or following an interval formula.
The pattern diagrams show you where to place your fingers when you're playing a chord. Typically the root note is a black dot and the other notes are blank dots. You also might see finger numbers or notes. Use the type that's easiest for you to understand.
 Once you've become familiar with the single-octave patterns for the C Major scale, you can create larger patterns that cover the whole fretboard and encompass multiple octaves.








Remember that notes repeat as you move up the fretboard. If you fret a string at the first fret, you'll find the same note by fretting that string at the thirteenth fret â€“ just in a different octave.
Single-octave patterns repeat up and down the fretboard, so once you've learned it in one position, move down to the next root note and play it again in a different octave.

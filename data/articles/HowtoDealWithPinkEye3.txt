 Pink eye is often accompanied by drainage, which can build up and cause your eyes to crust over. It is important to keep your affected eye(s) as clean as possible. Use a wet washcloth to wipe away any drainage from your eye(s). You can also use tissues or paper towels.


Use a fresh tissue or clean part of the washcloth each time you wipe your eye.
Make sure that you wipe from your inner eye (near your nose) towards your outer eye.
Dispose of tissues right after you use them and put washcloths into the dirty laundry right away.
 You can soothe some of the discomfort associated with an infection by applying cool sterilized compresses to your closed eyes.Avoid using warm compresses because they can increase the spread of infection. Also, make sure that you use a separate compress for each eye and that you use a clean towel every time you use a compress.To make a compress:


Put some ice in a clean, plastic bag and seal.
Wrap the bag with tinfoil. This is needed to prevent the ice melting quickly from your body heat.
Wrap once more with a paper towel or a towel to secure contents. This also allows compress to be less messy and more comfortable.
Gently put your compress on one eye. Leave it there for 5 minutes.
Repeat process with the other eye for 5 minutes.
 Artificial drops can help ease your symptoms by reducing the gritty sensation that sometimes accompanies pink eye. If you are already using prescription eye drops, make sure to ask your doctor about using lubricating drops in addition to prescription eye drops.Your best bet for eye drops that will not interact negatively with prescribed medications is plain sterile saline solution. Your pharmacist can help you find it.

 Make one 1 x 1 1/2" (2.5cm x 3.81cm) square, one 1 x 1 1/4" (2.5cm x 3.17cm) square, and one 1 x 1" (2.5cm x 2.5cm) square. The glass needs to be very clean; even if it looks clean, oils from your fingers or cutting oil can ruin your beautiful project!;
, This will allow the glass to move more or less evenly as it spreads to its natural thickness of about 1/4" (0.635cm). The glass is now ready to be fused.
, Hold for 5 minutes, then bring up to about 1000°F (538ºC).


Hold, with the kiln vented, to allow the burnt binder fumes from the shelf paper to escape.
 As this is a small stacked piece, it can be fused fairly quickly.
 When fully fused, the glass should be nicely rounded with no sharp edges and with a smooth top surface.
 Close the kiln and allow it to cool to room temperature. Be careful of the hot air escaping from the kiln when it is opened. Wear heatproof gloves and dark kiln safety glasses.

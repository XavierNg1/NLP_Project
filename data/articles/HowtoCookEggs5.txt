 Set the frying pan on the stove over medium to medium-high heat and wait several minutes for it to get hot.


Ideally, the pan should be hot enough so that a drop of water immediately sizzles away into steam if dropped inside.
 Gently tap the shell on the side of your pan or on the countertop. Break the egg open and let it drop directly into the pan.


Cook one egg at a time to prevent the whites from running together.






Drop the eggs carefully so that the yolks do not break.
 This should take about 3 minutes.You should not flip, turn, or otherwise move the egg during the cooking process.






The yolks should be left in liquid form.
 Use a spatula to gently lift the egg out of the frying pan and onto your serving plate. Work carefully to prevent the yolk from bursting open.

 For iced coffee the size always goes one cup up. For example, if the customer orders a small iced coffee, give them a medium cup. If medium, large cup. If large, extra large cup., So you don't get mixed up later on mark the cup either with a marker or the sticker that should print out. Note any special changes during this time., Using the scoop, fill the cup with ice until the fill line., Using the machine or individual cups fill the coffee with the needed amount of cream.

Small=3 creams
Medium=4 creams.
large=5 creams.
 Using the pumps fill the coffee with the needed amount of sugar. Make sure to pump all the way down for each. Note that for plain coffee you will use the liquid sugar, for flavored you will use the flavor pumps and nothing else. The flavors are the sugar.

Small=3 sugar shots.
Medium=4 sugar shots.
Large=6 sugar shots.
 Using a spoon stir the drink 12 times from bottom to top. Ensure to scrape the bottom with each time so you really mix the drink., Place the necessary cap on the drink and put it where it needs to go drive thru or counter.

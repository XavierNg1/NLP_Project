 You'll have to have this step down to learn running shuffles.
 Lean forward slightly and run with your weight on the balls of your feet.
 Keep running, but every when you step on your right foot, shuffle with the left. Try switching this around when you get the hang of it. Just run with shuffles to one direction.
 Once you get the hang of that, shuffle in both directions. When you step on your left foot, shuffle your right foot, and when you step on your right foot, shuffle on your left foot. Running shuffles are just basic runs in place with shuffles thrown in - after some practice, you'll have the technique easily.

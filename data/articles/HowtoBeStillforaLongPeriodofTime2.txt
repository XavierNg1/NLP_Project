 Once you’re in a comfortable and relaxed position, and you’ve postured your body for stillness, you will need to clear your thoughts and let go of all the mental chatter. It never fails; once you sit still, the activity in your mind tends to increase. Therefore, you will need to rein in the distractive thoughts that start to flood your mind.You can start with a statement like “I'm not worried about anything right now. I just want to have a moment without unnecessary thoughts." But you may need to repeat that statement a few times while taking deep breaths.Whenever your mind starts to wander, try mentally counting down.
 Being mindful of how you’re breathing helps you to relax and be still. Also, paying attention to how you breathe helps you to gradually begin to concentrate.


Listen to your breath.
Inhale and exhale naturally.
Don’t try to manipulate your breathing pattern.
Allow yourself to feel the air moving in and out of your nose.
 Avoid worrying about everything that you have to do that day or the next day. And don’t allow your mind to drift off into memories of the past or thoughts about the future. Be present in the moment. By practicing the awareness of your stillness, it can help you to remain still.
If you hear a distracting sound, just try to quickly refocus on your breathing.
When a physical sensation comes, such as an itch, try to avoid responding to it while you are being still.
 Having an object to concentrate on can keep your mind from wandering. For example, a waterfall, a beach, or a tree, and try to only focus on it. The goal is to let your mind achieve relaxed awareness.Having a picture of a tranquil setting may be helpful.
Allowing your senses to come into your visualization experience works as well.

 If your hair is naturally very light blonde, you may be able to get by without bleaching. For the most part, however, bleached hair is necessary to have an unconventional color, like red or pink, show up in your hair.The vast majority of unconventional hair colors are semi-permanent. This means they will not lift the color in your natural hair. You have to change the color yourself via bleaching.
For bleaching, it's a good idea to go to a salon. This is especially important if you want to dye your whole hair an unconventional color. Bleaching can damage your hair, so it's a good call to have professional assessment prior to bleaching.
However, you may be able to bleach at home using a kit if you're only doing strands of color. Be careful to follow all instructions carefully when applying color to your hair.
 Not all hair colors are appropriate for work and school. Hair colors will last awhile, so think carefully about whether your color is appropriate for all situations.


Colors that are found in natural hair, like reds and blondes, are generally appropriate for most situations. If you intend to dye your hair in a natural shade, you probably do not have to worry about your professional appearance.
However, a more dramatic color, like hot pink, may not be appropriate everywhere. With certain creative jobs, an unconventional hair color may not be a concern. However, if you work in a highly professional setting, you may want to avoid dramatic shades.
 If you believe you need a professional stylist, understand this will not be cheap. Professional hair dyeing may cost over $100. Spend some time considering whether you have the money to dye your hair professionally.


If you're unsure if you can afford a professional dye job right now, you can try to put some money aside. You can also look into dyeing your hair a color that will take more easily to your natural shade. These colors will be easier to dye on your own.

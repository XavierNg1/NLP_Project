 Pinterest will now return a list of pins that match your search, however, these pins are general results from all across Pinterest. You’ll still need to narrow down the results to find your own pins.
 It’s one of the four buttons right above the list of pins. Now you’ll see your own pins that match what you’ve search for.


If your search doesn’t turn up any results, it may be because your search was too specific. Try searching for something more general.

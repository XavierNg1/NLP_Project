The strength you use is determined by the texture of your hair. For instance, if you have coarse hair you would use a "super" strength hair relaxer.;

Since a hair relaxer is made up of chemicals, it is important to protect clothing in case the chemicals splash. Use a hair dresser's cape or towel wrapped around your shoulders.



Work with dry hair and divide the hair into 4 quadrants: front left, front right, back left, back right.

Typically, hair relaxer comes as a cream or paste and there will be chemicals that will be mixed together to complete the relaxer chemical process. This achieves the desired straightened effect.



You will need to use a color brush or a 1-inch (2.5 cm) paint brush to apply the relaxer to the sections. Saturate the hair with the relaxer. Apply the relaxer to all 4 sections until the hair is completely coated.



Begin at the section you started with when applying the relaxer. Divide the hair, again, into small sections. An eighth of an inch (3 mm) is fine. Using your fingers, begin to pull the hair to stretch out the curl. You can use the back of a comb for this as well, just run the flat spine of the comb along the hair. Repeat this in all 4 quadrants and twice to each quadrant.

Hot water opens the hair cuticle, which allows you to rinse the relaxer thoroughly from the hair. Rinse for at least 5 minutes depending on the length of the hair.



The manufacturer's directions may indicate that you shampoo immediately after rinsing out the relaxer. Each hair relaxer manufacturer has different processes when it comes to this step.



Hair relaxer chemicals are harsh so they can alter the structure of the hair. Damage to the hair is to be expected.

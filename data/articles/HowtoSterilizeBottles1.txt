 Before starting any type of sterilization method, make sure your hands are clean. Use warm, soapy water and rinse them well.
 Use warm, soapy water to wash the insides and outsides of the bottles. Make sure to scrub around grooves in the neck of the bottle and remove all traces of food, then rinse the bottles well.









If you plan to sterilize the bottle lids or nipples, wash them thoroughly as well.
If you're working with bottles that have caked-on substances inside, soak them in a mild bleach solution (a capful of bleach for each gallon of water) to loosen the substance, then wash with soapy water and rinse.

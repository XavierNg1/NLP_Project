 Make use of all four of your limbs with your body upright (vertical). If you turn your body horizontal and start kicking with your legs and paddling with your feet, you'll start swimming, not treading water.;
, Keep your head above water and try to slowly regulate your breathing. Slowing down your breath will help you calm down, conserve energy, and tread water longer.
 If you move them up and down, you'll move up, and then move down again because you have to pull them back up. Move your arms forward and back with your hands closed facing the way they are moving. This will keep your upper body up








, If you are moving your legs in a circular fashion, don't point your feet and keep them stiff. If you are kicking back and forth, point your feet downward and kick them constantly.
 Give your body a temporary break from paddling by laying down on your back. You'll still have to paddle with both arms and legs, but not nearly as much as you would have to with your body vertical.
 A log. A paddle. A rubber boat. Whatever it is, use any type of floating material that you can to hold onto and help keep you above water. The less time you spend using energy to stay above water, the longer you'll last.

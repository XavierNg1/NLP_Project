 Fix wherever you need to fix and identify the strength you have.;
, Make sure you're not duplicating anyone. Make sure that you are the one and only person in the world.
 Check the latest trend of style and go shopping. You don't have to be so trendy. Just put on some striking color clothes that have some funky words or pattern on it. Avoid dull colors and change your style.
 Don't be afraid to point out your ideas, and be brave to say and stand for your beliefs!

, Make it phenomenon. Makes people use your phrase too. Trend-setters are the most awesome people all the time.
 People love and look up to people who have leadership and are hardworking. Join any organizing committee and make yourself busy. You'll look cooler than those who do not involve in anything.
 Volunteer to speak in front of the public. People respect others who can speak well. Don't forget to put your awesome phrase out there to make it more viral.
 Socializing is always the key of awesomeness. Learn how to socialize with people to avoid making mistakes that can make you look more like a loser. Have a social network account like Facebook. Put some cool status and comments on your page and you'll look cool.
, Something you do not always do like jungle tracking, going to gym, hanging out in town etc.
 Don't smile in the wrong time and wrong place. It will look awkward and people will get annoyed with you being too positive during negative times or neutral times.
 Write about how awesome you are or any cool stuff you have. People will never know that you're awesome unless you tell them. But don't brag about it too much. For example; I have such great dogs. They know how to roll over, sit, come, shake, and speak. It is the coolest thing ever. I bet you wish you had dogs like mine.

 If you spill oil or another solution on your garage floor, always clean it up right away. These liquids can set in the floor, making them more difficult to clean later on. Use paper towels to mop up the mess, and throw them out when you are done., If you have rust stains on a concrete floor, try pouring lemon juice or vinegar on the stain. Use enough to cover the stain. Wait five minutes, and pour a second dose on top. Using a scrub brush with stiff bristles, scour the stain from the floor.

If this does not work, you can try the same method but with a stronger, store-bought acid or rust remover.
For very tough rust stains, you can mix ten parts water to one part muriatic acid. Apply to the stain, and leave it for five minutes before scrubbing out.Do not use acids or vinegar on epoxy floors., If you have a dried oil stain or if there is oil residue leftover after a spill, find some cat litter containing clay. Spread this over the stain. Leave the litter alone for a few hours or overnight to absorb the oil. Sweep it up when you are done.If the cat litter has not completely absorbed the oil after a day, replace it with fresh litter, and leave it for another day. For bad oil spills, this process can take a few days.
 For oil and grease stains, you can purchase an oil and grease remover. Follow the instructions on the label. Generally, you will apply the solution to the stain, and let it dry. This usually takes several hours. When it is dry, you can sweep it up.These grease removers can typically be bought at a hardware store.
 Gather a box of powdered detergent, a bucket of warm water, and a stiff scrub brush. Sprinkle the detergent over the stain until it completely covers it. Dip the brush in the water, and scrub the stain vigorously until it is gone. When you are finished, wipe up as much detergent as you can with rags or paper towels, and let it dry.

 Immature behavior includes mimicking your parents, talking back disrespectfully, or trying to make your parents even more angry. The urge to snap back at your parents while they are shouting can be almost unbearable, but don't do it. This will only make them angrier and make the situation worse. Keep your comments to yourself, and wait for them to stop shouting.
 Face-to-face communication is much more effective than looking off to the side while someone is talking to you. If you look your parents in the eye, you seem much more honest and genuine about whatever you are saying.
 If there is something specific you did wrong, such as fail a class or lie to your parents, now is the time to apologize and explain yourself. Be sincere and honest about what you did wrong and how you will improve in the future.


Don’t make excuses for something you did.
Taking responsibility for your actions is a very adult thing to do.
Admitting you are wrong can sometimes get your parents to stop shouting; they will appreciate the honesty.
 Chances are, if your parents are shouting, they’re really emotional and upset about something. Once you’ve explained yourself, listen to your parent’s side of the story. They are most likely very concerned about something, and listening will help you understand them.
 When things settle down, tell your parents you feel hurt when they shout at you. They might not know this, and they might not even notice they’re shouting.


Say, “I feel hurt when you shout at me.”
Tell them, “When you shout at me, I feel like crying.”
Request that they act differently, “Next time, can you talk to me in a normal voice?"

 Common areas are on the floor along the baseboards or on windowsills in rooms where you suspect crickets are hiding. This method works best indoors, since tape placed outside will collect dirt, leaves and other creatures.
 The crickets will get caught in the glue as they try to walk across, making it easy for you to pick up and dispose of them. A more expensive option would be to use the sticky traps or "motels" made for catching roaches.

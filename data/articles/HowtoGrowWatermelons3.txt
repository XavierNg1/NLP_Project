 Under perfect conditions, watermelons will mature to full sweetness in about four months of warm weather. Harvesting them before they're ready will result in less flavorful watermelons.


To test the ripeness of a watermelon, thump it. A dull noise sounding back means that it has ripened. Also, check the underside––it is ready when it has turned from white to pale yellow.
The curly tendril near the watermelon's stem should also be dried out when it's ready to harvest., Use a sharp knife or garden shears to cut the watermelons cleanly from the vine near the fruit. Freshly harvested watermelons will keep for about 10 days.

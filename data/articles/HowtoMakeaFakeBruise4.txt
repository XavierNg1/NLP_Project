 You will need food coloring, petroleum jelly, and paper towels. The exact colors you will need will depend on your bruise. Remember that fresher bruises will use more bright reds, established bruises will include darker blues and purples, and healing bruises begin to first display green and then yellow.


This technique is best for smaller bruises, as it is much harder to apply for a realistic look.
 For most bruises, you will want to go with red as the base color. Use yellow instead for nearly-healed bruised.
 Use your index finger to create the general shape of your bruise. If you want a lighter spot in the middle, which often occurs in established and healing bruises, be sure to wipe off any excess food coloring with a paper towel.


Keep in mind that real bruises are usually very irregular. Don't make perfect shapes with the smear. Make the edges uneven and jagged.
 This will be blue or green for newer bruises or brown for healing ones. Mix together red and green to make brown. Put a dot of this second color on top of the base you've already made. Smear it in a similar but not exactly overlapping pattern. Wipe off the excess with a paper towel.


For fresh bruises, instead of a second color stick to red only. Blend and create variations in color intensity with a little water.
 Take a small dab of petroleum jelly with your finger and rub it over your fake bruise to blend. Focus on areas like edges and where the two colors overlap. The more well-blended the bruise, the more convincing it will look. Once you've finished, wipe off the petroleum jelly with a paper towel.

 Many people feel having only one purchase calls more attention to what they're buying. If you want to feel more discreet purchasing feminine products, buy several other items at the same time. This can take some attention away from your pads.However, be careful of the other items you add. You may feel more embarrassed if you buy something that seems related. For example, do not buy new underwear and pads.
Instead, stock up on unrelated items that you need. For example, purchase shampoo and conditioner the same day you purchase pads.;
, If there's a self checkout at your store, take advantage of this. One of the embarrassing things about buying pads is often interacting with the cashier. To avoid this, you can find a store that has a self checkout. When you're done, you can slip your pads into a discreet bag and walk out the door.If a self checkout isn't an option, try going to the least busy register or checking out at the pharmacy section.
 Oftentimes, people feel less embarrassed in the presence of others. If you have female friends who also need to purchase pads, you can all go together. That way, no one person feels singled out or awkward purchasing pads.Ask your friends something like, "Do you guys ever feel weird buying pads alone? Maybe we could go together so no one feels awkward."
You can also ask a parent to pick up pads for you if they're running to the store, avoiding the embarrassment of purchasing them altogether. For example, "Would you mind getting me pads at the store? I feel a little embarrassed going alone."

, Many stores sell pads online, and you can often stock up on supplies for months.Big online retail stores, like Amazon, also sell things like pads. If you're embarrassed to go to the store, see if you can make an online purchase.


Make sure to purchase pads well before your period, however. You don't want to be left without necessary supplies when your period starts.

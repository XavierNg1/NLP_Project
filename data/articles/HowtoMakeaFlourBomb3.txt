 Creating a flour bomb out of a balloon is an easy way to have an explosion of flour. You only need a few household supplies to make a balloon flour bomb. Get all of your materials together to begin this project.


Balloons
A medium size funnel
Flour
A spoon
A needle or pin.
Tape and String to hang the balloon

, Gently slide the mouth of the balloon onto the tip of a funnel. A medium to large size funnel will work best to keep the balloon secured on the funnel.
 Use one hand to hold the balloon mouth and funnel base while you spoon the flour into the balloon. Add 1 to 2 spoonfuls of flour into the funnel for it to slide down into the balloon. Carefully remove the balloon mouth from the funnel making sure not to let any of the flour spill out of the balloon.
 Carefully blow up the balloon to a nice size that will easily pop. Try not to overfill the balloon so it doesn’t pop before you intend for it to. Make sure you only blow out air into the balloon because you don’t want to accidentally inhale the flour inside the balloon. Tie the balloon mouth off when the balloon has reached the size you want.
 Hang the balloon up high with string or just tape to give the flour a place to fall from. Use a needle or pin to carefully pop the balloon. Watch the flour fly from the balloon and fall down to the ground.


For added fun, have someone stand underneath the balloon to end up covered in white flour.

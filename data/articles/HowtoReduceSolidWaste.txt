, Choose to buy items that use no packaging or a minimal amount of packaging. For example, buy apples from a bin rather than wrapped up on styrofoam with plastic around them.
 This helps to promote recycling.
 Most things made from recycled products advertise this fact, so that you know you are helping the environment when you purchase them.
 Keep a recycle bin or bag in your home to place plastic, paper and cans. Carry these recycle items to your recycling station. Some towns offer curb side recycling.
 You can also use newspaper and other biodegradable items to make compost.
 Use these bags in place of plastic or paper bags that will be thrown away. Reuse the cloth bags each time you shop.
 Sometimes, 1 person's trash is another person's treasure. This is a wonderful way to recycle items.
 An example would be to wash and reuse plastic containers rather than using plastic baggies and throwing them in the trash.
 For example, make a pencil holder out of a metal can.
 Soft drink bottles sometimes offer a deposit for returning to the store. Computer ink cartridges can be returned and refilled.
 Avoid throwing items away unnecessarily. Borrow items that you might only use occasionally. Try to fix an item rather than throwing it away, or see if someone else can fix it for you.
 You will save money in the long run and keep these items out of landfills.
 Talk about reducing solid waste in the schools and at community events. Promote ways to reduce solid waste in public service announcements on the radio and television.

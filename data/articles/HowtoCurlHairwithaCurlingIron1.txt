 Turn on the curling iron and heat it to 320 degrees for fine hair and 430 degrees for thicker hair. Experiment to find the right temperature for you. It's best to go with the lowest temperature that does the job. This is going to damage your hair less.;
, Make sure there are no tangles or your curls won’t form properly. Your hair should be completely dry before you curl it. Blow dry any damp sections.
 This product is usually sprayed onto dry hair. The heat protectant will form a buffer between your locks and the iron to add shine and prevent damage at high temperatures.
 Sections should be about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) wide and there should be about three-four sections from the bottom to the crown of your head. Separate the sections using clips so that the only hair hanging has either been curled already or is the next section of hair that is going to be curled.
 Using just the wand (and not the clamp at the bottom of the wand that "holds" the hair as it curls), wrap your section of hair around the barrel. Be sure not to overlap your hair, as this will reduce heat and result in limp sections. Use your fingers to hold the edge of the section of hair close to the barrel without burning your hair. Doing this rather than using the clamp will prevent crimps in the curls.









Be sure to alternate the curling direction between clockwise and counterclockwise for a more natural effect.
 Grabbing the bottom of the curl, compact the curl to create a perfect curl. Use a bobby pin or a similar hair clip to fasten the circle of hair to your head.
 then wait until the curls are no longer hot before you take off the clips.
 Shake out the curls and fix any curls that are messed up








, Unless you want to leave it in its current, more formal arrangement, tousle it with your fingers or tease it slightly. Tousling large curls is a great way to create waves.
 Do not over-spray, as this will make your hair crispy and/or weigh it down.

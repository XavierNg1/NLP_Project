 There are five vertical columns that have candy in them. First try to see if there are any obvious combinations in them. Working from the bottom up is the best way to set off chain reactions. Since the stones are blocking a large part of the gameplay area, remove them first. Any combination that removes one or more stones should be prioritized.


On this game board, there are several obvious combinations, but removing the purple candy on the top right will also clear out two stones, making more room on the board for future combinations.
Below, you’ll see that just seven moves later, that top right corner has two special candies available, with another wrapped candy possible.;
, It’s very tempting to make combinations in the first few rows, but these don’t add to the final goal of clearing out the jelly. Prioritize by clearing out stones, followed by jelly.


Moves lower on the board are better not just because they set off chain reactions, but also since clearing jelly and the aforementioned reactions will give you a higher final score. Don’t forget the minimum required score for this level must be met to clear it.
 Try to make striped candy that will set off a chain vertically. This is best done in the columns that have jelly or stone in them. You can clear out entire columns in one go this way.


On the gameboard above, there is a yellow striped candy that will clear out the entire second jelly/stone column once.



This combination packs the biggest punch as it clears out squares both horizontally and vertically, three rows wide.

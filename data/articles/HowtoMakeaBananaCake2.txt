 All you need is a little bit of butter spread across the pans with a paper towel, or a nonstick cooking spray.
 Use a whisk, an electric mixer, or a stand mixer (like a Kitchen-Aid). It usually helps, furthermore, to pre-scramble the eggs with a fork to make sure the yolks and whites mix in evenly.
 Take these three wet ingredients and mix them together in a small bowl off to the side. Remember that, the darker and more ripe the banana, the better it will be for banana cake, as overripe bananas are sweeter and softer. When done mixing the wet ingredients, add to the oil and egg mixture.
 Mix together all of these powdered, dry ingredients and then use a fork or a whisk to break up any clumps. For perfect cakes, you should sift the flour in, which perfectly breaks up clumps for a nice smooth batter.


Add the walnuts, and if using, the sultanas. Chocolate chips are also a wonderful addition that could go in now, if desired., If you have an electric mixer, this is your best choice. Turn it on low and slowly incorporate the flour mixture into your milk/oil/banana mixture, adding the flour, mixing in 80% of it then adding more flour. Mix until all of the dry ingredients are mixed with the wet., Make sure it is level and without air pockets. A good way to do this is to bang fill the tins up and then bang the bottom of the pans on the counter top lightly, which should shake out any air bubbles.
 If you stab the cake with a skewer, it should come out with no wet batter, only a few crumbs. As soon as you remove the cakes, let them cool for 3-5 minutes and then turn them out onto wire racks to finish cooling completely.

 If you have money to spare, take a stand by giving to organizations that support LGBTQ causes. You can donate to a large institution like the ACLU, the Human Rights Campaign, the Trevor Project, or Lambda Legal. You might also consider donating to smaller local organizations, such as your local fund for queer youth, LGBTQ health center, or Centerlink community center.Help homeless LGBTQ youth. Trans and homosexual youth are at far greater risk of homelessness than heterosexual youth. Consider donating your time or money to a homeless shelter for youth, whether or not it is specifically for queer youth.
 Donate your time to political campaigns for gay-friendly candidates. Volunteer your special skills and your extra time to LGBTQ charities and organizations.If you are highly skilled in any area, such as medicine, teaching, legal work, or administration, offer your services to small organizations that would not be able to afford to hire you.
Volunteer with a suicide prevention hotline. Homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia can cause isolation and suffering that lead to a high rate of suicide among LGBTQ individuals, especially youth. You can complete a simple training and be on-call for LGBTQ people who are suffering from suicidal ideation.
 If you belong to a church or a school, you may find organizations within your institution. If not, search for organizations in your area, ask your friends, and check out a few meetings. Start an affinity group if you don't find anything.


Consider taking on a personal role in the struggle for justice.
Think about what communities you belong to. With whom can you have the most productive dialogue? For instance, if you come from a Christian background, you may do the most good by holding information sessions at churches about LGBTQ issues.

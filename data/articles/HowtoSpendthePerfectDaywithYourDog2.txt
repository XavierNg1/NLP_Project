 What dog wouldn’t love to spend time running around at a dog park? The fresh air, the exercise, and the chance to play with other dogs probably sounds perfect to your dog. Before heading to the park, make sure your dog is healthy and up-to-date with his vaccinations.


Making sure he’s healthy makes it less likely that he will become sick from playing with another dog or eating another dog’s poop.
Contact your veterinarian if you are unsure if your dog is up to date with his vaccinations.
 Dog parks have many benefits for both you and your dog. For example, your dog gets to meet new dogs and have fun with old friends, and you have the chance to meet and socialize with other dog owners.Fortunately, there is more than one way for your dog to have fun at a dog park.


Rather than playing with other dogs, your dog may prefer to explore the environment by sniffing the bushes or navigating through the trees.
If your dog is older and less active, he may want to just enjoy the view rather than play.
Let your dog have different types of fun at the park, as long as he is behaving appropriately with other dogs and people.
 More likely than not, your dog will enjoy his time at the dog park. However, you should observe him closely for signs that he may not be having fun, or is being overly rough with other dogs. If he is feeling playful, he’ll play-bow (hind end in the air), twist or jump in the air, and have an open and relaxed mouth.


Watch your dog for signs of fear (e.g., tucked tail, tensed muscles) and/or stress (e.g., whining or whimpering, hiding behind objects or people). Leave the dog park if your dog is clearly not having fun.
If your dog is being aggressive towards other dogs (e.g., pinning, excessive mounting, snarling, showing teeth), interrupt the play and separate him from the other dogs.

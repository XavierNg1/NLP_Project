 Ask a trusted friend to be the appointed collector of cards at your wedding. Instead of displaying cards out in the open, such as on a gift table, ask your friend to take cards from the guests. Have your gift attendant store the cards in a secure place, such as a locked room, until the end of the festivities., If you donâ€™t want to set up a table to collect cards at your wedding, you can ask your wedding planner or venue staff to collect them for you. Let your wedding planner or staff at the venue where you are holding your wedding know that you want them to collect the cards during your reception.
 Consider ditching the card table altogether. Instead, drop a line in your invitation that tells guests you will be visiting each table during the reception and collecting cards in person. This will give you quality time with your guests and allow you to maintain personal control over the cards., Make sure you take time during your wedding festivities to thank your guests, especially as you collect the cards. Take time to chat with your guests individually as you collect the cards, and make sure you vocally show your gratitude for their cards.
 Whether you collect the cards yourself, or ask wedding staff to do it for you, it is important that your cards end up in a secure spot after collection. This can be a secure hotel room or a locked vehicle.

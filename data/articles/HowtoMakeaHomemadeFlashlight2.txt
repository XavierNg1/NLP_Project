 It's time to beckon the MacGyver within you and get started. You'll need:

2 D cell batteries (separate)






2 5" pieces of number 22 insulated copper bell wire (1" of insulation stripped off both ends)






Cardboard tube cut to 4" in length






PR6, or number 222, 3-volt flashlight bulb






2 brass fasteners (brads)






1" x 3" cardboard strip






Paper clip






Tape






Bathroom-size paper cup







, Wrap it around to secure it. Punch the tabs through the same side of the cardboard tube, but with the wires coming out of different ends. The pointy ends should be sticking out of the tube. This'll be used to serve as part of the on/off switch.
 Make sure the positive of one end is on the bottom of the negative end. Your battery should double in length, not width. Make sure they're firmly attached to each other and slide the batteries into the tube.
 The negative end is the flat one. Masking tape is sufficient for this.
 Place the wire on the positive end through that hole and wrap that wire around the bulb. Place the end of the bulb into the hole so it can be supported by the cardboard.


Place tape around the base of the bulb and cardboard to keep it secure to the wire. It should start flickering on at this point.
 Place the bulb into the hole and secure the cup to the cardboard base with more tape.
 When the pop tab is touching both, it conducts the electricity and turns your flashlight on. If the pop tab is moved, your flashlight turns off. Voila!


You can use a paperclip instead of a pop tab, too!

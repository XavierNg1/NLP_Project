 Crack the eggs into a microwave-safe dish and beat by hand using a wire whisk. Add the milk, salt, and pepper and continue whisking until thoroughly combined.


Note that you could use a 12-oz (375-ml) coffee mug or two 6-oz (180-ml) ramekins instead of the larger dish.



Stir the eggs so that the solid portions and liquid portions swap places.
 The eggs should be set or near set once you finish microwaving them.


Cook for 30 seconds first. If the eggs do not seem solid enough, cook for the additional 15 seconds.
 Scrambled eggs do not store or keep well, even when made in the microwave, so you should enjoy them immediately.

 Everyone is single at one point, and it just so turns out that, at this stage in your life, you aren't with someone.;
, You can go out and enjoy yourself at a disco without worrying about what your girlfriend or boyfriend will think of you while you're doing your embarrassing chicken dance in front of all your friends. You can be yourself without having to worry about meeting anybody's standards or impressing them. You won't have to go on any possibly awkward dates, worry about what you wear or do anything that you don't want to do, such as see the stupid movie that only your girlfriend/boyfriend wants to see.
 'Single Ladies' by Beyonce or 'Riding Solo' by Jason Derulo are pretty good esteem boosters for all those single.
 It will come to you when you are least expecting it, so enjoy life as a single person, and before you know it you will be granted with the gift of a girlfriend/boyfriend.
 If your friends have been bragging to you about their girlfriend or boyfriend, ask them if they can stop and think about how this affects the single people in your friendship circle. Explain how you feel personally, whether it's causing you to feel alone, feel jealousy or a lowered sense of worth.


Explain that you're really happy for your friend(s). However, point out that while their happiness is important to you, you feel that some of the expression of this happiness has crossed over into bragging and has left you feeling down.
 If your friend keeps bragging about his or her relationship, change the topic and focus on something else for a bit. Remind your friend if they keep coming back to it that the time you spend together is about your friendship, not about their relationship.
 Have a girls' night out or have a boys-only hang out session in the park. Do all the things that the opposite gender might not like doing, such as painting your nails or making a crazy biking course full of jumps and other obstacles.

 Many older adults with diabetes are at a great risk of diabetic eye disease. Diabetic eye disease refers to a variety of eye diseases that older adults are at risk of. While researchers do not understand the connection between some eye diseases and diabetes, they are sure that people with diabetes are at a higher risk of eye disease. Diabetic eye diseases include:


Glaucoma, which is a disease in which the intraocular pressure of the eye increases.
Diabetic retinopathy, which is a disease in which small blood vessels in the eyes are damaged.
Cataracts, which is the gradual clouding of the eyes., Older adults with diabetes are predisposed to hypoglycemia, a condition that occurs when blood sugar levels drop below a certain point. Hypoglycemia can result in serious medical problems such as loss of consciousness or coma. As a result, older adults need to be very aware of this potential risk.


Always monitor blood sugar levels.
Carry glucose tablets or sugary drinks or snacks with you to consume if you feel the symptoms of hypoglycemia.
Watch for the symptoms of sweating, fatigue, dizziness, paleness, or blurred vision., One problem for many older diabetes patients is that injuries often do not heal properly. If injuries do not heal properly, the patient may be at risk of more severe medical problems. As a result, all older adults with diabetes should closely monitor any injuries.


Watch cuts. Cuts may heal slower or be more prone to infection for older adults with diabetes.
Pay attention to bruises.
Be cognizant of broken bones.
 A serious danger to older adults with diabetes is cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease may increase the severity of your diabetes and create new problems. To avoid this:


Manage your blood pressure.
Watch your lipid levels.
Monitor your blood sugar.

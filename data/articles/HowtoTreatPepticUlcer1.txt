 Burning stomach pain is the most common symptom of a peptic ulcer, and nausea and heartburn are common, as well. Over-the-counter antacids like Pepto-Bismol, Tums and Rolaids often help the pain, but when the pain keeps coming back, see your doctor to discuss your symptoms.


Other severe symptoms of ulcers can include blood in your vomit (hematemesis) or stool (hematochezia). Seek immediate medical attention if you have nausea and vomiting after eating, your vomit looks dark or like coffee grounds, or your stool has a tarry black appearance.Ask your doctor something like, “I used to get heartburn after eating spicy food, but Tums would always help. Now I feel like the pain is worse and comes back more often. Do you think it’s something other than just heartburn?” It’s helpful to describe your symptoms and how they have changed over time.;
, The most accurate way to test for the presence of H. pylori is with a breath test.However, this test is not used very often in a clinical setting. If you’re having symptoms of a peptic ulcer, your healthcare provider can do this test to determine whether the bacteria is present. The test requires drinking a special liquid and then later blowing into a bag.A stool sample can also be used to diagnose H. pylori infection. This is the best way to detect H. pylori if it is an acute infection.
Be sure to tell your doctor if you are taking any medications, as this can also help with diagnosis. Using NSAIDS, smoking, and alcohol consumption can make this disease worse.
 This is the most frequent method of diagnosing a peptic ulcer. With an endoscopy, your doctor uses a scope (a small visualizing device) to look at your stomach, and possibly take a small sample of the lining to biopsy.This is usually done if you have severe symptoms of peptic ulcers like bleeding, weight loss for no reason, or trouble with eating or swallowing.You may also need an endoscopy if you are over age 45, even without more severe symptoms.

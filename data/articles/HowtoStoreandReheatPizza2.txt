 Allow the oven to completely preheat before placing the pizza inside. The final result will be worth the wait - especially if you're reheating an entire pizza. If you place the pizza in too soon, it could turn out soft in the wrong places. If you follow this method, the pizza will taste similar to the original.
 If you have a baking stone, that's even better, since stones are constructed to evenly distribute the heat throughout your pizza. Also, to make the task of cleaning the baking sheet easier, put parchment paper on the baking sheet before placing the pizza on top of it.


If any of the toppings look unappetizing, remove these before reheating the pizza.






Consider dressing the pizza up with fresh diced tomatoes, basil, mushrooms, and other fresh vegetables. You can drizzle olive oil or add fresh cheese.
 When the pizza is done, the cheese should be bubbly and crispy brown in spots. Remove it from the oven and enjoy.

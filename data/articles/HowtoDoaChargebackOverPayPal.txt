 If you are not sure how to do this, call your credit card company and ask to speak to someone who can help walk you through the process. The exact process will vary based on the credit card issuer.;
, Once PayPal has been contacted, the credit card company will get the money back from PayPal and give it to you. PayPal will then go to the seller and place a hold on the money from the sale in question and request more information.
 PayPal will allow the seller to supply information to dispute the claim, to help prevent fraud. PayPal will send this information to the credit card company and make an attempt to recover the funds from the credit card company. If the seller provides enough proof to convince the credit card issuer to reverse the funds back to PayPal, you will lose the dispute.
 If the company believes PayPal did not provide sufficient information from the seller to validate the sale, then the chargeback will not be reversed and you will be able to keep the funds.

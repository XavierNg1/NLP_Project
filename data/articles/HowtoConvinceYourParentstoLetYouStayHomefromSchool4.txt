 To fake a headache, just rub your head and close your eyes a lot. Lie down on the couch or the floor and keep your hand pressed to your head.When your parents ask what is wrong, mention that your head hurts right behind your eyes. The better you are at describing the pain, the more likely it is they will take you seriously.
 A lot of the time people with intense headaches can't stand bright lights. If someone opens a window, or you're in a room with a lot of sun, avert your eyes. Complain about the brightness.Don't take this step too far. Light sensitivity is common with migraines, but a general headache may not call for it. Use this tactic at your discretion., If you have a headache, the last thing you want to do is engage in any physical activity. Stay in bed. Go to sleep as early as you possibly can.For an added bonus, keep your room quiet. Turn your television off, and don't listen to music. Few parents will believe their children are choosing to stay in a dark room all day with no entertainment.

, Use a tape measure to determine the length and width of your pillow. Take measurements along the seams of the pillow.



Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the width and length measurements of your pillow. If the original pillow is a square measuring 12 inches by 12 inches (30.5 cm by 30.5 cm), the fabric for the front panel of the sham will measure 13 inches by 13 inches (33 cm by 33 cm).
Lay a piece of fabric flat on a flat work surface. The side that will be displayed on your sham should face down.
Use a ruler to measure the length of fabric to cut. Draw the dimensions on the fabric with a colored pencil, holding the pencil against the ruler to achieve a straight line.
Cut along the colored lines with scissors.



Divide the dimensions of the pillow by 3. A 12-inch (30.5-cm) pillow will give you a measurement of 4 inches (10.2 cm).
Add 2 inches (5 cm) to that number. For the 12-inch pillow, the size of the small panel is 6 inches (15.2 cm).



Divide the dimensions of the pillow by 3. If you start with a pillow measuring 12 inches by 12 inches (30.5 cm by 30.5 cm), your result will be 4 inches by 4 inches (10.2 cm by 10.2 cm).
Multiply the new number by 2. For the 12-inch (30.5-cm) pillow, the dimensions are now 8 inches by 8 inches (20.4 cm by 20.4 cm).
Add 2 inches (5 cm) to the total. For the original 12-inch (30.5-cm) pillow, you now have a large panel of 10 inches (25.4 cm).



Lay your fabric on a flat surface, display side down.
Use a ruler and colored pencil to outline the dimensions of the small and large panels onto the fabric.
Cut along the colored lines with scissors.



Lay the smaller back panel face down on your work surface.
Fold down 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) of one edge. Iron the hem to keep it flat.
Sew the edge down with a straight stitch. Use thread that matches the fabric.
Repeat with the larger back panel.



Lay the front panel on the work surface. The right side should face up.
Situate the back panels on top of the front panel. The back panels should face down.
Arrange the back panels so that their hemmed edges meet in the middle of the front panel. There should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) of overlap between the hemmed edges of the back panels.
Pin together the outside edges of the panels. Leave a 1/2-inch (1.3 cm) edge around the perimeter as a hem.
Sew the outside edges of the panels together. Use thread that matches the fabric. Do not sew together the overlapping hemmed edges of the back panels.
 The display sides of each panel should be facing outwards.
 Place the pillow through the opening in between the two back panels.

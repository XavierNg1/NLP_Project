 If your company provides for medical or family leave, there probably will be information about the benefit in your company handbook or other documents you were given when you started working.


You also may be provided an accounting of accrued sick days or vacation time on your check stub.
You may want to find out how sick and vacation time is accrued and make your own calculation, in case your employer's calculations are incorrect. For example, if you've been working for your employer 40 hours a week, and you accrue one hour of sick time for every four hours you work, you should accrue 10 hours of sick time a week. If your check stub shows less, your employer isn't calculating your time correctly and your record will need to be adjusted.
 If your employer doesn't have a dedicated human resources department, talk to whoever is in charge of payroll and personnel matters about how to go about taking your leave.


If you have paid leave built up, including vacation time, your employer may require you to use that up before you use any unpaid leave available to you under state or federal law., If you work in a unionized workplace, your collective bargaining agreement may include leave provisions.


The collective bargaining agreement governs the relationship between you and your employer, and may include leave provisions for catastrophic leave or supplemental sick leave.
In addition, your union may have a leave bank in which employees can donate their unused sick days for individuals who have used all of their leave.
Your union representative can help you determine if there are any leave provisions or other allowances that are applicable to your situation., If your company has a particular policy for requesting leave, such as requiring a certain amount of notice or the use of a certain form, find out those requirements beforehand.

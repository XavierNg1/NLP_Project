 Hold the blowdryer above your head, pointing the warm air down so hit hits your roots.


Don't hold the blowdryer too close to your hair--you could burn your forehead and damage your hair. Keep it at least a few inches away from your hair.
 Move the blowdryer up and down vertically, from the root of your bangs to the ends of your hair. Focus mostly on the roots, as they take longer to dry than the ends.









Make sure the blow dryer is always blowing air down, away from your roots., If you feel your bangs are a little too poofy, brush them downwards while hitting them with another blast from the blow dryer.

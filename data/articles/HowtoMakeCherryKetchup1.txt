 Remove the pits from 2 1⁄2 pounds (about 5 cups or or 1.12 kg) of cherries and put them in a 6-quart saucepan. Stir in the vinegar and sweeteners until they're mixed well. You'll need to stir in:1⁄2 cup (120 ml) apple cider vinegar
1⁄2 cup (170 g) honey
1⁄2 cup (100 g) brown sugar;
, Turn the heat on to high and bring the cherry ketchup to a boil. Turn the heat down to medium, so the mixture bubbles gently. Let the ketchup simmer for 25 minutes.The cherries should become completely soft.
 Carefully pour the hot cherry mixture into a blender or large food processor. Put the lid on and puree the mixture until it's smooth. Pour the puree back into the saucepan and stir in these seasonings:1⁄2 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
1 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne
1⁄4 teaspoon granulated garlic
1⁄4 teaspoon ground cloves
1⁄2 cinnamon stick
Zest of 1/2 a lemon

, Turn the heat on to medium and let the ketchup cook for one hour and 15 minutes. Stir the ketchup regularly to keep it from sticking to the saucepan. The sauce should become thick as it cooks.Keep in mind that your cherry ketchup will also thicken a little once it's cooled.
 Taste the cherry ketchup and adjust the flavors according to your taste. Carefully pour the cherry ketchup into a heatproof container and let it cool a little. You can store the cherry ketchup in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 weeks.If you plan to store the ketchup in a glass mason jar, ensure that the jar is warm or the ketchup has cooled a little before you fill it. This will prevent the hot ketchup from breaking the cold glass of the jar.

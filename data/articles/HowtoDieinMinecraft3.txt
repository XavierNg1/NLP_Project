 Dig straight down until you break through the bedrock. Float down through it and stay in the Void outside the world until you die. You cannot destroy bedrock in Minecraft for consoles or mobile devices, so this is only possible if you are on a computer.
 This is not possible in Pocket Edition or Console edition. Follow these instructions:Open the chat window with T or /.
Type kill and press enter.
If nothing happens, you need to temporarily enable cheats and try again. In single player, press Esc to open the menu, then select Open to LAN → Allow Cheats → Start LAN World.
 If you are playing Minecraft on a phone, tablet, or gaming console, there's only one way to kill yourself. Here it is:Select End Portal Frames in the "Decoration Blocks" section. Place them in a 4x4 square, without any corners.

Create an End Portal by placing an Eye of Ender in each of the twelve portal frames. You can find this item in the "Miscellaneous" section.
Wait for the black portal to appear in the square, then go through it.
Once in the end region, walk off the edge of the land and sink downward. Once you reach 65 blocks below sea level, you'll start to take damage, then die.

 It will look a lot like an older, more healed bruise if you use a regular pencil, but you can use a variety of colors if you want to make it more exciting.


Use regular gray pencil lead, as well as dark blue and purple for your bruise.
 Using the flat side of the pencil lead, rub it on the paper rapidly, coloring it in quite darkly to create a small pile of colored dust that you can put on your skin. Even if you think you've got enough, keep going until you've got a good pile.


Repeat this process with each pencil, creating a separate pile for each. If you try to make one circle, it'll all blend into a kind of brown color which won't look real.
Instead of using regular paper, get a piece of sandpaper to rub the pencil on, so you can get dust without having to waste as much of the pencil.
 Get a little dust on the end of your finger and rub the dust in a circular pattern onto the spot you want to look bruised. Blend out the edges gently to make it look realistic.


If you only use a little, it'll flake off pretty easy. Keep rubbing it in to get it to stick. Make sure you use enough.
 It's usually best to start with the colors and then go over the top with the graphite pencil to make it look as blended and realistic as possible.


Start with the red colors, then start adding darker tints, such as purple and blue, to the bruise. Go over the top with the graphite when you're finished, blending out the edges.
This always will depend on your skin tone and a variety of factors. Use your judgment and play around until it looks like a real bruise.

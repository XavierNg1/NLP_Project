 Something with scrubbing beads is great for opening pores. Washing your face in the shower can save time, and you'll never forget to do it!
, Whilst in the shower, it's best to scrub your face with an acne fighting scrub or wash to keep your skin looking clear; or dry your face once your out of the shower, and apply an acne fighting treatment then.
 If you have dry skin, moisturizer is a must, and even if you don't, there are lotions for both normal, and oily skin types, that soak up oils. Moisturize right after you shower, but dry your face first.
 Even if you hate water, adding a splash of lemon, or ice can freshen it up, and it moisturizes your skin, clears acne, and makes you healthier. Keep a bottle with you all the time.
 Eating will keep your skin healthy looking, and sleep will keep down under-eye circles and puffiness.

 Black permanent markers are the most durable for this task. The lines they make can always easily be seen even through the heaviest crayon or colored marker strokes. Further, they are the only permanent markers capable of withstanding multiple erasings. This is important if your child will be using colored pencils on the project.


Make sure you place an impermeable surface behind your drawing page, something like cardboard or several sheets of thick scrap paper. Otherwise, the marker might bleed through onto the following pages or onto your writing surface.
 Avoid outlines with lots of small, delicate details. Children under the age of six are still struggling to develop their fine motor skills, which include holding a pencil or crayon and coloring.So make your images relatively simple, with widely spaced, ample-sized areas for kids to color within the lines.
 Hereâ€™s where you can truly add a special effects. Think of a name for your book and begin drawing out designs. You might wish to add glitter or use colored markers to add a splash of color to the final product.


Utilize a heavier paper like construction paper for this task, which will add more stability to the book.
When naming your book, think about calling it after your child. This adds yet another level of personalization to the project.

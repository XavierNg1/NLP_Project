 This tank will result in four free mid-slots for resistance amps or active hardeners. Most missions will have rats that dish out one or two damage types. Having four slots free lets you stack up to four resistance amps of a single damage type, or an air of resistance amps for two damage types.






With one of each damage type resistance amp installed, this tank will be prepared to handle, on average, 247/647 damage per second with no skills/all level V skills respectively.






For example, if you are running a mission against Serpentis, who deal Kinetic and Thermal damage only, and use a pair of Kinetic/Thermal resistance amplifiers, your Drake will be able to handle 388/1153 damage per second.






Since full level V skills would take years to complete, a moderately trained Caldari pilot with a mix of level V and level IV engineering skills should be able to handle about 900-1000 damage using a stacked pair of resistance amps.






Using this strategy, your passively tanked Drake should be able to breeze through level IV missions assuming you're careful. Level III missions will be a walk in the park.

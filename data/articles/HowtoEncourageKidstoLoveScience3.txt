 Because of certain historical and social trends, men are disproportionately represented in STEM fields and in academia. To counter these trends, tell your children that both boys and girls can be scientists.Encourage your girls to participate in scientific organizations like Girls Who Code and provide them with science kits like Yellow Scope.
Teach your kids about famous women scientists as well as famous male scientists.
 If kids never have any direct contact with scientists, the notion that science is an enterprise that real people participate in will remain a remote and abstract notion. To help your kids learn to love science, take them to your local science center or natural history museum where they can talk to professional scientists and see how they work., If kids can do science themselves, they are more likely to love it. There are countless books and websites enumerating hands-on science experiments you and your children can do at home. Alternately, buy a prepackaged science experiment kit packed with experiments you might not be able to execute using materials that youâ€™d normally have lying about the house., When you reward kids for reading a science book or conducting a home science experiment, you detract from the value of the learning experience by making it more about the reward than about what they did or learned. It also sends a subtle message that science is a kind of chore, and only worth doing because at the end of it, you get a reward.

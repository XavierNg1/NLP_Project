 Specifically, it is advisable to eat a diet low in fat and high in complex carbohydrates (carbohydrates with a low glycemic index, such as whole grains) to reduce allergy symptoms. Dietary recommendations to help with winter allergies include:


Consume plenty of vegetables (particularly dark, leafy greens, carrots, beets, cabbage, and yams), choose carbohydrates with a low glycemic index (such as whole grains and quinoa), and consume spices (such as garlic, ginger, cayenne, and horseradish).
Avoid caffeine, alcohol, dairy products, red meat, sugar, and wheat as much as possible.
Stay well-hydrated. In addition to a healthy diet, drinking at least eight 8-oz glasses of water daily is important, and more if you are exercising (to compensate for fluid lost in sweat).
 Rest has been shown to boost your immune system's natural effectiveness, and also to diminish unnecessary stress responses that are tied to allergies. The more well-rested you are, the less your allergies will get out of control. Although this is not a guaranteed "cure" for winter allergies, it is a step in the right direction, and something a naturopath would advise as one of the first things to change.
 He can provide you with additional information and strategies specific to the winter allergies you are suffering from.

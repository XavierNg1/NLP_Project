 The bulbs need to be a decent size, otherwise they won't look spectacular when glittered. Unscrew then from the light holders and put the rest of the light arrangement to one side for re-purposing in its own right, or for recycling.;
, Discard any that are cracked, chipped or broken. If they need a clean, give them a wipe down with a damp cleaning cloth. Allow to dry before proceeding.
 That way, you can fix any mistakes as you go and the glue won't dry out on you while preparing each one. Before starting, lay out a sheet of wax paper on the work space––this will catch the glitter and prevent sticking.
, Rotate slowly to add evenly across the entire surface of the bulb.


Choose colors that mean the most to you for celebrating the season. Typical colors include gold, silver, red and green. White for snow is good too, but only use this on white bulbs as the color of the bulb beneath it will show through.
 As it is drying, start the next and repeat as many times as you need to complete the bulbs.
 If the glitter is uneven anywhere, do touch ups and dry as before.
 It's completely up to you how you display them but here are some suggestions:


Arrange the baubles in a large bowl or on a cake stand. Ring with tinsel.
Fill a mason jar with the baubles.
Glue a hanging thread onto the baubles and hang from the Christmas tree.
Fill a large wine glass or brandy balloon with the baubles.
Attach the baubles to a rope or strong string and hang along the wall or over windows or doors.

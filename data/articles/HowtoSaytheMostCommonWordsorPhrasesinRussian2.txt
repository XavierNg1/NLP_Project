 State your name after this phrase. For example, if your name is Tim, say меня зовут Тим (minYA za-vOOt Tim). Expect the person you’re meeting to respond by stating their name. They might not use the phrase меня зовут.


Respond to an introduction by saying очень приятно (OH-chin’ pree-YAHt-na) or “nice to meet you.”
Note that Russians might introduce themselves by saying their last name first.
 Expect a Russian to answer with their first name, patronymic, and last name. Russians use patronymics, or names based on their father’s first names, instead of middle names. Recognize patronymics by their endings -ович (-oh-vich) or -евич (-ye-vich) for men and -овна (-ohv-na) or -евна (-yev-na) for women.For example, a man whose father’s name is Петр (PYO-tr) will have the patronymic Петрович (Pyet-rOH-vich) and a woman whose father’s name is Евгений (Yev-gYEn-ee) will have the patronymic Егеневна (Yev-gYEn-ee-yev-na).
Think of the patronymic as a way to say “Mr.” or Mrs.”
Address someone by their patronymic if they use it when telling you their name.
 Expect the person you’re meeting to answer with their first name or even their nickname. Call the person by the name they use when they introduce themselves. In this situation you can even use their nickname.

 Even if your house is tidy, there are always chores you put off until later. Wash the windows, clean the ceiling fans, or degrease the oven. These tasks typically don’t take more than an hour to do, but they will make that time go by more quickly., Draw a picture. Write a story or a song. Bake a cake. There are many ways to be creative. However you want to do it, being creative can really make time speed by., This will help you concentrate on other things. Start with a list of things you can accomplish pretty quickly. For instance: make the bed, do laundry, pay bills, and buy groceries. Done with your list and still have time? Do some long term planning. What do you want to accomplish this week, this month, this year? Write your goals down and think of how you can efficiently achieve them., If you’re still in school, get a jumpstart on that report you’ve been procrastinating. Maybe you’ve been avoiding cleaning the gutters or responding to work emails. Whatever homework, housework, or employment work you’ve been putting off, get it done. It will have to be done eventually, and the concentration will keep your mind off of the time., It may sound silly, but many people who are anxious about time passing are also not great at getting enough sleep. If you’re counting the minutes, close your eyes and count some sheep instead.

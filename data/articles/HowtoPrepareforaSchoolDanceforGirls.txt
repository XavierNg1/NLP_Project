 School dances can be fun and memorable, but not everybody likes dancing in front of a lot of people.;
, You've decided you're going to the dance. If you need a ticket, buy one. Some schools also require you to show them your i.d. at the entrance.
 You can go with a date if you want, but it's pretty normal to go with a group of friends. But if nobody will go with you, you will most likely see people there from school that you know and can hang out with.
 Depending on how much you're going to dance, you're going to get sweaty, so wear a tank top. The first dance I went to was a Halloween dance in middle school, and I wore a costume and my makeup started literally running off my face, leaving a trail of red and blue. The point is, you're going to get sweaty. If it's a formal dance, like prom or homecoming, you should wear a skirt or a dress. But if it's a casual dance, then a skirt and a pretty top or jeans and a fancy top is fine. It depends on your dancing style, but for a casual dance you should not wear high heels. The best shoes you can wear to a casual dance are cute flats or converse.
 If the dance is today, don't worry, you can find out in a few hours, but if it's in the future, it will be smart to start now. Find some music that will probably be found in a dance and listen to it. Examples of music found in a school dance:


Poker face by Lady Gaga
Every time we touch by Cascada
Down by Jay Sean
Meet me Halfway by the Black Eyed Peas
Low by Flo-Rida
And other fast music like that.
 If you're still worried, just do whatever everyone else is doing. HAVE FUN! make up your own moves, be funky!

, If a bunch of your friends don't want to stay, suggest that you all go out for ice cream or hang out in the parking lot or the food court.
 If one of them is your friend and you feel bad for them, explain to your date that you want to spend a song with her and dance with your friends. If he says it's not okay, suggest that he go grab a soda.

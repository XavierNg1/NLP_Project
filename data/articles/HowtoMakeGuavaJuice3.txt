 Wash 2 green guavas. Use a sharp knife to carefully chop the guavas into small cubes. Put the cubed guavas into a blender or food processor., Pour 1/2 cup (120 ml) of water into the blender with the guavas. Blend the guava mixture just until the it's smooth. If you blend it too long, the seeds will become finely ground. This will make it difficult to strain them out and your guava juice will be gritty., Set a fine mesh strainer over a bowl and scoop the guava mixture into it. Stir the mixture so it passes through the strainer. Discard the seeds left in the strainer and pour water into the strained guava puree according to your taste.For example, if you like thick guava juice, you may only want to add a little more water. If you prefer a thinner guava juice, try adding another cup or 2 (240 to 480 ml) of water to the guava.
 Zest a little bit of fresh lime zest into the strained guava juice. Squeeze the lime and add all of the juice to the juice along with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of honey and 1 pinch of salt., Taste the guava juice and add sugar according to your taste. Divide the juice between four serving glasses and serve them immediately.For a colder drink, add a few ice cubes to each glass just before you serve the drinks.

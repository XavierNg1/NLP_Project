Make sure there aren't any molds on the tubers or potato.;
,


Tubers will usually appear in a clump, if so the whole part can be cut off as chunk.
Do not remove the skin.



Leave the cut pieces on a hard surface to dry.
Position the pieces ensuring the wet, skinless sides are in the air.
It may take up to 1-2 hours for the potatoes to properly dry. They are ready when the cut pieces are no longer wet when touched.
 Just make sure they aren't cramped together.



The cut side is facing down, the tubers are facing upwards.



Sometimes when watering the potato is exposed, cover the potato with more soil.
 After a few days, green sprouts will appear from the ground.
 The soil must always be wet.


When the tubers branch out into green stems, water with about 1-2 inches of water.

If flowering, wait until the plant dies.



If the potatoes are still small, leave them for a few days and harvest the bigger ones.

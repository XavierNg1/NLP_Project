 Bend your knees and get low to the ground. Hang your head low. When you stand up quickly after you've been crouching, sitting, or laying down for a while, the blood rushes from your head, and your brain is momentarily knocked off of its usual equilibrium.If you haven't been sitting or laying down for long, try crouching down and breathing rapidly to simulate the process.


Be aware of external factors. The lightheaded effect will be more intense if you're hungry or dehydrated, or if the air is hot and humid.If you get too lightheaded, you might faint or vomit.
Consider standing on your head or performing a handstand. Turning yourself upside-down is a very quick way to bring blood to your head. The process is essentially the same: stay upside-down for a minute or two until your head is heavy – then stand. Make sure that you have plenty of neck support.;
, In theory, this will increase your blood flow and temporarily raise your blood pressure – especially to your head and lungs. Keep breathing and crouching for at least thirty seconds, and as long as several minutes. Bear in mind that the longer you stay down, the more likely you are to feel lightheaded upon standing.


The heavier and faster you breathe, the higher your heart rate will go. This will cause your blood flow to quicken.
 Hold your head high, and don't move around much. The blood pressure should drain from your head, suddenly. You should feel lightheaded almost immediately.


Your vision may go dark. You may see spots, "stars", or bright points of light dancing before your eyes. You should feel an overwhelming head rush.
 It's best to stand still for a few moments and enjoy the sensation. Let your vision return, and let your brain restore its balance. If you try to walk while you're very lightheaded, you might trip, fall, or bump into something.

 If you haven't mastered the art of building roller coasters by the time you reach this scenario, you'll want to go to a different scenario and get some practice before taking this one on. Since you can't touch the landscape, you'll have to build around the trees, which can be nerve racking. In addition, you're not allowed to raise or lower the land/water level, which will make constructing underground rides in this scenario much more difficult.
 The first step to completing this scenario is to begin building small, compact rides that don't take up a lot of space. Your best bet is to set up thrill rides and shops on both sides of the valley. If you're adding any scenery, be careful, as the restrictions also count towards any scenery placed in the park. Even if you can fit a ride somewhere, you'll have to make sure that you can build a pathway there., Consider putting Steel Roller Coasters in this scenario, and be super careful about where you put them. Make them tall so you can add twists and turns that go above the trees. Once you get down into the woods, it's hard to do much of anything. In fact, you'll only want to stick close to the land when you're trying to bring the ride's path back to the station., This scenario will push your creativity to the max. You'll have four in-game years to achieve your goals in this scenario, so you won't need to rush yourself and your designs. Yes, your guests will still ride your coasters, gentle rides, and thrill rides, but you'll need big-ticket attractions to get 1000 guests by Year 4., You'll want to fit as many rides as you can into the provided scenario. If you haven't reached the objective, build the park up and attract guests slowly and methodically, and you will eventually succeed. The park doesn't seem to be that big, but you'll find out that it's larger than necessary. If necessary, you can resort to marketing campaigns.

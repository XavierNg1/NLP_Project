 The Magic Mouse's On/Off switch and battery compartment are both on the bottom of the mouse.;
, To do so, slide the circular On/Off switch that's near the front of the mouse (on a green track) down. The green track should disappear when you do this.
 This tab is at the bottom of the mouse; sliding it down toward the rear end of the mouse will cause the cover to pop up.


If the cover doesn't come up when you slide the tab down, use something thin (such as a guitar pick) to pry the cover up while holding down the tab.
 Doing so will remove the cover and reveal the two AA batteries inside.
 This is easiest to accomplish if you use your fingernails or a thin plastic object to pry each battery out by its front or back end.


Never use a sharp metal object to remove batteries, as doing so will risk puncturing a battery or harming the mouse's internals.
 Both batteries will have the + ends facing the front of the mouse and the - ends toward the rear of the mouse.


Some Apple mouse users have experienced issues with Duracell batteries. For best results, try to find high-quality batteries (e.g., Energizer batteries)., You'll need to make sure that the slot for the black tab is aligned with the black tab at the bottom of the mouse.
 This will snap the cover back into place., Doing so will reveal a green track, and a small light in the top-right corner of the mouse's underside should come on, signifying that your mouse is on.
 Once the mouse connects to the computer, you'll be able to start using it again.


You may want to keep an eye on your mouse's battery life to ensure that your mouse doesn't die at a bad time.

 Come to reconciliation. See a Priest and tell him what you have done. When you go in start by saying "Bless me father for I have sinned, my last reconciliation was (blank) these are my sins..." and don't hold back. He won't tell anyone, even if you committed a serious crime.;
, Listen to what the Priest says. He will tell you what good penance might be. It could be anything from 3 Hail Mary's, to just apologizing.
 If it's just a prayer, you can do it while you're still in the church. If you should apologize, go find the person or at least call them up!

, You have been cleansed of your sins. Go in hopes that you will not sin again.

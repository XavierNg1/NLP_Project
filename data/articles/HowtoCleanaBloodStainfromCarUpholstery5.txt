 Moisten the affected area with 3% hydrogen peroxide and allow the stain to sit for about 30 seconds. Keep careful track of time, allowing the peroxide to sit for too long could do damage to your fabric.Hydrogen peroxide, while highly effective at cleaning blood stains, should be used as a last resort. This substance has bleaching properties, and can weaken the fabric of your upholstery or, in some cases, discolor it. Test a small hidden area before using hydrogen peroxide., If any stain remains after you have blotted the area clean, you can repeat the process, reapplying the peroxide and blotting it until the blood stain is gone.
 A clean cloth, thoroughly moistened with cold water, should be used to rinse the remaining solution from the stained area. Be sure to rinse the area well; leaving behind peroxide may discolor or damage your upholstery.
 By blotting the rinsed area with a clean, dry towel, you can pull out excess moisture until only a damp spot remains, which you can allow to air dry.

 Your new dog will listen to you better once it feels comfortable with you. Make sure your dog is happy and satisfied in its new home. Play with it daily, give it a lot of attention and affection, and make sure to feed it regularly.You should feed an adult dog twice a day at the same time – once in the morning and once in the evening, according to your veterinarian’s instructions.
 A hyperactive dog has trouble following commands because they have too much energy that needs to be expelled. They can’t focus on listening to you as well if they are trying to deal with all of their pent up energy and excitement. If you want your dog to listen to you, give it plenty of exercise daily to help release the excess energy.Depending on the breed, you should try to take your dog for a walk for at least 30 minutes every day.
After your dog has had its walk or a good play session with you, it should be able to focus on training and listen more attentively.
 Keep your dog up-to-date with its vaccinations and yearly health checks to make sure it remains healthy. If the dog persistently has trouble following your commands, you may want to check with your vet that there are no problems affecting your dog, such as a problem with hearing.When you get a new dog, you should take it to the vet within the first few weeks to make sure its vaccinations are current and that there are no obvious medical issues that need to be addressed.

 Using rubber stamps is a fun way to create your personalized stationery, and most craft and hobby stores have a wide variety of stamps and inks to choose from. Pick up a few letter stamps to create your very own letterhead, or choose autumn leaves or a snowflake to create a seasonal scene.
 To cover your rubber stamp with ink, tap the stamp into the ink pad several times. Do not press as this can damage the rubber and collect more ink than necessary. After tapping the stamp, check to see that it is adequately covered with ink., With the paper in place on a flat, hard surface, gently lower the stamp onto the section where you wish the image to appear. Be sure to gently press the stamp down. Wiggling the stamp can cause the image to smear and damage the stamp., Place your stamped paper in a safe, dry place to allow the ink to dry. To avoid smearing the ink, do not stack your stationery papers. Drying time will vary depending upon what type of paper or ink you used. Dye-based ink will dry in a few minutes, while pigment ink can take several minutes to several hours to dry.Pigment ink will not dry on glossy paper, so be sure not to combine these two., After each use, clean the stamp with alcohol-free baby wipes or mild soap and water. Cleaning the stamp will help prevent the inks from blending together, and it will help keep your stamp in like-new condition!

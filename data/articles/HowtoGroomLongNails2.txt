 Use a small, clean bowl filled with warm water and soak each hand for 3-5 minutes. This will soften your nail bed and make clipping and filing easier for you., The most common nail shapes are square, oval and squoval (a combination of a square and oval – essentially a square shape with rounded edges), but choose the shape that works best for you. If you aren’t sure which shape to choose, check out the shape of your cuticles and then shape your nails similarly.Square nail shapes are the most durable because they span the entire width of the nail bed.Aesthetically they look best on long fingers with wide nail beds, but this shape is popular in general.
The next best option is squoval, as far as sturdiness is concerned. This shape looks great on any hand., There are many types of nail files, including glass files, emery boards and metals files. For shaping the nails, opt for a glass file.The coarser grit allows for more control when shaping.


If you need to remove a significant amount of length before you shape your nails, use nail clippers to carefully clip your nails to be slightly longer than your desired length and use a file to eliminate the rest while shaping., Filing back and forth can weaken your nails. Instead use smooth strokes in one direction when filing, starting with one side and then moving on to the other.


Be sure to use your file to smooth away any rough edges after shaping your nails. Rough edges can cause snags and leaving behind any sharp points can be dangerous.
 This will smooth away any dents, ridges and leftover nail polish from your nail. Buff the entire nail but also the tips of your nails, which will smooth away any residual ridges after filing.

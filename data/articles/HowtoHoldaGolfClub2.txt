 To achieve this grip, simply scoot your dominant hand down the grip of the club so that there is no space between the fingers of your two hands. Instead of interlocking or overlaying your pinky finger, you grip the club like a baseball bat.








This grip is often used by novices, players with small hands, and players with arthritis.
The baseball grip can also give you more leverage which can allow you to hit the ball farther.
Note that with this grip you may not get as accurate a shot.
Keep in mind to lead with your hips when swinging and follow with your hands.
 To achieve the Vardon grip, take the pinkie finger of your dominant hand and move it back to lay on top of the fingers of your left hand. It should sit on top of the space between your index and middle fingers.









The Vardon grip is the most common and is the traditional textbook grip.
It is especially recommended for people with large hands, and can be more comfortable for those players than the interlocking grip.
Players with small hands may find it difficult.
 To achieve the interlocking grip, separate the index and middle fingers of your non-dominant hand. Move the pinkie of your dominant hand into this space so that your two hands interlock.









This grip is often recommended for younger or weaker players, but is also used by many golfing greats like Tiger Woods. It works best for players with medium or average hands.
The interlocking grip reduces tension and excess wrist movement, but some players find it uncomfortable.

 You’ll want to choose a deep, somewhat dark red for the right look. You can go to a stylist to have it professionally done, or you can purchase a home dye kit. It’s good to take a picture with you to the stylist so that he or she can match the color to how you want it.


If you do not want the expense and long term commitment of dying your hair, you can simply purchase a wig similar to Erza’s hair. When you dress with this option, be sure that your own hair is kept up tightly under the wig.;
, Again, if you don’t want to style your own hair, try to find a wig that has bangs you can sweep to the side. If you already have bangs, you can style them to the side to match Erza’s style. If you go to a stylist, it is good to take a picture for this look, too.If you don’t want to cut your hair into bangs, but you aren’t wearing a wig, you can buy clip in bangs to give your hair the finishing touch.
 If your hair is wavy or curly, grab a heat protectant spray and your flat iron. First, spray your hair with the spray, then carefully straighten your hair.


To add some extra style to the look, give your hair a shiny, healthy look.
Erza has very straight hair, so to make the cosplay look right, this part is important.

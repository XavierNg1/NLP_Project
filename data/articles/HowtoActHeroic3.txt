 Many people believe that when you engage in a heroic action, you are doing so voluntarily and not because you are obligated to do. This means, for example, that you act on your own accord, and not at the behest of another individual or organization., When you act heroic, you are not doing so to feel better about yourself or for material gain. To most people, a heroic act is selfless and done in service to another individual or a community.
 When most people think of a hero, they think of someone who has risked their quality of life, social standing, or physical health and comfort to help someone else. For example, acting heroic can involve taking a psychological, social, or material risk as you perform an action in the service of another. Many view risk as a defining characteristic of acting heroic.

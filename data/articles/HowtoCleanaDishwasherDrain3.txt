 Before you begin troubleshooting a clogged drain in your dishwasher, you should always disconnect the power to the machine. This can be done by removing the plug from the outlet. You could also remove the fuse from the fuse box or turn the appropriate breaker off to ensure that the power is completely disconnected., Your dishwasher ownerâ€™s manual will likely come with instructions that will tell you how to locate and disconnect the hose from the dishwasher., Once you have located the hose, use pliers to pinch the wire clamp and slide it up the hose. You should also place a catch basin under the hose, to collect any spills that may come out of the hose., Once the hose has been disconnected, try wiggling the hose to loosen any debris that may be trapped. Then, insert a straightened wire coat hanger or auger into the hose and remove any clogs that may exist.Alternatively, you can try running high pressure water through the hose to remove any clogs. Use a garden hose to blast out debris that may be trapped.
 Once the clog has been removed from the hose, reattach the hose to the dishwasher. Plug in the dishwasher and run the machine on a normal cycle with no dishes. The dishwasher should now drain properly and water should no longer pool in the bottom of the machine.

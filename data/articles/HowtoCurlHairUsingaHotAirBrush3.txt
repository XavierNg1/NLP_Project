 With short hair, it can be more difficult to divide your hair into sections because of the different lengths. You may have to divide your hair into 3-4 sections as opposed to just 2. Hold each section in place with pins or a hair tie until it is time to use the hot air brush on each section.


As with long hair, you should still use the hot air brush on small sections of hair (roughly 1 inch) at a time.
 Using a hot air brush on short hair is a bit different than using it on long hair. Lift up your first piece of hair and place the hot air brush underneath it, near the roots. With your brush hand, twirl the hot air brush outwards while keeping it against your roots. With your free hand, hold the section of hair down on top of the twirling hot air brush with your palm. Each section should be brushed for 15 seconds.With short hair, the hot air brush will give you waves and volume as opposed to curls.
 Curl the remaining sections of your hair with your hot air brush, working on one section at a time. After you use the hot air brush on each piece of hair, give it a light spritz with flexible hair spray.
 Hot air brushes are great tools to use when styling short hair. Twirl your hair with the hot air brush to easily create volume and hair flips. Take small sections of hair at a time, wrap them around the hot air brush, and twirl the hot air brush for 15 seconds. Repeat this until you've styled all of your hair.Use hairspray to hold these styles in place.
 Using a hot air brush to dry your hair will dry it and style it at the same time. Dry one small section of hair at a time, and apply smoothing and volumizing serums. Brush each section in a twirling method as if you were simply styling it. Brush each section until it is fully dry. Your hair will look similar to how it looks after getting a blowout.

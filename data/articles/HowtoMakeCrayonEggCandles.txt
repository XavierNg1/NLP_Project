 Wash the eggs thoroughly with warm water to prevent food borne illness.
 Using a thumbtack, poke a hole through the top and bottom of each egg. Your grip should be fairly loose so that the egg does not break. The hole should be about the size of the top of the thumbtack.
 Place your mouth on one end and blow until the eggs are completely empty., Place the eggs into a bowl of warm soapy water so that they fill. Once the eggs are filled, blow through each egg to empty them., Place the eggs in the refrigerator for about 2 days to allow them to completely dry., This will allow them to melt faster and have an even consistency. Use about 3 ounces of paraffin wax per egg.
 Each color crayon should have its own container.
 The paraffin wax will turn clear.


Fill a pot up with water
Place the plastic containers of wax and crayons in the water so that they float
Bring the water to a boil

, Using a glass thermometer, make sure the paraffin wax is at 125 °F (51.7 °C) or more., Pour the melted paraffin wax directly to the melted crayon., Trim the wick so that there is at least half an inch sticking out from each side.
 This allows the egg to not leak by having a solid seal.
 Using a funnel, overfill the eggs to assure they are filled to full capacity.
 As the wax starts to cool, you'll notice the egg is no longer filled to full capacity. You'll need to refill the eggs about 3-4 times., Place the eggs in the refrigerator for about 2-3 hours to allow the wax to completely cool.,, This can be done by knocking the eggs on a counter or hitting them all around with a spoon or other utensils.
 If the shells are sticking to the wax, use a knife to peel it off.
, Use a hair dryer on low heat to just slightly melt the wax. Rub your finger over the wax to give it a shine finish.
 This will flatten down the bottom allowing it to stand on its own.

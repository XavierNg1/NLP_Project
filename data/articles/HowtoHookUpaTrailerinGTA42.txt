 Once you’ve installed the mod, launch GTA 4 and load your saved game.
 These trucks are often found around the port area of Liberty City. You can get one that’s driving around or take one that’s parked.
 The mod you’ve installed has now placed trailers and trucks in these areas.
 Make sure that the tail of the truck and front of the trailer is aligned.


As you back down, you’ll notice two lights: one at the tail of the truck and one at the top of the trailer. These will serve as guides.
Once you’ve properly hooked up the trailer to your truck, the orb at the top of the trailer will turn from green to red, signaling that you’ve connected the two properly.
Congratulations! You can now drive around Liberty City with a truck and a trailer!

 Dissolve the dry yeast in 60 grams of water for 5 minutes to activate it.
 Put the flour, salt, sugar, and milk powder in a large bowl and stir to mix them together., Crack one egg into a bowl and whisk it until its yolk and whites are combined., Add the beaten egg and the activated yeast to the bowl of dry ingredients and mix until all ingredients are combined., Continue to mix the dough together as you gradually add in the remaining 60 grams of water., Place your dough onto a cutting board or smooth surface and start kneading it. Continue kneading until you can stretch out the dough so it's very thin (approximately 1 millimeter thick), and holes form in the stretched dough., Incorporating the butter at this point, rather than at the beginning, makes it easier to knead the dough as the gluten has already formed., Keep kneading until the dough is smooth and flexible, but ensure not to overwork the dough., Put the dough into a large bowl, and cover it either with plastic wrap or with a clean cloth. Leave the dough to rest for approximately 1 hour until it grows to 2-2.5 times its original size., Take the dough and shape it into a thick, log-like shape. From there, cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Take each piece and roll it into a ball with your hands., Put each ball onto a baking sheet, cover them again with plastic wrap or a cloth, and let them rest for approximately 15 more minutes., Crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk it together with the 2 tablespoons of water until combined. Brush each dough ball with this egg wash., Place the baking sheet into the oven and bake the dough at 165 degrees for approximately 35 minutes., Once the dough has baked, place the baking sheet on a cooling rack.

 The rule is that a negative times a negative equals a positive.Point out to students that, while numbers with opposite signs will have negative products, numbers with the same signs will have positive products, whether the two numbers are positive or negative.

For example, −2×−4=8{\displaystyle -2\times -4=8}.
 This is similar to the way students use repeated subtraction to multiply a negative and a positive number. This time, however, since neither factor is positive, the students will need to subtract a negative number.If necessary, review the rules of  adding negative numbers, which state that subtracting a negative is the same as adding it. You can use a number line to show the student that if you start at a negative number and take a negative amount away from it, you are moving towards the right on the number line. Remind the student that moving to the right on a number line means adding.

When students are using repeated subtraction to multiply a negative by a negative, they can think of either number as the negative number being subtracted, and the other number being the number of times the negative number is subtracted.

For example, −2×−4=−(−2)−(−2)−(−2)−(−2)=8{\displaystyle -2\times -4=-(-2)-(-2)-(-2)-(-2)=8}.

Also, −2×−4=−(−4)−(−4)=8{\displaystyle -2\times -4=-(-4)-(-4)=8}.
 These often involve scenarios in which someone is having someone else pay off a debt; that is, when someone is subtracting debt.

For example, “After college, Rob has -37,849 dollars to his name. His mom agrees to pay 4 of his student loan bills, which are 383 dollars each month, until he finds his feet. How much more money does Rob have after those 4 months?”

In this example, you would multiply −383×−4=1,532{\displaystyle -383\times -4=1,532}. This means that Rob has a negative amount of money (a debt), taken away four times. This leaves him with $1,532 more than he had at the start of the 4 months.

 Some parents feel that toddlers shouldn't be playing with blood drenched knives, or five year olds should give the nooses and decapitated heads a break. Other parents find it to be all fun and games, while still others think Halloween in and of itself is inappropriate, and instead lean toward harvest themes. Figure out exactly what you deem appropriate for the age group you are serving.;
, Remember, parents love to see their young kids having a great time in their Halloween costumes. Parents also like to drag along the older kids to keep an eye on them. Make sure you'll have enough supplies for everyone who ends up coming.
 Nothing kills a party like bad food. Decide exactly what you plan on serving. Lunch? Dinner? Snacks? Cocktails? (for the adults, of course). Make sure that there is plenty of food for everyone to leave stuffed and smiling.
 If you aren't the creative type, stop by your local party store and see what Halloween/Harvest themed games they have laid out. Remember to get games that are age appropriate for the guests. For younger children, bean bag tosses are excellent. For older children, more challenging games would be more appropriate.
 Games are always more fun when there is something at stake.
 Perhaps candy can be your prize. Regardless, there must be candy available for the children as well as their parents.
 Once again, use your discretion. Severed hands and toddlers don't usually mix well.
 Lay out the food, put out the games where there's lots of space, double check your decorations and get ready for your guests to role in!

, Really, what is cuter than kids fumbling over their costumes and mussing up their face paint? These moments never come by again. Cherish them.

 For a basic Midori sour, an Old Fashioned or on the rocks glass, which typically holds about 8 ounces (237 ml), is the best option. Place enough ice in the glass to fill it.If you prefer, you can mix all of the ingredients for the Midori sour in a cocktail shaker with ice and then pour it into the glass.;
, After you’ve added the ice to the glass, pour 1 ½ ounces (44 ml) of melon liqueur, 2 ounces (59 ml) of sour mix, and 1 ½ ounces (44 ml) fresh lime juice to the glass. Use a cocktail stirrer to mix all of the ingredients together well.Midori is the best known brand of melon liqueur, and is obviously where the cocktail gets its name. However, you can use any melon liqueur to make the drink.
You can use store-bought sour mix to make the cocktail. However, you’ll get a fresher tasting drink if you mix up your own sour mix.
 Once all of the other ingredients are mixed, add a splash of lemon-lime soda. Float an orange slice in the cocktail as a garnish, and serve.If you prefer, you can substitute a lemon or lime slice for the orange.
Instead of floating the orange slice in the glass, you can place a wedge on the rim if you prefer.

 You don't even need a basketball hoop yet.;
,, Flick your wrist so the ball spins while in the air. End with a follow through.
 Don't let it touch your palm. Repeat until you are very comfortable and can do it with ease.
 Do that same motion, but push the ball towards the hoop. Make sure you push high enough to get over the rim and into the hoop. Remember to push up not out. Pretend to end with your hand in the hoop.
 You can put your weak hand on the side of the ball, but don't push with it, just use it to guide the ball in the direction you want it to go.
 Once you get better (after practice), try shots from different spots on the court.

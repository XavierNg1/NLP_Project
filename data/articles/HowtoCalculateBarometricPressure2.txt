 In gauging weather trends and analysis, the absolute value of the pressure is nowhere nearly as significant as its "trend." Namely: is the barometric pressure rising, is it falling, or is it holding steady? Watch the barometer needle and record its movements.

The dials of older barometers often feature artistically-drawn backgrounds to indicate weather conditions like storms, strong winds, and clear skies. For all their aesthetic, these backgrounds can be misleading. The movement of the barometer needle has far more bearing upon the coming weather. 

If you have an old, traditional mercury tube-type barometer, then you may need to watch the meniscus: the highest curve of the liquid mercury that fills the cylinder.
 To determine the trend in a barometer, you need to compare the current pressure reading to a past pressure reading. Calculate the difference in pressure between the current reading and the reading from an hour ago.

In many barometers, you can manually set a needle to mark a point on the pressure gauge. The needle will remain at this point to help you gauge recent trends in the pressure.
 The higher you go, the lesser the pressure. This means that a barometric pressure that would send someone straight through the trapdoors of a storm cellar at sea level along the coast of Costa Rica would be perfectly commonplace in the midst of summer in the mile-high city of Denver.

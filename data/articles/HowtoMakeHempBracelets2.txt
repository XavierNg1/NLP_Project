 To create a beaded bracelet, you will need natural or dyed hemp and beads of your choice. Any kind of bead will work as long as it has a hole that fits the hemp strands, but seed beads are the best for this project.
 You will need three strands of hemp cut at about 16 inches (40.6 cm) long each. The strands will be braided together, so the finished bracelet won’t be nearly so long.
 Hold the three strings together so that they are even, and tie them off on one end with about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the strands on one end of the knot. This will be used to attach the bracelet to your wrist when it is finished.
 Do a classic braid beginning at the knot. Spread the three strands out, and then cross the right strand over the center. Then, cross the left strand over the center piece.
 Continue the pattern of adding the right strand over the left, and then the left over the right, until you have reached ⅓ of the way across the desired length of your bracelet.
 After you cross the right strand to the center, slide on a bead and then cross the left strand over it. Do the same again, crossing the right strand, adding a single bead, and then crossing the left strand, until you’ve completed another ⅓ of the bracelet.
 After adding enough beads, go back to regular braiding until you’ve finished the final ⅓ of the bracelet. Tie a knot and cut off the excess hemp about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the knot.
 Make several bracelets and stack them for a bohemian feel, or wear a single bracelet just for fun. Use the loose ends of the string to tie a knot around your wrist or ankle, and enjoy!

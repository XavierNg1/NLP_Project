 Make sure to use an extension cord that’s long enough to cover the area you will be trimming. Some weed whackers have a clip on the handle where you can loop the extension cord. This prevents it from disconnecting if it gets caught as you use the weed whacker.


Some electric weed whackers are battery powered. If this is the case, you’ll need to make sure you’ve charged the weed whacker before trying to start it.Make sure the trigger isn’t held down when plugging in the weed whacker.
 The advantage of electric weed whackers is they’re ready to be used once they’ve been plugged in. The line will start spinning as soon as you pull the trigger. Make sure to keep the weed whacker away from you and any surface that could be damaged by it., While a gas powered weed whacker demands several steps before starting, electric weed whackers are much simpler. You won’t find a kill switch or a pull cord on an electric weed whacker. You should only need to pull the trigger to get it working.

 If you are already a service repair technician or mechanic or in a similar field, the transition to becoming an ultrasound service technician will feel natural.


If you do not have experience in any of these fields, especially if you do not have experience working at all, it is best to first get experience working as a general service repair technician. Then it is easier and more appropriate to enter this highly specialized field.;
, There are very few schools which have accredited training for ultrasound service technicians, so you may be restricted to finding one in a big city.
 Be aware that this is likely not the end of your formal training. To reach and stay at the top of your chosen field, you will need to actively pursue additional training throughout your career and stay abreast of developments in this fast-advancing field.
 Learn everything you can about the inner and outer workings of the ultrasound machines, including different brands, types, and designs of ultrasound machines.
, Contact companies that sell and service ultrasound machines. Contact hospitals, clinics, imaging centers, and ultrasound clinics.

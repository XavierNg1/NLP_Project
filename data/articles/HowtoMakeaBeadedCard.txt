 These are listed below under "Things You'll Need".;
, Using the ruler, draw a rectangle from the card measuring 8.25" (21 cm) x 5.5" (13.5 cm). Cut out the rectangle with the scissors, and fold it in half so it forms a card with a surface measuring roughly 4" (10 cm) x 5.5" (13.5 cm).
 Measure this piece into a 3.5" (8.5 cm) x 5" (13 cm) rectangle. Cut it out.



Glue it onto the front of your card. Make sure it is centered, so that an even border of the first colored paper (the card) shows right around it evenly.
 Preferably, this is a light-colored piece of paper to ensure that your writing will show up on it.


Cut out the rectangle.
Attach it inside the card, again leaving an even border around the edges. This is where you will later write your message.
 Lightly sketch the design you want to create on the front of the card in pencil. As you're designing the card, consider where you want the seed beads to be applied; for example, if you only want beads in certain parts, designate the areas.


If you want to solidly cover an area in beads, it's best to start at the center of each design element, and work your way out.
 Once you're happy with the design, start adding the beads to it, bit by bit.


Squeeze a very thin line of glue over the pencil lines of the design. Cover about an inch (2.5 cm) of its length.
Apply the beads onto the glued area using your fingers. Use the toothpick to help shape or move beads into place as needed. Be sure to have each bead sit on the card with the holes visible from the top.



Work the design in parts or areas, so that you're not dragging your hands over glued areas. Once an area is coated with beads, move on to the next one with the glue, and then the beads.
Continue adjusting any parts of the design as you go; sometimes new design additions will appear to you as you're working on the card.
 Write your message inside and place in an envelope for completion.

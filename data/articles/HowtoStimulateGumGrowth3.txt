 Oil pulling is used to remove impurities from your mouth. Coconut oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, or palm oil can be used. Coconut oil is the most popular, but it is solid below 75 degrees Fahrenheit (23.9 Celsius), and it can be hard to swish around a chunk of oil. Try mixing coconut oil with another one of these oils (e.g. sunflower oil, sesame oil, or palm oil) so it will be easier to swish around your mouth.Children (five to 15 years old) should only use 1 teaspoon of oil.Sesame oil is the preferred oil of choice in Indian culture. Sesame oil is high in antioxidants and is believed to strengthen teeth and gums., Swish and pull the oil between your teeth for 10 to 15 minutes. The oil will turn thin and a milky white color. The swishing motion helps activate enzymes. Do not swallow the oil because it contains bacteria.If you are unable to do 10 to 15 minutes a day, start by doing five minutes and work your way up.
It is best to oil pull first thing in the morning before you eat.
 Once you have spit out the oil, brush your teeth and rinse your mouth with water as you normally would. Oil pulling is not a substitute for regular tooth brushing and oral care. It should be used as a supplement to what you usually do.Oil pulling is as effective as commercially available mouth rinses for reducing bad breath and plaque growth and build up. Gingivitis (early gum disease) is the result of plaque buildup.If you oil pull every day, there should be an improvement in plaque buildup in 10 days.
Although the American Dental Association does not recommend oil pulling,, it has been used for centuries to take care of teeth and gums. Even if you use this technique, see a medical professional to stop your gum recession.

 Your physician will inquire about the history and development of your baby's illness, so make sure to have that information readily available.


This includes the situation surrounding the development of the symptoms.
Certain conditions may help the physician determine whether or not your child has botulism, and how they may have gotten it.
 You should help your pediatrician by trying to soothe your child while the doctor examines him or her.


By this time, the physician will have taken note of any obvious signs or symptoms of infant botulism.
She will check for the aforementioned signs and symptoms such as constipation, drooping eyelids, weak cry, difficulty feeding, and generalized weakness and paralysis.
 To confirm a case of infant botulism, your doctor will order laboratory tests.


Tests can be done on your baby's blood, vomit, or stool.
These tests will reveal the presence of toxins produced by the Clostridium botulinum.
Laboratory results may take more than a day to arrive, and since infant botulism can be fatal when not addressed promptly the doctorâ€™s analysis may serve as the primary basis for early diagnosis.The preferred laboratory test is a stool culture.
However, the baby might be suffering from constipation and in this case, a colonic irrigation or enema will be performed with saline.
Toxin investigation is primarily done with blood as the specimen.
In some cases, to further improve the investigation, dust or soil from clothing, honey, or any suspected source of infection will be taken and examined to identify Clostridium botulism.

 Install the adapter in your operating system. During the boot-up sequence of your computer, keep your eyes open for any messages prompting you to install a third-party SCSI or RAID driver. If you see it, then you will need to press F6 to initiate the installation process. In this case, you will be prompted to insert the floppy disk that came with your adapter, as this disk holds all of the third-party drivers.

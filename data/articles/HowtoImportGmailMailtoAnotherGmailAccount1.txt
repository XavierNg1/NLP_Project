 Under "Check mail from other accounts (using POP3)", click "Add a POP3 mail account you own".;
, You can enter a @gmail.com address or any other email address that you own. Click Next.
 Enable the settings “Leave a copy of retrieved messages on the server” and “Label incoming messages” to easily identify emails fetched from the old address.


If you have turned-on 2-factor authentication for your old Gmail address, you may have to generate a app-specific password that you can generate from your Google Account’s security page.
 The process may take some time, depending on the size of your mailbox.

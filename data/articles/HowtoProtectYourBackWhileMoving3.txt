 Stick with athletic shoes or sneakers. Avoid flip flops and anything with a heel.



Sit down whenever you can, with your feet flat on the ground. When you are standing for a long period of time, put one foot up on a stool or raised surface to alleviate pressure on the back.



Buy a lumbar support belt or a full back brace from your chiropractor or other retailers. Try a few on to make sure you get one that fits properly and offers the necessary support.

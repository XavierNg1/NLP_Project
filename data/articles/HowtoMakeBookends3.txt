 Draw the shape of your quotation marks on your poster board and cut them out with scissors. Create your edges by cutting two inch strips from your poster board. Shape the molds and make sure there are no holes or the plaster may get through.Create the size to your preference. You can make them as large or small as youâ€™d like depending on your bookcase. Use the slick side of white or dry erase poster board so that the plaster can be easily removed.
 Read the packaging of your plaster to know how much water to add to your mixture. Pour the plaster and water into a mixing bowl and use a spoon to stir the mixture. Be careful as the plaster heats up as you stir.Be sure to use a bowl and spoon that you will not be using for food. You may not be able to remove the plaster once you have used these items.
 Check the instructions on your plaster for drying times. You may have to wait 30 minutes or longer before removing your plaster from the mold and then waiting another 24 hours for the plaster to dry.If some of the poster board sticks to the mold, use an exacto knife to gently scrape or sand it off once fully dry, or paint over it later.
 Cut some scrap wood to the size of your quotation marks and glue or nail them together at a perpendicular angle to create the base and back. Nail or glue your quotation marks onto the scrap wood base and back.Use wood clamps when using glue as the glue dries. You may also paint the base and back. Paint them the same colour as your bookshelf to make your quotation marks seem as if they were floating.
 Paint your quotation marks a contrasting colour to the base and back to help them stand out. Be sure to sand both the plaster quotation marks and wooden base and back before painting them. Consult the paint packaging for proper drying times.Let your plaster dry for a few days. The paint may end up peeling off if you do not allow your plaster to dry. If this happens, sand off the paint and paint over it again.

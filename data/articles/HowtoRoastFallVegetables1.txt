 Turn on the oven to 425 degrees F (218 C). Set two heavy baking sheets near your work space. Although you don't need to butter or grease the sheets, you may want to lay down foil for easier clean up.Since many fall vegetables take a while to roast, use heavy baking sheets so the heat is distributed evenly. This way, your pan won't warp or pop once you've placed it in the hot oven.;
, Wash your fall vegetables before you peel them. Take a sharp kitchen knife with a large blade (like a chef's knife) and carefully cut all the vegetables into cubes. The cubes should all be similar in size, about an inch to 1 1/4 inch. Avoid dicing the vegetables. If the vegetables are too small, they're more likely to shrink and burn as they roast. You'll need to peel and chop:1 pound (450 g) of carrots
1 pound (453 g) of parsnips
1 large (230 g) sweet potato
1 small butternut squash (about 2 pounds or 900 g) with the seeds removed

, Spread the cut vegetables on the two baking sheets. The vegetables should be mixed and they need to be in a single layer so they roast evenly. Drizzle 3 tablespoons of olive oil over the two sheets of vegetables. Sprinkle the vegetables with 1 1/2 teaspoons of kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper. Toss the vegetables to coat them.You can easily halve this recipe by using half of the ingredients and roasting enough vegetables to fill one of the baking sheets.
 Place the pans in the preheated oven and bake the vegetables for 25 to 35 minutes. To make sure that all the sides are evenly roasted, turn the vegetables with a spatula halfway through the cooking time. The fall vegetables will be done when the're all tender and golden brown.Sprinkle the roasted vegetables with 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley before serving.

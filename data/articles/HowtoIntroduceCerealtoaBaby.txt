 Before your baby advances from a straight milk diet to foods, ask your baby's pediatrician or dietitian for approval to start. These are clues to see if your baby is ready.
Positioning: keeping their head up and sitting with little or no support. A helpful tip is to use highchairs, including restaurant ones, and stuff blankets around the baby to help position themselves.



 


Mouth actions: a baby doesn't need to start teething before starting foods, but they may be pre-teething though. They may also start grabbing everything in their reach and pulling it to their mouths or constantly sucking on their fingers. A good clue is when they start to gnaw, not just suck, on things.






Food interest: they may see your table food and stare at it as if they want it and may bring their hands and arms out to reach for something.






Weight gain: doubling their birth weight is a plus in starting foods.;
, The first cereal feeding should be very runny or liquidity. Measure 1 tablespoon of cereal and mix it with 4 to 5 tablespoons of formula or breast milk. Never use cow's milk for small babies.
 Scoop a very small amount of cereal with a spoon and place it around their mouth & nose. Let them smell and lap the spoon with their tongues. You can also "shovel" or "scoop" up any dribble around the mouth and chin and place it back into the mouth. Make it interesting for them; distract them with the television or make sounds as you're feeding them.
 When the baby accepts cereal, try to see if they'll accept their meal if you increase the cereal amount or decrease the formula/breast milk amount.


When they begin fruits and vegetables, you may scoop mashed bananas and add them to their cereal.
 If the baby has no interest, seems full, or doesn't accept it, stop with the feeding. Discard any leftovers immediately.

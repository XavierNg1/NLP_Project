 There are blood tests that can show whether you have or have previously had H. pylori. Though they can be a useful diagnostic tool, other tests are typically more accurate for H. pylori. In any case, if you have a blood test, and your doctor thinks you might have or have had H. pylori, she might follow it up with a breath or stool test.You could get the results by the next day.One advantage of the blood test is that its results won't be affected by a recent course of antibiotics., If you have this test, you’ll give a stool sample to the lab. They’ll look for H. Pylori antigens. This test is more accurate than the blood test. Pepto-bismol and other drugs can interfere with this test.Your doctor will provide you with a plastic stool collection container. Make sure you follow all of the instructions accompanying the container.You will need to collect at least 20mm or 5 grams of stool for this test.Keep the stool sample refrigerated if you are going to return to the doctor within 72 hours. If not, freeze it., In this test you’ll swallow something that has carbon molecules.This could be a pudding or a pill. You’ll then breath into a bag, and your doctor will check for carbon molecules. Certain drugs such as Pepto-Bismol and antibiotics can interfere with the accuracy of this test. You may have to discontinue taking them a week or so before the test.You'll first breath into a bag, consume the carbon-containing molecules, and then wait 15 minutes. After that time, you'll be asked to breath into the bag again.

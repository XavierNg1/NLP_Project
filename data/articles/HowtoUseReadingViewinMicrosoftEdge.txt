Click a news article you'd like to read from the Edge home page.
Click the URL bar at the top of the Edge window, then type in a site's name or web address and press â†µ Enter.

 Once you finish your article, you can click the Reading View icon (or the Edge "Back" button in the top-left corner of the screen) to close out of Reading View.

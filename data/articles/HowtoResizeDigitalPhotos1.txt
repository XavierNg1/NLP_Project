 There are many web services that will resize your images for free. You will need to upload your image to the site and then choose your resize options. Most programs offer the same basic features, though some will have extras available that others don’t. Several of the more popular sites include:


picresize
Resize Your Image
Shrink Pictures
Web Resizer
Resize Pic;
, You will have to navigate to the image on your computer, and then upload it to the website. Once the upload is complete, the image editing options will appear.


Most web applications have a maximum file size that is allowed to be uploaded, typically around 5 MB.
 Depending on which service you are using, you may have multiple options when it comes to resizing. You may be able to choose a percentage of the original size, or several preset size. Almost all services will allow you to set an exact size in pixels that you would like to resize to.
 Most resize services will let you set how much compression the image will have, which will affect the quality. The higher the compression, the lower the quality and the smaller the file size.
 Depending on the service you are using, you may have access to other options such as rotation, color changes, filters, and more. Choose the effects that you want.
 Once you’ve picked all of your settings and effects, click the Download button. This may be called a Resize button or something similar. The newly-edited photo will be downloaded to your computer, which you can then transfer to wherever you need.

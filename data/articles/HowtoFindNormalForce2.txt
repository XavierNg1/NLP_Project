 To calculate the normal force of an object at an angle, you need to use the formula: N = m * g * cos(x)For this equation, N refers to the normal force, m refers to the object's mass, g refers to the acceleration of gravity, and x refers to the angle of incline.

Example: Find the normal force of a block with a mass of 4.2 kg, sitting on a ramp with an incline of 45 degrees.
 The cosign of an angle equals the sine of the complementary angle, or the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the incline.This value is often determined by a calculator, since the cosine of any angle is constant to that angle, but you can compute it manually, as well.

Example: cos (45) = 0.71

, The weight of an object equals the mass of the object multiplied by the acceleration of gravity.


Note that the gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface is a constant: g = 9.8 m/s2


Example: weight = m * g = 4.2 * 9.8 = 41.16

, In order to find the normal force, you need to multiply the weight of the object by the cosine of the angle of incline.



Example: N = m * g * cos(x) = 41.16 * 0.71 = 29.1

, The previous step should complete the problem and give you your answer.


Note that for an object sitting on an incline, the normal force should be less than the weight of the object.

Example: The normal force is 29.1 N.

 After you've registered on Moloyo as a user, your profile sidebar provides a link to become a verified seller.;
,, To start a new auction, simply click the link in your profile's sidebar. You will be guided through the auction listing process which only takes a few minutes.


Sellers are given the opportunity to put a reserve on their auction item. If the item doesn't reach that reserve, the item doesn't sell, and all the bids spent by bidders are returned. It's only once a reserve has been met or surpassed that the item will actually sell at auction.
Our reserve calculator takes your reserve and determines the Moloyo reserve of that item.
 Once you sell an item, you will be notified via your email as well as a notification on your profile page. Take the time to talk to the winning bidder, make sure you two are in agreement with the final price.
 You will be notified when you have been paid by the winning bidder by both Moloyo and PayPal. Once payment is received, Moloyo will deposit the bid money the seller earned on their item. It's up to the seller to send the item. If an issue arises, the seller risks action from both PayPal and Moloyo.
 Leaving feedback is very important. It's the perfect way to let the community know how the user handled the transaction.

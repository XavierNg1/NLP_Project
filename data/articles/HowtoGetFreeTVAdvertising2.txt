 Choose an event that gets TV publicity every year. Pay money to help put on the event, if the event promises to post your business name and logo on printed materials and announces it on television and radio.


You may also choose to align yourself with a charity event. This promotes good causes and can often be tax deductible for your company. At the same time, your business name can appear in conjunction with the positive event.
Your company may also allocate resources or expertise instead of money to an event, in return for a sponsorship credit. Creating a relationship with a yearly event may allow you to have yearly, pre-arranged sponsorship advertising.

 If the light was recently on, wait until it is cool to the touch. This shouldn't take more than five minutes for a normal light bulb. Halogen lights may take twenty minutes., The strip should be about 12 inches (30 cm) long, or half as long as your arm.
 Fold a short section of the duct tape over and stick it to itself. Repeat on the other side. These folded "handles" should be long enough for you to grip, with a sticky segment in between them.








If you find it easier, you can wrap the duct tape in a circle instead, with the adhesive on the outside. Make the circle large enough to fit your hand through it.
 Hold the handles of the duct tape and press the sticky segment against the flat surface of the recessed bulb.
 Once the tape sticks to the light bulb, you should have enough leverage to get it loose. Almost all light bulbs use standard screw threading, so turn the bulb counterclockwise to unscrew it.









If it doesn't budge, read the method below for help removing the surrounding collar.
 Once the light bulb has emerged enough for you to grip the sides, pull off the duct tape. It's faster at this point to spin the bulb out by hand.
 Screw in the new light bulb as far as you can by hand. When it's nearly flush, stick on the duct tape and turn clockwise to tighten to a secure fit.

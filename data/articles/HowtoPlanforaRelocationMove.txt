 Are You Sure You Want To Move? Many people want to move for the sake of moving.  But they don't often take into account all of the things that make a relocation a good one.  If it's a relocation due to a new job, make sure you look at the opportunity costs.;
, Do You Know All the Costs? This includes everything from the costs of the actual move to what it will cost at your new home.  Not just cost of living but things like property taxes, state and local taxes and more.  Don't be surprised.
 A relocation can be a big change for a family.  Get input early and include family members in the decision making process. It can make it go much more smoothly.
 Unless you are moving someplace your have lived before - try to take a couple trips to your new home.  Learn about the area and the neighborhoods and resources the area has to offer.  Its important to have a working knowledge of where you will be - rely on an employer or support network to help.
 In our connected world you can usually get most things quickly.  But some records - like health care records for chronic conditions or prescriptions - should be records you have easy access to at all times.
 Start a couple months out if possible and work from a moving plan.  Have a strategy of what gets moved, how and when.  If you are using movers, get referrals and multiple quotes - they can vary significantly.
 Selling your home during a relocation can be challenging and stressful.  Plan ahead if you are going to need to sell your home to buy a new one where you are moving.  Timing is critical.  Consider a home buyer who can buy your home quickly for cash instead of a traditional broker.
 Its important to thank those who helped with the relocation and create closure with some relationships (especially with young children).
 There will be lots to do once you move to your new home.  If possible, build in some time to adjust and get things done around your new home.

 The first step in preparing powdered silkworm chow is to add water. You'll want to make sure that you use the right ratios of water and powder to achieve an ideal consistency.Some experts recommend a ratio of one part silkworm chow to two parts water.
One pound (453.6 grams) of prepared chow should be sufficient to raise 20 to 25 silkworms through a complete life cycle.You can scale your mix preparations up or down as needed.
Use hot water to facilitate a better mix.
Mix the powder and water for approximately three to five minutes to ensure that they are thoroughly blended together.
 Heating the mixture will help form a more solid chow patty.It can also help kill any bacteria or mold that may have formed in the chow mix.


Cover the container with plastic wrap. This will help seal in moisture and heat the mixture more efficiently.
Microwave the mixture for three to eight minutes, depending on the strength of your microwave.
 The heated chow patty should be left in the refrigerator until it hardens to a cream cheese-like consistency. Make sure the mixture is not too watery, as watery chow could potentially drown your silkworms.The exact duration of time it takes to harden will vary, depending on your refrigerator and the consistency of your chow.
 Once the chow has hardened, it can be cut and served to your silkworms.You can also use a cheese grater to shave the hardened chow and distribute it more evenly.

 Try to form a steady beat for every individual sound you make.For example, ba (clap) - na (clap) -na (clap). This word has three claps, one for every syllable.
Words have a natural emphasis when you say them regularly. The word "banana" sounds like banana because it stresses the middle syllable. Coordinate your claps with the natural stresses and emphases of a word.
Start with bigger words that you know have more than one syllable, like "hippopotamus." The more syllables there are, the longer and more rhythmic your beat will be, making it easier to divide the word.
 Say a part of the word every time you hear a "click" noise.


Try to be silent at the same times the metronome or Newton's cradle is silent. Only say a syllable when you hear a click sound. This will help you split up a word into its smallest audible segments.
This might be easier than clapping because your focus is mostly on saying words and not so much on creating a rhythm. You can also use your hands to tally the syllables in particularly long words.
If using a metronome, pick a fast but steady tempo. Most hit songs fall into the 120 beats-per-minute (BPM) range,suggesting that maybe most people appreciate sound at this speed. Try setting your tempo to 120 bpm and saying words on tempo.

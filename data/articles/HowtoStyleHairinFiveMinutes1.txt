 To get your hair perfect in such a small amount of time, we need to get your bed head tamed and neat.



Straight Hair: Take out a brush that works best for your hair, and combs very easily. Brush all of the knots out, and use a detangler if needed. Make sure your hair is neat and not extremely frizzy and knotty.

Wavy/Curly Hair: Use a comb or brush to take out all the knots, and use detangler if needed. You can scrunch your curls using scrunching hair products. If you do not have these products on hand, you can simply use your bare hands to scrunch your hair.

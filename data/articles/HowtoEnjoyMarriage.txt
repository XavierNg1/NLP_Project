 Always allow room for each other to breathe, to make mistakes and to grow. Never smother someone.;
, Even in a marriage, it is important to encourage your partner through thick and thin. Even if your partner comes to you with the worst idea you have ever heard, be supportive. Most ideas will not come to fruition but the support you provide will always be remembered.
 Just because you have been married for a period of time, no matter how long, always consider your partner's feelings and be tactful, always. Never be overcritical.


Instead of criticizing your partner's distasteful habits, hint to them how much you like it when they do the opposite. Do this in a genuinely kind manner.
 Try discovering SCUBA classes, rock climbing, a parachuting experience. The sheer thrill of learning something new creates a positive mood boost and gives you a shared experience.
 Never take yourself too seriously.

 The quadratic formula is as follows: the opposite of b plus or minus the square root of b^2-4ac, all over 2a.
 There's no math involved in this step. It's purely for setting things up so that you can factor easier when the time comes. Think of your equation as having a format. The format of the equation is ax2 ± bx ± c = 0. Simply find out the a, b, and c values in your equation.
 You already know the numbers, and you have the quadratic formula right in front of you. Just plug in the a value whenever you see the a in the quadratic equation, and so on for the "bs" and "cs".
 In order to solve the quadratic formula, you need to know how to divide, how to solve square roots, and how to work with fractions. Everything else is simple plug-and-chug.


Another variant of solving the quadratic equation is completing the square. Some people find this easier than solving a whole quadratic formula.
 Because of the square root will turn into a ± number (i.e. ±5), you'll have two different fractions. Both fractions, simplified, will be the answers to your function.

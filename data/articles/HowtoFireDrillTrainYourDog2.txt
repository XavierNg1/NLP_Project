 Your behavior will set the tone for your household and its pets. Dogs are especially susceptible to catching your panic, which can make them act erratically and put them in harm’s way. Strive to maintain a calm voice and manner, even if you’re feeling stressed and fearful., Before a fire takes place, assign one member of your household to look after your pet. That way, you can be sure to account for your dog while avoiding any confusion that could delay your evacuation.This should also be the person who runs the fire drill training with your dog.
 If you’re forced to exit your burning house without your dog, be sure to keep the door you left through open. Then, call back to them from outside it.Remember to grab your dog’s extra leash by the door as you exit.
If you’ve run the fire drill enough times, your dog should know to listen for your voice at an exit when they hear the smoke alarm go off.
If you left through a door that your dog does not normally exit the house through, be sure to also open their regular exit.
 Before an emergency occurs, take time to notice where your pet goes when they are feeling anxious or stressed. If you cannot find your pet during a fire alarm, check those spots if they’re safely accessible.If they’re not safely accessible, notify the rescue workers of where your pet might be.
 Once your dog is outside, be sure that they are secured. Either store them in a locked crate or carrier out of harm’s way or have them on a leash and make sure that someone in your household is responsible for holding your pet.If you prefer the crate or carrier option, be sure that you store one near an accessible exterior door, for instance in a mud room or your garage.

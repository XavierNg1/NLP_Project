 Mix ½ ounce (15 ml) of bacon-flavored vodka, 4 ounces (118 ml) of tomato juice, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of Worcestershire sauce, 1 to 2 dashes of cayenne pepper sauce, the juice from half a lemon, and ½ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of dried ground horseradish to a cocktail shaker. Close it, and shake the mixture for 15 to 20 seconds until all of the ingredients are thoroughly combined.If you don’t have a cocktail mixer, use a large glass jar with a lid to mix the cocktail.
 Once the cocktail is fully mixed, fill a glass with ice. Add the mixture to the glass until it is full.If you like, you can wet the rim of the glass before filling it and dip it in a mixture of salt and freshly ground black pepper to garnish it.
 After you’ve poured the cocktail into the glass, stick a slice of cooked, crisp bacon and a stalk of celery in it as garnish. If you like, you can also add some pickled vegetables, such as onions or olives to the garnish.

 As an Electric-type, Flaaffy can deal heavy damage against Water- and Flying-type Pokémon. It won’t have any trouble defeating Pokémon of these types even if their level is a bit higher.


On the other hand, Flaaffy is extremely weak against Electric, Grass, Dragon, or Ground-types. It will deal either a very low or no damage at all to these types and will take twice the normal damage if attacked by a Ground-type move.;
, Flaaffy evolves into its final evolution stage, Ampharos, when its level reaches 30. So until then, make Flaaffy earn experience points (XP) through Pokémon battles. To easily gain XP, you can do the following:


Fight wild Water and Flying-type Pokémon that have higher levels than Flaaffy. As mentioned, Flaaffy deals severe damage to these types, so it won’t have any trouble beating these kinds of opponent even if they’re a few levels higher. Pokémon with higher levels give off more XP when you defeat them.
Fight Pokémon trainers. Trained Pokémon gives more XP points when beaten compared to wild Pokémon.
 Even though it is an electric type, you can’t use a Thunderstone to forcibly evolve Flaaffy. It will naturally turn into Ampharos when it reaches the right level.


There are only a few Pokémon that can evolve using a Thunderstone and Flaaffy isn’t one of them.

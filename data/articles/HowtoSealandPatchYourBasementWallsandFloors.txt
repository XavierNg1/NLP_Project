 This will get your basement walls and floor ready for application of your coating. With the two-part water base epoxy coating that I use, an application over a damp surface helps the first coat penetrate into the concrete for a deep bond.;
, The material will seep into the porous concrete like a first coat of paint would. I like to apply with 1/2" or 3/8" nap rollers for a nice, thick coat that is applied at a rate of 125 to 150 square feet per gallon on walls and 175 to 200 square feet per gallon on floors.
, I find that using hydraulic cement is only a temporary patch because the material is so brittle. Concrete by itself is worse. I use the two-part epoxy coating mixed with Sand Mix or Portland Cement and sand mixed with the epoxy for all crack-filling, unless it is actively leaking. Also, I prefer to patch the walls after applying my first coat of the epoxy coating, which acts a primer for patching. I then apply my second coat for a beautifully painted surface. A great trick for the cold joint or floor joint is to use the back of a spoon for a nice smooth cove. This method forces the mortar deep into the joint, the polymer in the mix allowing some flexibility and movement.
, They can be dangerous to work with in tight areas.
 Now what are you going to do?

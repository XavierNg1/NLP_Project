 A practice test allows you to see the types of questions that are asked and the structure of the test. If you score much higher on one of the tests or prefer one test over the other, focus on that test. It is better to prep for one test instead of trying to prep for both of them.Make sure you take an official practice test. You can find them at the ACT and SAT websites.

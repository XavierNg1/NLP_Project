 This may seem like a no-brainer, but when you're trying to send a check abroad, even the smallest error in date, amount, or payee can cause complications. Follow all of the standards correctly to make sure no unforeseen circumstances prevent the check from being cashed.


There aren't any notes or differences you'll need to make for the check to be cashed and accepted by a standard Canadian bank.;
, Although your personal check will work just fine, a certified check can be issued by your bank. These are as good as cash and directly drafted and backed by the bank. These are useful when the person receiving the money wants a guarantee that the money is covered by a person they are not entirely familiar with. This may cost a small fee, but generally if you have an account at the bank, it should not cost any processing fee but each bank can differ., Every USD is worth approximately 1.31 Canadian dollars, but this rate can fluctuate. For example, $20 USD would be $26.18 CAD. Therefore, if the person or organization you're writing the check to is expecting a certain amount in Canadian dollars, make sure the amount is correct.


Note the currency you're using. The currency of the check is based on the bank that it is drawn from. If the funds are drawn from a U.S. bank, the funds are denoted in U.S. dollars (USD). If the funds are drawn from a Canadian bank, they are based in Canadian dollars (CAD).

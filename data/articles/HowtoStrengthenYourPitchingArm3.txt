 Research suggests that approximately 50% of ball velocity comes from the force you accumulate in your stride.In order to produce maximum velocity, you must increase your stride speed and length.This will help you build your forward momentum and generate an improved pitching velocity.


To gain speed and stride length, work on moving your body as fast as possible in a side lunge, going from your back leg to your front leg without stopping or hesitating.
Strive for the longest stride possible while still managing to get your head and shoulders positioned over your lead leg when you release the ball.Increase your knee flexion when your foot hits the ground after your stride. The more your front knee is bent after your foot hits the ground, the higher your velocity will be.
 Your lower body (feet, legs, and hips) is directly responsible for the building of momentum in the delivery.By starting your delivery with well-practiced foot movement and leg lifting, you generate your pitch velocity from the ground up, which in turn generates the force needed to propel the ball.This momentum builder is referred to in the industry as the tempo of the delivery.
 Not only will stretching increase your flexibility, but it will also reduce your recovery time after training sessions.


Use foam rolls, dynamic stretching, and static stretching to increase your flexibility.
 When utilized correctly, weighted balls will definitely increase your velocity. This type of training is called “overload” training and should never be employed during the regular season. Use weighted balls correctly and responsibly, combined with a proper long toss regimen, for best results.


Weighted balls should only be used by pitchers that are high school age and up.
 As long as you are observing proper pitch mechanics, feel free to use a style that is natural and comfortable for you. Marrying these two principles will only serve to increase your velocity.

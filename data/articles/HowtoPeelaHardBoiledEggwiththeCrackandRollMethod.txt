 The bowl should be large enough to hold all the eggs but also allow the eggs to be covered completely by the water.


Consider using a Tupperware container instead of a bowl so you can top it with a lid for easy storage in the refrigerator.;
, Make sure all the eggs fit underneath the water.
 You want the water to soak the hard shell, which will allow it to move away from the egg membrane.


For best results, place bowl in refrigerator while eggs soak.
 You donâ€™t have to dry it completely but just remove excess water so it doesn't slip from your fingers.
 Eggshell should be slightly cracked but not broken.
 Perform this motion once or twice.
 Shell should come apart in one or two clean pieces. Egg should be moist.

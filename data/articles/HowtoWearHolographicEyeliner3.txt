 Look for holographic paper in metallic shades that reflect light, like silver and gold. Any color can be holographic as long as it reflects light like metal. Purchase the thinnest paper you can get your hands on, because you’ll be gluing it to your skin., Get an idea of how wide you need to cut your holographic paper by measuring your upper eyelid first. Hold a ruler up to the corner of one eye and note the length where your outer lid ends.
 You will need to cut a small piece of holographic paper out to paste on your upper lid. Trace an arch a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) smaller than what you measured that is thin on one end and that arches up to about 1⁄4 inch (0.64 cm) thick.
 Use small scissors to cut out what you traced. Flip your paper over and lay this arch on top to trace another one. Cut out this matching arch for your opposite eye.
 Use eyelash glue to adhere the cut pieces of holographic paper to your upper eyelids. Check their placement before you start gluing. The paper should start at the beginning of your top arch and extend 1⁄2 to 1⁄4 inch (1.27 to 0.64 cm) past your outer lid.


Place three small dots of glue on the backside of each paper arch. Spread the glue out and wait 30 seconds before you smooth the paper over your upper lashline.

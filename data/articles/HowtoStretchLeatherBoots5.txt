 In general, you will want a boot stretcher to stretch the foot of the boot and a calf stretcher to stretch the calf portion of the boot.


The difference between a boot stretcher and a shoe stretcher is that a boot stretcher has a long handle sticking up, allowing you to access the stretching mechanism in spite of the boot's tall sides.
If your leather boots are ankle height, you can probably manage to stretch the foot with a shoe stretcher instead of a boot stretcher.
 Carefully position the wooden wedge of the boot stretcher device into the foot of the boot.


Make sure that the long handle sticks up and out of the boot. You will need to be able to reach the handle and turn it without difficulty.
 Turn the handle to open the wedge up. The screw device should push open the wedge, stretching out the toe area in the process.


Let the leather sit in this position for several minutes before returning the wedge to its original size and removing it from the boot.
 Pull the boot over the calf stretcher so that the entire calf portion fits on.


Stop directly above the ankle of the boot to avoid damaging or distorting the foot of the boot.
 Turn the crank at the top of the device to open up the wedge. Open the wedge as far as it will go to stretch the boots as much as possible.


Let the boots sit on the calf stretcher for several minutes to maximize the effect.

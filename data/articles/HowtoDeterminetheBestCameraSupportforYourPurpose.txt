 Are you going to be shooting landscapes? Portraits, pets, trick photography. They all have different requirements.



Portraiture: Tripod with a ball head is the best choice

Landscape: Tripod with a pano head

Hiking: Light weight tripod and/or a monopod

Trick Photography: Tripod, Bean bag tripod, any piece of furniture in the area (anything goes)

Macro photography: Table top tripod, bean bag tripod, a convenient box or book, etc. There are also types of tripods that you can wrap around a pole or sit on a table, and so on.

Long exposure photography: The most solid tripod you can find;
, If you are shooting wildlife, and you have a very long lens, it will need a T-mount for your lens and the tripod. The tripod will be supporting your lens, not your actual camera.
 There is almost always an alternative method that could serve your purposes. Obviously, if you are going to be doing any type of photography regularly, you will want to have the appropriate camera support.

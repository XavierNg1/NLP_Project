 The Chicago Manual of Style mandates the use of footnotes when citing sources in the text. You'll have an entry for your source on the footnote and another entry in the bibliography.To insert a footnote, click at the end of the sentence where you are making a citation. The footnote number will come directly after the period. Under "References" in Microsoft Word, click "Insert Footnote." It will create a footnote number behind the sentence and a corresponding footnote at the bottom of the page.
 Cite your website in a footnote as follows:


1. Author's First Name Author's Last Name, "The Webpage Title," the publisher, organization, or website name, publication date or access date, URL or DOI.It should look something like this citation: 1. Jess Smith, "Cherry Pie for Beginners," Pies for Everyone, 2005, www.piesforeveryone.com.
The DOI is the digital object identifier. It is a unique number assigned to online articles, so people can find them, much like an ISBN number. However, it's usually only assigned to academic articles. You can search for an article's DOI on Crossref.org.If you don't know the publication date, add "accessed" in front of the year in the footnote and "Accessed" in front of the year in the final citation.If the author is unknown, begin with the first piece of information in the citation you have., Complete the entry in the bibliography for the website. It is essentially the same information as the main entry, but you change some of the commas to periods and reverse the author's name.


Author's Last Name, Author's First Name. "Title of Webpage." Lastname, Firstname. “Title of Web Page.” the publisher, organization, or website name. publication date or access date. URL or DOI.
For example, it looks like the following citation: Smith, Jess. "Cherry Pie for Beginners." 'Pies for Everyone.' 2005. www.piesforeveryone.com.
 Use the first word in each citation to put the list in alphabetical order.

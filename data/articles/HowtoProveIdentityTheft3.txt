 You may first discover that your identity has been stolen when the IRS sends you a notice that you owe money or that more than one tax return was filed in your name. Do not delay; call the number listed on the IRS notice, and fill out an Identity Theft Affidavit Form 14039, available at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf., The IRS will issue you an Identity Protection PIN, which you will need to enter when you file your tax return. The PIN will prove your identity and prevent thieves from filing returns under your name. The IRS will send you your PIN in a letter. Keep it in a safe place until tax season., Contact your local law enforcement authorities to file a police report.You can use the report to document the theft to the IRS and to creditors, banks, police, and courts. When you go to the police station, bring the following with you:


Government-issued photographic ID (such as a state ID card or driver's license);
Proof of your home address (like a utility bill or rent agreement);
The notice you received from the IRS; and
A copy of the FTC's "Memo to Law Enforcement," available at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/articles/pdf/pdf-0088-ftc-memo-law-enforcement.pdf.

 A rigid and outdated business model can spell disaster at any time, but especially during a recession. An economic downturn is the perfect time to find out how new technology can make your product or service less expensive or more efficient. Also, updating your practices, services and products can bring you a new customer base, even during a recession.For example, in the publishing industry, the trend is moving away from print publications in favor of online publications. Traditional newspaper and magazine franchises have had to embrace digital media subscriptions and online advertising in order to continue to attract customers.
 Part of what helped some businesses remain profitable during the recession was the ability to create new revenue streams from an online presence. Businesses are learning that the process of creating and optimizing a website is not as time-consuming and costly as it once was. Making the financial commitment to creating an online storefront for your business connects you to a whole new customer base. If you are not doing this, you could be leaving money on the table., Owning and operating a small business requires a huge investment, not only of your finances but also of your time. A passive income stream, on the other hand, is something that can allow you to earn money even though youâ€™re not directly working on it. This can provide you with a reliable income that can tide you over while you invest time and money to keep your businesses afloat.For example, look into dividend investment. This means taking the dividends you earn on investments and re-investing them to grow your investment even further. This practice can not only boost personal wealth, but it can also support your commercial endeavors.

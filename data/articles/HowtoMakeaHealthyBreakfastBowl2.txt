Once melted, stir in the vanilla, mashed banana, and lemon zest.When the mixture is consistent throughout, turn off the heat and remove the pan from the burner., You may first want to allow the ingredients to cool to prevent accidental burns and make the mixture easier to handle. Pour the mixture from the pan over the ingredients in the baking sheet. Then sprinkle the sheet with salt.

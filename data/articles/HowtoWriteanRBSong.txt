 Do you want a nice club type song, a more pop like melody, or a nice sexy slow jam.;
, Are you more interested in a club banger, a nice pop type song, maybe a soul or gospel crossover, or some hip-hop influences to it. You can also try crossing country or jazz.
 This usually gets the ball rolling. You can add a little glimpse of the chorus in the intro, especially you are making a pop influenced song. It will be nice if you use a synth pad for the chord progression, unless it is a club hit, then you use a rhythmic synth lead sound. In rhythmic tracks, synth pad could be used in chorus and bridge.
 Try to keep the bass and drum with the tempo, mood, and style. You can add more intricate rhythmic and melodic effects later, but don't mess with the bass.
 If it is soul influence, try adding some brass and some gospel organ. If it is a more club influence, try having a more bouncy hip-hop effect to it with some more modern drum effects and synth leads. If it is pop influence, try adding some synthetic effect and corporate sounding pop elements and pop song structure.
 Try to get something that sums up the idea of the song and think of a melody that sticks in the head.
 Try to make the instrumental minimalist and not as intricate as the chorus or bridge, to allow vocal effects. The second verse can add some layers for variation.
, A bridge might be a great time to add a rap, take away the drums, or add intricate harmonies and chord progressions.

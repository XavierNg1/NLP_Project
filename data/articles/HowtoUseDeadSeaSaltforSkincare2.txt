 You can purchase Dead Sea salt online at various retailers or at places like Walmart or Target. In order to make the Dead Sea salt scrub, you will also need to purchase a “carrier oil.” This is a matter of personal preference. You can use coconut oil, olive oil, almond oil, avocado oil, or truly any other oil you find that you enjoy. For one cup (about 272 grams) of Dead Sea salt, you will need 1/3 to 1/2 cup (79–118 mL) of oil., Pour your salt into a mixing bowl first. Then, slowly begin adding the oil. As you add the oil, stir your salt with a metal spoon. Continue adding oil until you’ve reached a consistency you like. You can also add a few drops of a fragrance oil or essential oil, if you desire., This recipe will create more salt scrub than you need for one shower, so you’ll be able to save the rest of it. Put it in a mason jar or a plastic Tupperware container – anything with a lid. Store it somewhere that it won’t experience any extreme temperatures.Your Dead Sea salt scrub should last as long as you don’t get water into it during your shower. That can cause bacterial growth in your product.
 First, rinse your body in the shower. When you are ready to use the scrub, turn your water off. Use a spoon to take the scrub from the container without dripping water into it. Scrub it into your skin using circular motions, working your way from your feet to your neck.Allow your salt scrub to sit on your skin for a couple of minutes before rinsing. This will allow your skin to really absorb the product and get the maximum hydrating benefits.
Do not use this scrub on your face. While it is a great exfoliator for the skin of your body, it may cause irritation to your more delicate facial skin.

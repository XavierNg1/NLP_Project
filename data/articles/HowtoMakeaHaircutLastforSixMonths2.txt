 Shampooing can dry out your hair, leading to damaged hair. If you want your haircut to last, you need to reduce damage as much as possible, so try shampooing just a couple of times a week.In addition, shampooing less will keep you from doing other damaging steps as often (such as heat styling)., Dyeing can be very damaging to your hair, particularly if you do it frequently. Therefore, you need to skip dyeing if at all possible to keep your haircut looking nice for longer periods of time.If you do decide to dye your hair, keep in mind that permanent dyes are generally more damaging than semi-permanent, but you need to apply semi-permanent more often.Natural hair dyes tend to have fewer chemicals, so they may be less damaging., You may find this step a bit more difficult than skipping dyeing. However, heat styling your hair, including using curling irons, flat irons, and blow dryers, can cause extensive damage to your hair over time. To extend the life of your haircut, try to avoid these styling techniques as much as possible., Deep conditioning rejuvenates your hair and keeps it looking nice between cuts. You can try a store-bought product for deep conditioning. You'll usually leave it in your hair for half an hour or so before washing it out. However, you can also just use coconut oil or olive oil by rubbing it in, focusing on the ends. Leave it in for about 15 to 30 minutes before rinsing it out in the shower.Some people even just dab on a bit of coconut oil near the ends right before hopping in the shower. The oil helps protect the ends., If you're going a long time between cuts, generally your biggest concern is split ends. You can take care of those at home, as long as you do it very carefully. The easiest method is to take a curl of hair and twist it. Use your other hand to sweep along it, dislodging split ends. You can snip off hairs that are looking split with sharp scissors.

 Tor is a network that allows you to browse the internet anonymously, and can bypass most blocks and filters. You can download the Tor browser for free from torproject.org.


If the Tor website is blocked on your computer, you can download it on another computer and install it to a USB drive.
 Follow the prompts to install the browser on your computer. If you want to install it on a USB drive, select the drive as the installation location.
 This will configure Tor for first-time use.
 You should see the "Congratulations!" page after successfully connecting to the Tor network, and you can start browsing blocked websites.


When you want to run Tor again, start the Tor browser. You won't need to go through the initial setup process.

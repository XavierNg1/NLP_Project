 One of the most common signs of dental disease in dogs is bad breath or “doggy breath.” Your dog should not have bad breath. Bad breath can mean an infection of the gums or teeth. Bacteria from tartar build up can also cause an odor.If your dog has a healthy mouth, their breath will not smell.;
, Any kind of substance buildup on your dog’s teeth is not normal. Look along the gum line for any kind of hard buildup. If the teeth has yellow-brownish crust along the gums, your dog has tartar.If there is a thick dark brownish crust near the gums, your dog’s teeth has calculus, which is a concrete hard substance., Dental disease can lead to mouth pain. Your dog may start whining or making other noises of pain or discomfort. This may occur when the dog is eating or when someone touches their mouth.The dental disease may lead to a decreased appetite. This may be due to the food being too difficult or painful to eat. This may lead to weight loss.
Check for loose or missing teeth.
 A swollen jaw may be easily seen by looking at your dog’s face. A swollen jaw may mean that there is an infection in the gums or around a tooth root. If the jaw is swollen, there may be a lump around the eye socket or around the neck.Abscesses that cause swollen jaws can get so bad that they break through the skin and leak pus onto the fur.
 If the gums or teeth become infected in the upper jaw, this can cause problems for the dog’s sinuses. When the tooth root abscesses or gets infected, it may create a pus pocket and that infection can get into the sinuses and nasal cavities.If this occurs, your dog may start sneezing or have a runny nose.

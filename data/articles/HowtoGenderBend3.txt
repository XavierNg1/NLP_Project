 Sometimes becoming someone else allows you to play with gender more easily. You can go outside of yourself and explore other identities. Those that enjoy cosplay, the term for dressing up in costume as a character from fiction, gender bend routinely.The first step is to simply pick a character you love, regardless of their sex. For example, this could be a character from your favorite TV show, comic, book, or movie.
 When doing cosplay, you have the ability to change the character in a variety of ways. Along with changing the character's time period or clothing, you can also change their gender.For example, who says that Darth Vader has to be male? Try making a cosplay outfit where Darth Vader will be read as a woman.
Another example could be Snow White. How could you make an outfit that gets read as male but also as Snow White?

, You don't always have to change the character's gender to gender bend in cosplay. Instead, you could choose a character that is a sex that you are not.For instance, if you identify as a woman, you could choose to dress up as a male Luke Skywalker. Basically, you would be gender bending by dressing in drag.

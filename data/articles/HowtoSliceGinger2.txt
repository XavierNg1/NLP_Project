 Hold a clean, sharp chef’s knife in your dominant hand and hold the ginger firmly against a cutting board. Take care not to let the ginger slip or slide while you are cutting.
 Ginger is a very fibrous root; the fibers run along the length of the root and its lobes. Cut across the fibers so that the knife is perpendicular to them while you are cutting.
 As you cut the ginger across the fibers, you will be cutting little round shapes, aptly named “coins”. You can use these coins as they are (which are great for making candied ginger) or you can continue slicing., Stack two or three of the coins that you just cut and begin cutting them into slivers. These slivers can be as thick or thin as you desire. If you intend to chop or mince the ginger, you should make these slivers fairly slim.
 Line up several of the ginger matchsticks. Cut the sticks crosswise. In other words, you will be cutting them perpendicular to the length of the ginger.

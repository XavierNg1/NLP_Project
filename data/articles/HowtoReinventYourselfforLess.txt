 Then hit the shops.;
, You know, the 2 euro shops aren't just full of junky toys for kids. If you go to the aisle marked 'Toiletries' and have a good look. When I did, I was shocked to find shampoo, body lotion, etc, for half the price of what they are in pharmacy's. You can kit yourself out with shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, shower gel, mouthwash and body spray for a tenner. Scary, right?Â :)

, You will have to go to the more well known shops to get rid of that hair on your body. If you want to shave, I recommend Venus Embrace. If you want to wax, try a product like Veet. Laser hair removal is also an option, but that is usually very expensive.
 Next, your smile needs to be great. Buy yourself a decent mouthwash. Listerine is the best out there. If you find it very strong, mix it with some water. You will also need toothpaste, Colgate is very good. And get a toothbrush that suits you.
 Buy some pretty nail polish, neon colours are unreal! You can also get manicure sets from 2 euro shops. The same goes for your toenails.
 Nobody likes it. Plucking is a popular option. DO NOT SHAVE FACIAL HAIR! It makes it grow back thicker and courser, and more noticeable.
 Clothes. For the broke people most teenagers are, go to Penny's. Penny's is a girl's best friend. They have EVERYTHING. Shoes, tops, jeans, bags, shorts etc... They also sometimes have makeup.
 Makeup. Get a foundation FOR YOUR SKIN TYPE, blusher, a cute lipgloss, eyeshadow, mascara, eyeliner and lipliner.
 Hair. This will cost money, no matter what. You might have to save up for a while to get this done (or you could ask your mum 'My hair is growing out....' etc etc.

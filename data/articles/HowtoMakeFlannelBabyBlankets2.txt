 You will need 1 yard (0.9 m) of each color or pattern.
 Align a plastic ruler for easy cutting.


Cut 1 color into 8 strips that are 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) wide. Cut another color of flannel into 6 strips that are 6 inches (15.2 cm) wide. Cut the third color into 4 strips that are 9 inches (22.9 cm) wide.
 Take strips that are the same color or pattern and lay them together with the back sides touching. Pin and sew a 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) seam around the perimeter of each pair of strips.


Repeat this with all the strips. When you finish you will have 4 4.5 inch (11.4 cm) strips, 3 6 inch (15.2 cm) strips and 2 9 inch (22.9 cm) strips.
 They should be aligned in this order: 6 inch strip, 4.5 inch strip, 9 inch (22.9 cm) strip, 4.5 inch (11.4 cm) strip, 6 inch (15.2 cm) strip, 4.5 inch (11.4 cm) strip, 9 inch (22.9 cm) strip, 4.5 inch (11.4 cm) strip and 6 inch (15.2 cm) strip.
 Sew the strips together 2 at a time using a top stitch.
 You will have extra fabric from the seams.
 Clip the outer edge of all the seams, interior and exterior. Clip perpendicularly toward the seam every 1/2 inch (1.3 cm).


Make sure you do not clip past the thread, or your work may unravel. When you clip all the seams, fluff the fringe. It is ready to use.

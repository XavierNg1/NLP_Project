 Many companies grow their sales and earnings over time. If earnings grow, the firm has the option of paying more earnings to shareholders as a dividend.

 The Gordon Growth Model makes an assumption that dividends will grow at a specific rate forever.The formula is (Expected dividend per share, one year from today)/ (Investor required rate of return - Growth rate in dividend in perpetuity).
 Earnings kept by the company are referred to as retained earnings. A company's balance in retained earnings is the sum of all earnings less all dividends paid since the business started., Assume the companyâ€™s expected dividend per share one year from now is $5. Decide on an expected rate of return required for an equity (stock) investor of 10%. Make an assumption that the annual dividend growth rate in perpetuity is 2%.
 The Gordon Growth Model would be ($5 / (10% - 2%) = $62.50). $62.50 is the intrinsic value of the stock, using this model. If the current market price of the stock is less than $62.50, the model indicates that the stock is undervalued.

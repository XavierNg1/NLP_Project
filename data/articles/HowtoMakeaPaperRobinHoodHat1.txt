 The paper should be 18 by 12 inches (45.72 by 30.48 cm). Sturdier construction paper works better than thin, flimsy color printer paper or newsprint because it holds the shape of the hat better. Do not use stiff poster board, however, since poster board is a little too unforgiving and difficult to fold.;
, The new dimensions should be 9 by 12 inches (22.86 by 30.48 cm). Position the paper so that the fold is to your right.
 Use a pencil to lightly sketch a curved line from the top right corner, where the fold starts, to a position near the diagonal corner at the bottom left, where the paper opens. Your line should end about 2 inches (5 cm) above the corner to make the brim easier to fold later on.
 Use scissors to carefully cut along the line. Keep the paper folded so that both sides are cut symmetrically.
 While your paper is still folded, fold along the curved edge. The new fold should start at the upper right-hand corner, where your curved line started, and extend down to the place where the curved line stopped, approximately 2 inches (5 cm) above the diagonal corner at the lower left.
 Make a symmetrical mirror fold on the opposite side of your hat so that the brim is even all the way around.
 Turn the hat so that the bottom right corner, which had no curve connected to it, becomes the top. The fold or crease between this corner and the corner where your curved edge began form the front crease of the hat. Unfold the hat enough so that the bottom, where the rim now lies, is slightly opened. Bring the back together.
 Adjust the size of the hat by changing how much paper overlaps in the back. Once you have a size that fits your head or the head of whoever will be wearing the hat, staple it in place.


You can also add a drop or thin line of glue along the back of the hat for added support after you staple it in place.

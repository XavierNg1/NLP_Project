 It could be farming, tourism, preservation or a reptile skin factory.;
, Plywood is excellent but thick cardboard would also work well.
 It can include areas for jungle, for plains, for forest, for river beds and swamps. Mark out areas where you might put cages, enclosures, a veterinary clinic, cafe for visitors and have an entrance area as well. As part of the planning, make sure to get the scale accurate; for example, you don't want to keep a Tyrannosaurus Rex in a garden - it would need a wide plains area to expend its energy.
 Make these from cardboard, wire, paper, odds and ends around the house etc. Use your imagination to create a wide range of 3D elements that sit on the board. You might also need to add fences - simple ones can be used and you can pretend that they are large enough to keep in the dinosaurs.
, Plastic dinosaur toys and models can be purchased from many places, from dollar stores, toy stores, supermarket toy areas, hobby stores etc. Wooden ones can also be purchased from dollar and hobby stores; these you can assemble yourself and paint in colors as wished.
 Create miniature signs and attach these to toothpicks. Stick these on the board with poster tack or similar temporary adhesive that can be moved around as wished.
 Part of your prehistoric zoo could contain a hatchery with eggs and live young being raised as one of the key attractions. Make small eggs from modeling clay or similar craft material. Create nests and have live young displays., Select small plastic people figures. Borrow them from your Lego sets or purchase special miniature people. Position them around the zoo, enjoying themselves observing the antics of the dinosaurs. Don't forget to add zoo-keepers as well; it might be a good idea to paint them all the same color or design.
 This will take quite some time to put together and should be enjoyed as an ongoing, long-term project. It might also make a great science project or a show-and-tell item.

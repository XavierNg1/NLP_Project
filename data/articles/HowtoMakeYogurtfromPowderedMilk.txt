 For this article, there is a small Coleman camping cooler that measures 10 inches (25.4Â cm) wide by 17 long by 11 tall. This size is perfect for holding 4 2 quart Ball canning jars of yogurt and 4 half gallon jugs of hot water to help keep it all warm.;
, Just use the hottest water you can get from the kitchen tap. If you can stand to keep your hands in it for more than a few moments, it is OK.



If you use Country Cream brand, one cup of powder mixed in 4 cups of water makes a regular (thin) yogurt. 3 cups of powder in 3 cups of water makes a thicker Greek Style yogurt. Pour the warm milk into jars.
,,,, Pour a little water out of some of the jugs it they don't quite fit.
, If it has congealed (like jelly) it is ready. If it is still runny, replace the water in the jugs with hot water and put the lid back on for a few more hours.

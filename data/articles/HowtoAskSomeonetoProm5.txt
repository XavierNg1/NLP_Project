 Of any of the ways to ask a date to prom, a scavenger hunt may be the most time consuming, but it is also a super cute way to do it (and is fun for both you and your prospective date.)

, Thornless roses are best for this method because your prospective date will be gathering the roses and holding them in his/her hands.


You do not necessarily need to use roses-- you can really choose any object so long as you buy a dozen of them. For instance, you could use a dozen footballs, a dozen wrapped cupcakes, a dozen skateboards...you get the picture.
 Tie a clue to 11 of the roses (or whatever object you have chosen to use.) Don’t make the clues too hard or your date may never find you. To make it easier, place the roses within walking distance (around your school perhaps?) so that your prospective date can get to them easily.
 Place yourself in the last spot, holding the last rose (or other object.) If possible, have a friend go with your prospective date on the scavenger hunt--that way your friend can text you when your date is getting close so you don’t just have to sit in the same spot for an hour.


If you want, along with the rose you can also hold a sign that says ‘Prom?’ just to make it really clear as to what this scavenger hunt is all about.

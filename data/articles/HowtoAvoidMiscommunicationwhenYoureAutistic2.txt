 Focus on what they are saying, not on what you are going to say to them. Your first goal is to understand their point of view.


If you need to stim in order to pay attention, find a helpful and non-distracting stim. Bouncing your foot, fiddling with jewelry, squeezing a stim toy, et cetera, are all helpful stims.
If the environment is distracting, say so. Ask if you could move to a quieter place, so you can listen better.
 One part of communication is listening. Listen closely to what the person is saying. Pretend you are them, and think how you would see the situation if you were them. Nonverbal. These include emotions, how a person really feels about a topic, sarcasm, wishes, jokes, seriousness, etc. How would you feel if you were in their situation?

, It's absolutely okay to ask people to clarify, and they usually prefer that you'd ask rather than you'd guess and get things mixed up. You can use scripts such as...


"Did you mean...?"
"How do you feel about that?"
"Do you really mean it or are you just joking?"
"Are you really serious, because it's hard for me to tell."
When in doubt, ask, instead of assuming.
  Say things like, "So, I hear you saying that...."  or, "I think you mean..., right?"  See what they say in return. You are being like a detective, gathering clues about what they're telling you and what they're feeling, to make sure your impressions match the other person's intention, to make sure you understand them.
 Notice what direction they are looking, if their body seems "open" or "closed," how straight their posture is, and how this compares to their "normal" baseline. This can hint at what they are feeling inside.



Reading faces and body language is a skill. You can learn and work on it.
This is harder for some people than others. If keeping track of it is distracting or overwhelming, refocus on the content of their words.

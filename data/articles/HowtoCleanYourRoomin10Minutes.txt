 As you walk around, pick up any items on the floor, on the backs of chairs, and anything out of place (including little knick-knacks).;

If something belongs in the room you are in, put it in its proper place.



Put anything that belongs in the same room in one pile.



There is no point making a pile unless you have to walk to a different room. It's a huge waste of time to pick up one item, take it to another room, then go back and continue cleaning. Take everything that belongs in another room at the same time.
 As you walk around the room, pick up items as you go along, then dust, vacuum, and organize.
 Start with anything that is dark wood, as dust shows more clearly on dark surfaces. Don’t use a dry rag; instead, buy wood cleaners or simply use a wet rag in warm water and a mild soap. Cleaning this way will prevent dust from flying around the room as you clean. In the doorway of the room, spritz a bit of nice-smelling perfume and waft it around with your hand so when people walk in they smell something nice.
 If you vacuum before you dust, the dust will settle and you'll have to vacuum again. Nothing gives a better impression of a clean room than freshly-vacuumed rugs. Buy a perfumed vacuum powder to improve the overall smell of the room as you clean. This will save you time in the long run. Don’t bother vacuuming curtains or upholstery. It takes too much time and pulls you away from other, more important tasks.









To kill odors on carpets and upholstery, spray them lightly with a solution of 1 part white vinegar:5 parts water solution.
 This way, you can spray them on and move on to clean somewhere else while you wait for the chemicals to work on a particular surface. Come back later and simply mop the dirt up.

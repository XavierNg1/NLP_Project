 Research your area online to find any print or online arts quarterlies. They require events to be submitted 1 to 3 months in advance, so begin your research as soon as your dates and other information is set.


If your demographic is over the age of 40, it is a good idea to focus equally on print and online marketing.
 Most local magazines list social calendars that require events to be submitted up to a month in advance. Submit photos if that option is available to you, and ask to be listed on the website as well.
 Many local magazines and newspapers have reasonable rates. Print advertising will generally be cheaper if you can provide your own graphic design.


Do not advertise an art event with a print ad if you are promoting a very exclusive show for collectors. If your show is by invitation only, then you will encourage large, famous collectors by creating a buzz of exclusivity around the event.
 This means you will have them back to send to your gallery database and post 1 month from the show's date.
 Postcards can be sent by mail as an announcement and given out at the show. Calendars can be sold at the event to supplement income from art sales; just make sure you have the artists' rights to print their photographs.

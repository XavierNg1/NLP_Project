 Then find out how much room to move you have on the recommended supplies. If you don't have to choose the exact same items listed, then you can swap them out for eco-friendly versions.


In some cases, the school supplies list may already have taken eco-friendly needs into account. If so, you're all set!
In other cases, you may find it hard to substitute some items, such as the plastic pockets mentioned in the above list. In this case, find out if you really do need them, or what alternatives you can find.;
, If you present your case politely and reassure your teacher that you won't be substituting with inferior quality, you may just get the nod to change to different supplies.


Your parents may be able to help here. If they're environmentally-conscious too, they may be able to discuss this directly with the teacher or school. All the same, it is good for you to learn how to ask for yourself too!

 Before starting, you need to have purchased or have figure skates with you. If you've never worn skates before, it's recommended that you try skating in rental skates first, to see if skating is even what you want to keep doing. When you're happy that it is, then invest in your own pair of skates.


Consider getting the skates custom molded to your foot shape and size. You can go to your local skate shops and places where they sell and repair sports gear; ask them if they do skate molding.;
, Are they the correct size? If they're too large, they'll cause blisters; too small and you'll be in pain. Fit is extremely important; the shoe must fit well and it doesn't need to be expensive to achieve good fit.


The heel should fit firmly around the ankle. This area steers your foot around curves and turns.
The skate must be firmly around your foot. If you can fling your leg and you feel your foot move in the skate, it's too loose.
 If they're new, this shouldn't be a problem. If borrowed or hand-me-down, check that the blades are sharp.
 This is especially important at the ankle area.
 Lots of short bursts work best.
 Wear the skates around your house as much as possible. Wear while watching TV, listening to music, playing games or doing odd jobs around the house.


Don't forget to put on your skate guards and blade mounts, the ground will most likely damage the blades on your skates.
 For example, do knee bends, plies, etc., while wearing your figure skates.
 This heat helps expand the leather which makes the skate fit better to the form of your foot.
 On the ice, try to do more things that bend down and use your ankles a lot. This helps to get used to the feeling of skating in the new boosts.



The pain should be pretty minimal, if you start having cramps in your arch or a feeling of swelling, take off your skates and stretch your foot.
It might help to not tie your skates all the way up, leave the top two sections loose so your ankles can move around a bit more.

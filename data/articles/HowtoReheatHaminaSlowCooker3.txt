 If the ham is too tall, the slow cooker's lid may not fit. Instead, you can use aluminum foil to make a tent that will cover the ham. Pull the foil over the top of the slow cooker, tearing off a piece that is large enough to cover the entire basin and the ham. Gently press the foil around the top of the pot, making sure that the ham is completely covered. Do not touch the foil while it is cooking; only remove it to check the temperature of the ham.Be extremely careful as you remove the foil, as steam may have built up under the foil. It may be extremely hot.
 If the ham is too large or awkwardly shaped, it may not fit in the pot correctly. You can cut off pieces of the ham to make it fit inside of the pot. Fit these pieces around the main chunk of ham in the slow cooker. You might also decide to cook them separately or to discard them.If you have a boneless ham, you can cut up the ham however you please so that it fits most conveniently in the slow cooker.
If you have a bone-in ham, you should slice parallel above the bone, as most kitchen knives will not be sharp enough to cut into the bone.
 The slow cooker method may not be ideal for ham that has already been sliced into separate pieces off the bone. While spiral-sliced hams can be reheated if they remain on the bone, ham steaks, slices, and chunks should be cooked using a different method.


You can reheat a ham steak or slice in a skillet until it is slightly browned on either side. You can also simmer it with a cup of water for two minutes to remove some of the saltiness.Ham chunks can be reheated by warming them up in a skillet or microwave. You can also add them to soups, omelets, and other recipes. You do not have reheat the chunks before adding them.

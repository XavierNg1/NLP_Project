 Ideally, choose plants whose leaves have grown freely without trimming. Choose a warm, dry morning when dew is no longer present.Seed collection from chicory is typically done in July.Wear gardening gloves and watch out for small bees, which enjoy chicory flowers., You can dry chicory as you would herbs. To air dry plants, tie them near the ends of the stems in small bunches. Wrap them loosely in muslin or paper bags that will collect any fallen seeds. Place them in a well-ventilated location, that is not in direct sunlight, for seven to ten days.Alternately, you can dry the plants on a rack in an airing cupboard or warming drawer, or use an oven or microwave to dry them.
If you live in a humid location, try using a small commercial dehydrator to prevent mold.
 Find seeds in small clusters between bunches of leaves. Use a tiny spoon or round tweezers to carefully scoop underneath the seeds to extract them. Alternately, a faster method is to either crush the pods in a cloth bag, or plant the entire pod.Place seedpods in a cloth bag, and smash the bag with a wooden mallet. Screen and winnow them to remove unneeded debris.
If you plant the entire pods without separating the seeds, multiple seedlings will grow close together and will need thinning.

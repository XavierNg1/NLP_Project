 Any rechargeable battery has around 500 recharge cycles, after which, you'll need a new one. You probably already know this(reduce brightness, back lighting, fast-forwarding etc).;
, Your iPod has a lithium ion battery, For best results, recharge it frequently. Once in a month, let it drain completely and then fully charge it again.
 This is more important than you might be thinking.
 Also avoid contact with water. If your iPod does get drenched, IMMEDIATELY turn it off. Dry it out gently using a soft towel, then leave it to dry completely(preferably under a fan).
 A stitch in time saves nine.

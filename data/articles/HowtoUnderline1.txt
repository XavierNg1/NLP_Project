 Whatever word processing program you're using, you need to start by highlighting the text you want to underline with your cursor. This can be done by dragging the cursor, or double-clicking a single line of text, if you want to underline everything.;
, In Microsoft Word, you need to navigate to the Font tab to find the group of options that includes italicizing, bolding, and underlining.


In Word 2012, you need to click on the "Home" tab and select the font group.
In Word 2008 or older, you need to go to "View" and select Formatting Palette, or click open the formatting palette at the top of the screen and switch to the "Font" tab, if it's not there already.
 This looks like an uppercase "U" that is underlined. All you need to do is select it and the text will be underlined automatically, if all you want is a single line under the text.
 Word also offers a variety of other underline styles that you can select in the same way, after clicking the "Style" box. You can use a double underline, or other more decorative underlines for the text. Different versions of Word will have different options available.
 To change the color of the underline, click Underline color, and then click the color that you want from the palette available.

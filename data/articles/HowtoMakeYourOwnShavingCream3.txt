 The point of using shaving cream is to provide a smooth surface that allows your razor to glide easily over your skin and cut through your hair without snagging. You can achieve these results without using a fancy cream; all you really need are oil and a moisturizer. Here's what to get:1 cup oil, such as melted coconut oil, almond oil, or olive oil
1/3 cup moisturizer, such as aloe vera gel, honey or rosewater

, Pour the oil and moisturizer into a blender and blend on high for a few minutes to thoroughly mix your two-ingredient cream. The resulting mixture should be loose and creamy.
 While you might love the idea of using just two easy ingredients, it's fine to make a few additions if you want to customize your shaving cream. Try any or all of the following:


Up to 10 drops of your favorite essential oil
One tablespoon baking soda, if you like a thicker cream
The contents of one vitamin E capsule, to help preserve the shaving cream

, This will keep it fresh and make it easy to dispense exactly as much as you need for each shave. This two-ingredient shaving cream should be stored in a cool, dark place so the oil doesn't spoil.

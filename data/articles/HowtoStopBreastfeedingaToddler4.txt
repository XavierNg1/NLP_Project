 Babies are easily distracted. Step outside with your baby and go for a walk. Sing a favorite song or try using food as a distraction. Be creative ad do whatever it takes to change his focus.
 A busy baby will be less likely to think about stopping what he is doing to nurse. As children age, they naturally want to avoid naps. They prefer to continue exploring the magnificent world of wonders around them until they pass out or become so cranky that they eventually pass out.
 A ride in the car or walk in the carriage may work well in place of being nursed to sleep. Even some sleepy time with dad in the hammock can do the trick.

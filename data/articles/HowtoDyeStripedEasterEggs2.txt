 This method will work best with hard boiled eggs, but you can use hallow or blown-out eggs as well. If you choose to use hallow or blown-out eggs, however, be sure to cover the holes with speckling or paper clay., You can use strips of tape as they are, or cut them lengthwise to create thinner stripes.Run your fingernail over the edges of the tape to seal it down, otherwise, the dye will creep underneath., Stir together Â½ cup (120 milliliters) of boiling water, 1 teaspoon of vinegar, and 10 to 20 drops of food coloring. Pour it into a cup small enough to completely submerge an egg in., Carefully set the egg into the dye. If it is a hallow egg, you will need to hold it down. Leave the egg in the dye for up to 5 minutes. The longer you leave the egg in the dye, the darker it will become., Use a wire egg holder or a pair of tongs to pull the egg out of the dye. Set the egg down some place where it won't roll over, and leave it there until it dries., The egg under the tape will still be white.Discard the tape once you have it off., This will change the stripes from white to colored. Keep in mind that this will also change the overall color of the egg as well. Dye is translucent, so it will mix with whatever color you dyed the egg first. Not all colors look good when mixed together.

Remember to let the egg dry if you re-dye it.

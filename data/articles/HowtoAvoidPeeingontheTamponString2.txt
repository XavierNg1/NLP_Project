 There shouldn't be any health repercussions if you accidentally pee on the string.You can squeeze the string with a piece of toilet paper to dry it off before pulling up your pants.It's really a matter of preference--if you are uncomfortable with the feeling of a wet string, or worry about smell, you can change your tampon if you wish.
There has never been a documented case of infection due to urinating while wearing a tampon., If the actual tampon gets wet, it means it wasn't inserted properly and should be changed. Your tampon should be inserted far enough into your vagina so no part of the tampon itself is showing (the absorbent part), only the string.It is not necessary to change your tampon every time you urinate. Change your tampon based on how long you've had it in (never over eight hours) or if your tampon is leaking or "full."
If your tampon isn't ready to be changed, you will meet some resistance when you pull on the string.
Always try to match your tampon to your flow--don't wear a super absorbent tampon on a day when your flow is light. This can make removing the tampon uncomfortable.
 While it's fine to get urine on your tampon string, feces contains tons of bacteria that can lead to infection.If you do get feces on your tampon string, use a wad of toilet paper to remove the tampon and throw it away.
Make sure your hands are clean before attempting to insert another tampon--if there is feces on your hands, you could spread an infection to your urinary tract or vagina.
 Before trying tampons, some girls are unsure if it's even possible to wear a tampon and urinate. This can keep some girls from using tampons, since they don't want to change it every time they pee or somehow harm themselves or disrupt their periods.A woman's body has an opening specifically for urine--the urethra. Feces comes through the anus. Your menstrual blood comes out of your vagina, which is located between your urethra and anus.

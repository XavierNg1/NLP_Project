 Start close to the peak of your skull and do a loose French braid down to the nape of your neck. Leave the tail of your hair unbraided for now, and hold it there with one hand.









This also works with a fishtail braid. Just make sure to start high on your head and finish at the nape of your neck.
If you want to do a lower braid, try using a banana-shaped barrette instead of a clip. A barrette will be smaller.
 Open the clip and place it against your head so that the jaws of the clip are on either side of your braid and the end of your braid falls just over the hinge. The tail of your braid will be sticking out over the clip.
 Close it tight against your head so that the teeth of the clip lift your braid slightly. If your braid is too tight to insert the clip, use your fingers to loosen it a bit so you can insert the sides of the clip under it and fasten it toward the top of your braid.
 Now that the clip is in place, check for areas where it's showing. You want the braid to completely hide the clip from view. If you see a place where the clip is poking out, gently loosen that section of your braid just a little to cover it. Use bobby pins if necessary.
 All that's left is to tuck the unbraided tail of hair under and pin it in place. It might help to twist the tail before tucking it under. Hold the look in place with hairspray.









If your hair is too heave to pin up, just leave the tail loose.
Alternately, you could finish braiding the tail and secure it with a rubber band.

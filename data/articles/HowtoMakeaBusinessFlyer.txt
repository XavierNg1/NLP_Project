 You want the customer to feel that you know what you are talking about. Don't ask too many questions about what the customer requires. As the person offering the service, you should already know and be convinced of what they want as a client. If you ask too many questions it will become clear to the customer that you are out of touch.;
, Whilst it's good to let them know, you know what you are talking about, people don't like to be force fed large bodies of text. Especially when it has been pushed through their letter box. You want to say what you are offering customers in as few words as possible. Remember people don't like to be preached at.
 What is your unique selling point? You need to think about this carefully as it could make or break you.
 Is it a product aimed at the masses or the lucky few? Is your advertising aimed at home owners or businesses? Design appropriately. Don't try to please everyone or your advert will become vague and unspecific.
 Offers are amazingly powerful as a marketing tool. People will often buy things because they believe they are getting a special rate when they wouldn't normally buy the product in the first place. Two for one and half price are classic examples.
 Clients love it. It builds up customer loyalty along with giving you good reviews through word of mouth.
, If you want to look professional, however much it pains you to do it, find a professional graphic designer to give your leaflet that magic touch. Graphic designers are trained to deliver the best results and can see things you haven't been trained to see. They know all the tricks of the trade.

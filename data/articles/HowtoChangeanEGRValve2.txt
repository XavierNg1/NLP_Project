 A multimeter tests the electrical wiring in your vehicle. The multimeter has a few settings, but you only need to set it to Volts for this test. The multimeter has black (negative) and red (positive) leads with metal clamps that connect to the wiring in your engine.It’s recommended that you use a digital multimeter for this test. A digital multimeter will display only the test results. An analog multimeter will be harder to read because every possible result on its range is printed at the top.
 A large “V” denotes the voltage setting. The range for the volts is located between two bold lines.
 Consult your owner’s manual to find the exact location of the valve as it varies depending on the make and model of your vehicle. Once you have located the valve, look for an electrical connector on top of it. This connector will have the circuits you need to test.
 Each circuit on the EGR is labeled from "A" to "E." , The easiest and closest ground is the negative post on the vehicle’s battery.
 If the results on the multimeter show a reading above .9 Volts, then something (most likely carbon) is blocking the EGR valve. If the multimeter shows little or no voltage, then the EGR valve is most likely faulty. If the reading is between .6 and .9 Volts, then this means the EGR valve is working properly.

, Then add about two inches (5cm) to that, to allow space for tying. Mark the measurement you've made and cut a piece of string (it can also be wire, stretchy sting, yarn, or just regular thin string) the length of the measurement.
 Although you can thread beads randomly, it is more effective if you plan the bead layout before threading. This can be done by drawing a design on paper or by laying out the actual beads to be used on a jewelry board or on white paper or a clean surface. Using the beads is a good approach because it lets you visualize the end result easily and you can make instant changes to perfect the layout as you go. There are endless design possibilities, so don't be afraid to try out many ways. If you have a few designs you like, you can always make more rings and give them away to friends.


Be careful not to drop the string while you're adding beads, or else all the beads will fall off. It's a good idea to work over a tray in case this happens, so that the beads are easy to retrieve.You may want to tape one end of the string down on a flat surface to easily thread the beads.
Don't put beads along the entirety string or you'll have to remove them to be able to tie the ring together.
 Make sure that the ring fits before double knotting it.


Be sure to double or even triple knot your ties. If you don't, the ring risks falling apart.
 This method can also be applied to other jewelry such as necklaces and bracelets. Just adjust the measurements as needed.

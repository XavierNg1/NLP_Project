, It can be your favorite book, a movie star, sports, or anything you want. The most popular themes at the moment would have to be Neo-related (NR), Scribble, and Themeless (which means it's a completely random guild).
 It can be anything you want, but be creative and make it match what you want your theme to be about. Be careful not to use too many symbols, instead don't be afraid of making up your own words. e.g. Funstorpia over â™¥&&$$FunLand^^%%#$#!

, If you just started, it is better to cover up that blank spot with a pretty guild layout.
 Get a piece of paper and a pen or pencil and start coming up with ideas. You can also have pages for your ideas like a guild webbie and such.
 Go to the Neopets guild boards. It will take you about a month to get about 10 members. Keep advertising and asking other members to refer people via their shop pages to build up your guild beyond this number.
 If you aren't trying to be active, do you think your members will try? Always maintain your guild, and remember to chat on the message boards daily for people to have more attention.

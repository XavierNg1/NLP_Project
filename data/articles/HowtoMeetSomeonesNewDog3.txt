 Be sure to read the dogâ€™s body language carefully to gauge whether or not it wants to interact with you. Any signs of fear or unease should be recognized and respected; you can always try approaching the dog on another occasion when it might be more responsive. Some observable signs that you should back off could include:growling
bared teeth
flattened ears
aggressive eye contact
crouching with muscles tensed and tail stiff

, Be sure to avoid approaching the dog if it is eating or chewing on a bone or treat. Your approach might be seen as an attempt to take away its food, which will almost certainly be met with a negative response. Wait until the dog is finished eating, or simply leave the dog alone altogether., If your encounter makes the dog overexcited and it begins biting your hands or jumping on you, withdraw yourself immediately. Turn away from the dog and cross your arms, signalling your withdrawal from the interaction. Ignore the dog until it calms down; if its owner has just adopted it, it will likely still be in a process of behavioral adjustment and need to be prompted to calm down.

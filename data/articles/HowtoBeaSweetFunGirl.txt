 If you have neat handwriting, people will see you more as a neat, organized person.Maybe keep a journal between your friends and yourself to pass around with each other and write notes in it to and from each other to read.;
, If you're nice, people will think better of you than you could or might be. Offer to do things in class and don't be afraid to have a wrong answer.
 Having good skin and gently-washed hair will make you look prettier than you already are.
, If you judge by someone's appearance and talk about it, people will think that you're not the bubbly girl that they thought you were. If you do judge, keep it to yourself or write it in a journal or diary to express what you think and not keep it piled up.
 Wear things that you like and are comfortable to you. Don't wear things to blend in with the crowd.
 You don't have to be a perfect girl, but you do need to love who you are. If you follow these steps, you're on your way to a bright future.If you struggle with low self esteem, you can borrow your confidence from your favorite celebrity, or God, if that is what you believe in.
 Get involved in a club or support a cause. Being a brainy babe is great as you are on the right track to a beautiful future. Also, brains and beauty together are a deadly combo; just don't be mean about it. Nobody wants to be friends with a bragger!

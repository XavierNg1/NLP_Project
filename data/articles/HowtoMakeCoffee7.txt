The flavor of the coffee depend on a lot of factors: where the beans were grown, at what elevation, the varietal of coffee tree, and how they are processed, dried, and roasted.

If it's possible, buy beans from a local roaster, and grind them at home as needed, to ensure the freshest, most flavorful cup of coffee.

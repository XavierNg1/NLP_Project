, Mealybugs thrive in a nitrogen-rich soil, so be careful that you only feed your plants when necessary.
 Immediately wash out rags. If you are using paper towels, place used towels in a plastic sack and discard.


Remember to look for eggs sacks and remove those as well. The egg sacks will look like small cotton balls attached to the plant.
,, These sprays will suffocate or dry out the mealybugs and kill them. However, it is very difficult to get the egg sacks and crawlies that have gone into places where the spray cannot reach.


Spray a mealybug-specific pesticide onto the plant to get immediate results on mealybug control. Pesticide sprays, however, are only a short-term solution for mealybug control and should not be used as the only method of controlling the infestation.
 Sometimes it may be virtually impossible to get a mealybug infestation under control, and the best course of action may be to replace the plant with one that is not infected.

In this section, we'll use Windows 8's search function to get to the Program Access menu quickly. Start by bringing up the search bar. There are a few ways to do this:

Move your mouse to the very top right corner of the screen. Leave it still for a second or two and a menu should pop in from the right side of the screen. Click the magnifying glass icon.
If you have a touchscreen monitor, just swipe inward from the right side of the screen and tap on the magnifying glass icon.
Alternatively, bring up the Start screen (click the Windows icon in the taskbar, which is in the bottom left by default) and click the small magnifying glass in the top right.



Note: If you don't usually have a hard time finding things on Windows 8, you can skip this section and simply find the Program Access Menu under Control Panel>All Control Panel Items>Default Programs.
;
,


A list of related options should pop up. Select the "Default Programs" option that should be at the top of the list.
If you can't find the "Default Programs" option, you can search for "Control Panel", select the Control Panel option, click "Program," and finally click "Default Programs" to get to the same location.,


This option is listed at the bottom of the Default Programs screen.

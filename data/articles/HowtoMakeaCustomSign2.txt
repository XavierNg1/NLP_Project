 Go to your local hardware store and buy a plywood board in whatever size you want. You can, of course, get something fancier if you want or even buy a pre-made chalk board, but you'll need a nice flat surface to make your sign on.


An alternative method, which works best for small signs, would be to use a premade fame with backing, as this will give you all the parts you need.
 You can get chalkboard paint from your local hardware or paint store, or make it yourself by mixing 1 tbsp of unsanded grout for every 1/2 cup of paint in any color. Prime with all-purpose paint first if you need to and then paint at least coats with the chalkboard paint.


Let the paint dry completely before continuing.
 You can either leave the edges as they are (best if you want a modern look), build a frame for the board, or tape off several inches of the wood so that you create the appearance of a frame.
 Using whatever method you decided on above, create the text using chalk or chalk pencils on your chalkboard. the stencils may only provide the faint outline, but you can add shadows and textures by letting your artistic side shine through. If you want the sign to be permanent, get polyurethane spray (or a product like Kyrlon's Crystal Clear) and carefully spray it over your sign.
 Attach hooks, a string or any other preferred hanging mechanism and use a level to make sure it's straight. Enjoy!

 You can only change your privacy options from within the Instagram app. When you make your account private, you'll need to approve each person that follows you before they can see your posts. This ensures that people you block cannot create new accounts or log out to see your content.
 You can get to this by tapping the silhouette at the bottom of the screen.
 Tap the gear icon (iOS) or the â‹® button (Android) in the upper right corner of your profile. This will allow you to change your privacy settings.
 You will be asked to confirm if you want to. When your account is set to private, only your approved Followers can view the photo. This will prevent blocked users from creating a new account to view your posts.

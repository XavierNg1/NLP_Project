 If your phyllo cups were stored in the freezer, you’ll want to pull them out now to let them defrost a bit while you wash and brush your rhubarb stalks.;
, To avoid the awkwardness of the curve of the stalk, halve the stalks, then quarter each half length-wise and chop from there. Wash and dice the apple as well.
 Heat a large lidded pan (lid off) at medium high. When the pan gets hot, spoon your diced rhubarb and apple mixture into the pan. Add 4 teaspoons of organic granulated sugar and stir well. Turn the heat down to medium low, and cover. Let it cook for five minutes.
 After the compote’s five minutes are up, pull the lid off and check it out. You should start to see at least some progress towards the mixture starting to look a little bit like apple-sauce! Stir some more, cover up again and depending on how done it looks, you may need to give it 5 more minutes and check back. (It is recommended to cook just until a few solid chunks of rhubarb and apple are left, and when it looks much like an apple-sauce.) Turn the burner off and remove the compote from the heat.
, Put about 1 1/2 tablespoons or so in each cup. Once you’ve filled the cups, take 4 teaspoons of brown sugar in a little bowl and sprinkle a little bit of brown sugar on top of each cup until you’ve gotten a little bit into each one.
 You can make as many or as few tarts as you’ve got shells for.

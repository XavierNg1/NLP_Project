 Both Windows 7 and Windows 8 have file history backup utilities. These need to have been enabled in order to use them to recover older versions of files.


See this guide for detailed information on using File History for Windows 8.
 You will need to configure Time Machine to store your backups on an external hard drive beforehand, but you will then have access to all the different versions of that file over time.


See this guide for detailed information on using Time Machine.

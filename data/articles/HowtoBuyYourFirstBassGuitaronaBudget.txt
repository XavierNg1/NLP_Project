 A new bass guitar can cost anywhere from $200 to $5000 depending on the brand, quality, and finish. Used basses tend to range from $100 to $1500 and are often just as good, although pricing and selection will vary from one locale to another.;
, Over the last year or two, some department stores (such as Target and Walmart) began carrying "starter" instruments that are far less expensive than you might find in a guitar shop. For example, a starter bass currently listed at Target.com is priced at $129. However, your best bet is to check guitar shops and pawn shops frequently for a good deal. Also, check the classified ads. Most people have no idea what they are selling, and you can get a good deal.
 Most guitar shops will let you plug in and play around with any instrument right in the store. See if you like how it sounds, looks, and feels in your hands. Do not buy something used without playing it first unless it comes from a reputable dealer and has some sort of return policy if it turns out you do not like it. Be very cautious about buying instruments on internet sites such as eBay. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
 Let him/her play any instruments you are considering buying. If you are a parent buying an instrument for your son or daughter, find someone who can try instruments for you. Your child will thank you later.
 Most used equipment drops in price over the years and can offer much better quality and sound for the same price as a new bass. Always check a used instrument for damage, and play it (or have someone else play it) before buying it. If you are buying remotely and you cannot have physical access to it, use your judgment and make sure you can have it returned.

 Gnats can often be a problem while you are inside. If they are in your house, make sure that you close all your doors and windows.


Seal any unnecessary openings. If necessary, use tape or chalk to close gaps under door frames or around window edges. You can use silicone caulk to seal cracks and crevices in baseboards, cupboards, sinks, electrical outlets and so on. You may want to buy a caulking gun to make this process easier.
Install screens on the outside of your windows, doors, and heating and cooling vents that are small enough that gnats can not get through. Charcoal fiberglass screens work best. Remove anything around the exterior that may attract gnats. Stacked firewood, leaves, debris, garbage, and standing water can all attract gnats. Keep these at least 18 inches from the exterior of the house., Loose garden netting can be used to cover an outdoor dinner table or a camping tent. Or you can buy removable screens to cover porch or deck areas. use staples or splines to keep them in place., A good short-term solution is to keep air circulating in the area where you are. Fans will drive gnats away, and the airflow prevents them from landing on and biting you. This is a good short-term solution for either indoors or outdoors.

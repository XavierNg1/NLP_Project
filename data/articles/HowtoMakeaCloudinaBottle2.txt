 Assemble all your supplies for this science experiment before you start. Have the following on hand:


Large glass jar (one gallon size) with lid
Aerosol (hairspray or air freshener)
Flashlight or lamp
Water
Dark-colored paper and flashlight

, Put enough water in the jar to cover the bottom (about 2 centimeters). Swirl the water around so that the jar heats up. This will also prevent any condensation from forming in the jar.


The jar will be very hot. Be sure to use oven mitts to hold the jar.
 Turn the jar lid upside down so that it’s a little bowl. Place two ice cubes in the lid. Lay the lid on top of the jar. You may now see some condensation in the jar.
 Use an aerosol product like hairspray or air freshener to spray into the jar. Lift the iced lid up and quickly spray a small amount into the jar. Replace the lid to trap the aerosol in the jar.
 Use a dark piece of paper to create contrast. This way, you will be able to see the cloud that has formed in the jar.


You can also use a flashlight to shine into the jar.
 When you lift the lid off the jar, the cloud will float out. You can let it pass through your fingers.
 You created hot, moist air in the jar when you poured in the boiling water. The ice on the lid works to cool the air as it rises. This water vapor will turn back into a liquid when it cools, but it needs a surface to condense on. When you spray the aerosol into the jar, you’ve given the water vapor a surface. The molecules stick to the aerosol and condense into cloud droplets.The clouds swirl around inside the jar because the air inside is swirling around. The warm air is rising while the cool air is sinking. You can see the movement of air as the clouds swirl.

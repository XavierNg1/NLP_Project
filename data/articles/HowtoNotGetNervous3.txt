 Are you feeling nervous about something that you can solve or are you nervous about something beyond your control?


If you are nervous about a possible situation rather than an actual one, tell yourself that it is beyond your control.What's the point in being nervous about something that's going to happen either way? Nervous about the apocalypse coming? Easy to see that that's pointless -- how is your problem different?
If your problem is actual and solvable, take action to find possible solutions. For example, if you are nervous about making your rent payment on time, call your landlord and ask about a potential extension.
 Many people develop a routine of extreme nervousness because they think that it is doing them some good or pushing them to perform. But in the end, being nervous is just time wasted that you could have spent feeling, well, almost anything else!


Feeling nervous that a worst-case scenario is about to happen to you sometime in the near future doesn't lead to any positive outcomes. You won't be any more prepared and you'll have lost that precious time to enjoy yourself.
Approach your nervousness rationally and don't allow your body to be controlled by nervous thoughts. Assert your rational mind and let the nervousness know who's boss. P.S. -- It's you.
 Try to practice self-compassion and recognize that you are bound to be nervous at some points in your life.

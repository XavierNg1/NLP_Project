 The first thing you should do is make a pet. First you should do is go to the "Pets" on the left side and when you are there you should have no pets. on the top you will see Make a pet, and Free food. Click Make a pet and go to Free food later.


Once you click there, it will show you all these pets. Choose your preferred pet, such as a Kumos, Feli, Escalade, and more!
After you pick a pet, you must choose the gender and name. It can be anything, but make sure it's not taken! Remember, you can put spaces, question marks, even brackets in your pet's name! Once you've done that, press the finish button and you will have your pet, sitting in the Pets section.;
, Of course, you must be low on sP to get this food. Each day you can feed your pet this food.
 A human avatar, or also known as an HA, avvie or avatar, is a character you can create to dress up. Now you will probably think this is silly and for kids, but it can be very fun and addicting. Go to wardrobe and it will say that you don't have an avatar yet. Go down, and you will see what you can choose for physical features.


This will not be forever, since you can delete your HA and do it all again. Yes, I know the characters naked. I hope you are mature enough to handle this.
If you are finished, you can dress it up! I suggest going to the Clothing Rack for clothes. But don't spend too much!

, The Old Wizard, who is located at the Sacred Lands, gives you wizard tokens if you do his quests. There is also the Item Hunt, which gives you some items and some sP as much as 100k.
 You can talk with people at the forums, go to peoples profiles and comment, anything you want.
 You should only play Subeta if you're having fun. Don't force yourself to play.

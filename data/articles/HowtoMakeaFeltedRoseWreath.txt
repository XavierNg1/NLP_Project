 You're wanting to shrink and felt the poor sweater! And pour more scorn on the hapless sweater by drying in on the hot cycle of your dryer. By the time it comes out, it's absolutely ready for craft use.;
, Click on the template provided here to enlarge. This template shows how to cut the rosette shape (along the dotted line).


The size of the template should be around 3 inches or 7.5cm for the best rosette size. Adjust the template on your computer or by hand as needed.
 Place the template over this circle and cut around the dotted line and the outer circle line. This forms the basis of each rosette.
 You'll need to gradually work your way around the rosette, winding it into place and gluing at the same time.


Allow to dry before proceeding.
At this stage, you can make as many rosettes as you'd like and use them on all sorts of crafty projects from wreaths to clothing decoration.
 Draw a heart shape template in the size of your choosing. Obviously the larger the heart, the more rosettes you'll need to make for gluing on. Cut out the heart on light cardstock. Cut out the middle of the heart, so that you have a broad edge of about 2" (5cm) across for placing the rosettes. Cover the heart with felt the same color as the rosettes, or a suitable contrasting color.


Glue the rosettes onto the heart. Continue until completed. See the introduction photo for the final wreath.

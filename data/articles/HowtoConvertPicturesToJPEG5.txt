 If you have a JPEG file with the wrong file extension, such as if a typo has your file ending with “.JGP” instead of “.JPG,” this method will be useful. This method will not technically “convert” an image to a JPEG.


If your image file is not already a JPEG file, changing the file extension could break your file. See other methods if you’re hoping to turn a different image file into a JPEG file.
File extensions are not case-sensitive. .JPG and .jpg are the same thing.
Before you get started, make a note of the original file extension so that you can change it back if necessary.
 It could be on your desktop, as in the example, or in a separate folder you can access through Finder or Windows Explorer.
 Mac users should click once on the image, click “File,” then “Get Info.” Click the arrow next to “Name and Extension” and remove the check from “Hide Extension.” Click “Save.”

, Erase everything after the “.” in the file name.


On a Mac, click the image once and press ⏎ Return. Click at the end of the file extension and press Delete until you’ve erased everything after the period.
In Windows, right-click the image and select “Rename.” Click at the end of the file extension and press ← Backspace to delete everything after the period.
 Upper or lowercase is fine. Your filename should look something like this: image.jpg. Press ↵ Enter or ⏎ Return.
 Whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, you’ll see a warning about how changing the file extension could make your file unusable. Click “Use.jpg” or “Yes” if you want to make the change. Your file name will now end in .JPG.

 For this project the materials are simple — you’ll need a 14” by 14” pillow form and two pieces of fleece that are at least 16.5” by 16.5”. You will also need a good pair of sewing scissors., Each square of fleece has to be at least 16.5” by 16.5”. Because the pillow form is 14” wide, the additional 2.5” will be used to cut strips to tie the two pieces of fleece together. If you want strips longer than 2.5”, just cut the fleece larger than 16.5” by 16.5”.Once the two squares are cut, cut strips out of all four sides that will be 1” wide and 2.5” long.
 Make sure the two pieces of fleece are on top of each other, with the ‘right' sides of the fleece facing outwards. (Most fleece doesn’t have a good and bad side, so it may not matter.) Starting on one side, start knotting one strip from the top piece of fleece to one strip from the bottom piece of fleece. Use a double knot.Complete knotting 3 of the 4 sides of the pillow case.
 Once 3 of the 4 sides are knotted together, slide the pillow form inside the fleece pillow case. Once it’s inside, knot the 4th side of the pillow case strips together, also using double knots., This project is super-easy and can be completed by kids of just about any age. If the kids are too young, you may need to do the cutting for them, but even young kids can practice tying knots. Plus, you can buy pillow forms of any size as long as you also buy fabric that is 2.5” longer on each side for the knots.Note that ONLY fleece works for a project like this because the edges do not fray.
The same method can be used to make blankets, seat covers, pet beds, etc.

 You must first determine exactly what it is you are trying to prove. This question will also serve as the final statement in the proof. In this step, you also want to define the assumptions that you will be working under. Identifying the question and the necessary assumptions gives you a starting point to understanding the problem and working the proof.;
, When trying to understand the inner working of a math problem, sometimes the easiest way is to draw a diagram of what is happening. Diagrams are particularly important in geometry proofs, as they help you visualize what you are actually trying to prove.


Use the information given in the problem to sketch a drawing of the proof. Label the knowns and unknowns.
As you work through the proof, draw in necessary information that provides evidence for the proof.
 Proofs are difficult to learn to write, but one excellent way to learn proofs is to study related theorems and how those were proved.


Realize that a proof is just a good argument with every step justified. You can find many proofs to study online or in a textbook., It’s perfectly okay to get stuck on a proof. Ask your teacher or fellow classmates if you have questions. They might have similar questions and you can work through the problems together. It’s better to ask and get clarification than to stumble blindly through the proof.


Meet with your teacher out of class for extra instruction.

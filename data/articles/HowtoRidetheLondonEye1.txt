Fast track tickets, which let you jump ahead of the queue and board the Eye more quickly.
Flexi tickets let you visit the London Eye at any time of day rather than booking a specific time in advance.
Combination packages let you save money by combining London Eye tickets with passes for other London attractions, such as the London Dungeon or Madame Tussauds.;
, Visiting the London Eye’s official website will let you buy your ticket ahead of time, saving a bit of wait time. Additionally, you’ll be able to save 10% on the ticket price by paying online. After choosing your package, you’ll be able to pay online with a credit card or PayPal.

After buying your ticket, you’ll have the option to print your ticket at home or collect it at the London Eye. The former will save you more wait time., While it’s more convenient to book tickets online, it’s also possible to queue up at the London Eye for your ticket. You’ll have directions on site as to where to line up to buy your ticket.

Note that while this is possible, it’s usually best to pre book for the London Eye, especially with more exclusive packages.

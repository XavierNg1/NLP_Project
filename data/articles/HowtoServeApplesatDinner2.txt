 One of the easiest ways to have apples for dinner is to make an apple-based salad. Simply dice up an apple and combine it other vegetables, such as red onions, artichokes, and celery.You can also garnish many leafy green salads with an apple to add some sweet or tart flavor. In the summer, you can toss apples with kale, roasted walnuts, and feta cheese., If you are serving a cheese plate appetizer, apple slices can make a great accompaniment. In general, you should try to pair sweeter apples with full-flavored cheeses. Proper pairings will help bring out the flavors of the cheese and the apples.For example, cheddar or bleu cheese pairs well with sweet apples. Brie is also tasty with apples.
 Because of its sweetness, raw apple pairs well with spicy ingredients like jalapeño or poblano peppers. Try adding ingredients like sugar, ginger, and nuts that go well with apples and bring out their flavor. Serve this sweet and spicy appetizer with tortilla or pita chips., For cool fall evenings, apples make for delicious soups. You can sauté apples with other vegetables to create a hearty stew or purée the fruit for creamier soups. If you are in a pinch, you can also use applesauce instead of puréeing your apples.

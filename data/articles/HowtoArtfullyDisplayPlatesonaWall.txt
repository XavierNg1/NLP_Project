 There are various possible types, your choice dependent on what you need, budget, and your color scheme:

The wire wall hanger tends to be the most popular, in brass.
A variation on a basic wall hanger is a plate and cup wall hanger - this allows you to arrange both the plate and the cup together.
White vinyl coated wire plate hanger.
Brass stretch plate hanger.
Heavy duty brass plate hangers. These are suitable for the really large and heavy dishes, including serving dishes.
Adhesive paste-on hangers. These are plastic with stickers on the back. Very good for leaving a mark on your wall but they do remain out of sight.;
, Set them out on a large surface such as a table. Looking at them, consider what design arrangements come to mind. Arrange the plates in this order and stand back to see how it works for you. Make changes until you are satisfied with the result.

Theme arrangements - animal themes, farmyard themes, floral themes, cottage themes, etc.
Plate artist theme
A plate arrangement around an existing or new painting/picture (you might even consider matching the plates and the painting by theme, color, etc.)
Calendar year theme - ideal for the collection of plates that are dated each Christmas; place them in order of receipt either horizontally or vertically on the wall space.
 If you have a small collection, you might add it to the kitchen or eating area. If you have numerous plates, it might be best to place them in different areas of the house, perhaps according to some of the themes suggested above.
 Use a tape measure to ensure that you have the distances between plates even or at least where you'd like the distances to be; mark gently with a pencil. Attach the plate hangers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer your arrangement from the table onto the wall. Stand back and admire!

 Use a sanding sponge to sand away the loose particles around the edges of the dent. Run the sanding sponge over the dent itself to create a rough surface that the joint compound, which is used to fill the dent, will be able to adhere to easily.
 Dip a joint knife sideways into the container of joint compound and load about half of the blade. Run the knife over the dented area to smooth on the joint compound. Turn the blade at a 90 degree angle to the wall and run it over the area again to remove excess compound.


Be sure to remove the extra compound, so that the area won't have bumps once the the substance dries.
Check the area it it dries to determine if the dent has been completely filled. You may need to apply a second coat if the joint compound shrinks as it dries.
 Use a sponge sander or another fine sander to gently blend the area with the surrounding wall space after the joint compound has completely dried. You can also use a dampened sponge to smooth the edges., Joint compounds are relatively porous, so it's necessary to prime the repaired area before you paint it. Otherwise, the paint will look different from the surrounding area.


Use a primer that matches the paint color. If possible, use the same one you originally used to paint the wall.
If you have paint that also acts as a primer, priming the wall first isn't necessary.
 Once the primer is dry, use a soft cloth to paint over the area with the wall paint. Work gently and use strokes similar to the strokes you used to paint the surrounding wall so that the paint will look blended after it has dried.

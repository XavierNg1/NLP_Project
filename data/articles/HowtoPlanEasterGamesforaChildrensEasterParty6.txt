 You will need one egg (raw or hard boiled but hard boiled is best) and one spoon for each person participating in the race. You might even like to use dyed Easter eggs as something special for Easter.
 It's best to have this race on grass or some other soft surface, to give dropped eggs a chance!

, It's no fun dropping your egg, thinking you've won, only to realize that the finish line is in fact several inches or centimeters away.
 Everyone then begins to race towards the finish line. The contestants have to keep their egg balanced in their spoon, without using their other hand for support. If the egg drops, but is not broken, the contestant can pick up the egg and resume the race.
 The first contestant to make it to the finish line wins. Have second and third prizes, too.

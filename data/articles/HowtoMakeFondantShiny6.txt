 Pour 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 ml) of pasteurized egg whites into a small, clean dish. Using a small, soft paintbrush, lightly and evenly brush these egg whites onto the surface of the fondant.


For safety reasons, you should use pre-separated, pasteurized egg whites from a carton.
When working with small pieces, you can dip the fondant directly into the egg whites instead of brushing the egg whites over the piece. Tap off any excess before leaving the piece to dry.
When you need to brush the fondant onto the piece, use a small brush and leave behind as few stroke marks as possible. Tap off any excess egg whites that pool in the crevices of the piece immediately after application.
 Let the egg whites dry for several hours. Once dry, the fondant should have a natural, medium-level shine.


The egg whites must dry completely before you handle the piece. If you touch it while the whites are still drying, you may leave behind fingerprints that you won't be able to remove later.
Note that the egg whites should dry to a semi-hard, permanent finish. Re-application should not be necessary.
 If the fondant is not as shiny as you would prefer, you can apply additional coats following the same procedure.


Allow each coat to finish drying before applying the next coat. Doing so minimizes the risk of imprinting the egg whites with fingerprints or brush marks.

 For this you’ll need a loose case, which you can make out of smooth paper or something fragile, like tissue paper. For the filling, you’ll need snappers (or “pop” rocks) and magnesium powder.


You can find magnesium powder at some hobby shops and online. Be sure you stay away from magnesium citrate, which is a health supplement.
 On a sheet of paper combine the snappers with the magnesium. For a decent smoke bomb you’ll need three to four snappers and a teaspoon of magnesium powder., Finish up the process by wrapping the two ingredients in the casing of your choice. You can simply use tissue paper if you can’t find anything in the house. Once cased, seal the mixture so that it is tight. Once you’re done throw it on a hard surface and you should see a flash, bang and smoke!


You can use tape or glue to seal the smoke bomb.

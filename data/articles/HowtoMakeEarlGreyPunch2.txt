 Earl Grey rum punch is a fruity and tropical spin on an Early Grey punch.

Soaking the tea leaves in the rum infuses the rum with the flavor of Earl Grey., Place a fine mesh strainer over a 2 cup (473.18 ml) measuring cup, then pour the rum through the strainer so that all the tea leaves are caught in the strainer., Pour the ¼ cup (59.15 ml) pineapple juice, 2 tablespoons (9.86 ml) apricot liqueur, 1 tablespoon (14.79 ml) lime juice , 1 tablespoon (14.79 ml) lemon juice, 2 teaspoons (9.86 ml) Simple Syrup and 2 dashes of angostura bitters into the measuring cup along with the infused rum., Pour ice into a pitcher or into 2 cocktail glasses, then pour the punch over the ice.

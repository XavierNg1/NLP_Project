 If you have some double sided tape stuck to your window, you cannot use heat or you will risk cracking the glass. You also can't use anything too abrasive, or you will risk scratching the glass. Instead, you will need to dissolve the tape using oil. Here is a list of what you will need:


Butter knife (you can also use your fingernail)
Window cleaner
Sponge and glass scrub
Cooking oil or cleaning oil (mineral oil, Goo Gone, etc)
Rubbing alcohol

, You can do this by picking at one of the corners with your fingernail. You can also use a butter knife or pallet knife, but take care so that you do not scratch the glass.
 If you do not have any window cleaner, you can make your own by mixing together 2 cups (275 milliliters) of water, Â¼ cup (60 milliliters) of vinegar, and a few drops of liquid soap.
 This will help dislodge some of the stuck-on residue. If your sponge has two sides (a soft side and an abrasive side) try using the scratchy side.
 If the glass cleaner or vinegar solution did not remove the tape, you will need to saturate it with some cooking oil (such as olive oil) or a cleaning oil (such as Goo Gone or Goof Off). Spray the oil onto the affected area and buff it with the sponge until there is no more residue.
 Soak a soft cloth with rubbing alcohol and rub it until you have removed all tape and oil residue.









If there is still some tape left, buff it again with a glass-safe scrubbing sponge soaked in oil, and then clean it again using rubbing alcohol. The rubbing oil will get rid of the oil residue and evaporate, leaving no marks.

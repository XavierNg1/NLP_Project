, Design your fur so that it's either dusty brown, dark brown, orange, white, black, blue, silver, or tortoiseshell, which is a calico. Your eyes can be any color except pink or purple. Brown, green and dark-blue eyes suit well if you are a kit. For higher ranks, black, orange and yellow is recommended since it looks scarier.

 They eat mostly mice, voles, squirrels, rabbit , birds such as starlings, magpies, wood pigeons, blackbirds, and thrushes.
 They are the only clan to bunch their hindquarters before leaping to catch prey. They also hide in bushes, trees, and also, they blend in well with the ground. They have the sense to keep upwind of their prey. ThunderClan only eats frogs and fish when they have to, or if they are politely offered by another clan.

 You can begin with a milder method, or start with this one if you don’t want to take your chances on leaving the stain for too long. It’s also an option to use a clear alcohol, like vodka, if you don’t have isopropyl alcohol around. Just try not to drink any of it while you clean., Don’t start working on the stain just yet. Instead, find a hidden or small spot on the wood floor. Dab the cloth on a very small spot to make sure it doesn’t damage the wood. If it does, abandon this method now. It’s okay. There’s another way to remove the stain.It is still an option to use the alcohol even if it does slightly discolor the wood. You could just sand it down and go over the floor with a wood stain to make it like new again.
 Use the cloth that has been dampened with isopropyl alcohol to begin scrubbing off the stain. You’ll know the alcohol is working if the stain begins to transfer to the cloth. Continue to scrub until the stain is gone and relief begins to wash over you., Once the stain has been scrubbed off, rinse off the wood. You can pour some water on the wood and dry it off with a towel. Or, wet a fresh cloth and then let the wood air dry. You’re done! Sit back and relax.

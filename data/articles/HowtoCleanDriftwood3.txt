 This is one of the quicker ways to sterilize driftwood found in nature. Place the driftwood in a pot filled with boiling water. Keep the driftwood boiling for 1-2 hours. You may need to refill the water as it boils away. When the time is up, drain the water out, replace it, and repeat the process.Many aquarists like this method as it is virtually guaranteed to kill any fungal spores found on the driftwood., Get out a cookie sheet and cover it with foil. Place your driftwood pieces on the foil, not overlapping. Bake the wood at 200 degrees for 2-4 hours. You will want to closely monitor this process to ensure that the wood does not start to singe or burn. When finished, set the wood aside and allow it to cool., If you donâ€™t want to bother with extensive cleaning methods and if you plan to use your wood for a project, you might consider simply applying a varnish or coating to the wood as is. Any grains present on the wood will lead to an uneven finish, but the coating itself will sanitize the wood to some extent.

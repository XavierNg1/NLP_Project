 Add the oil to your skillet and heat it over medium-high to high.


The oil should not begin to smoke, but if a few drops of water are splashed into the pan, they should immediately sizzle and evaporate into steam upon contact.
 Button mushrooms need to be gently cleaned and cut before cooking them.


Wipe each mushroom clean with a damp paper towel or moist, clean washcloth. Focus on the surface of each mushroom.
Button mushrooms can be left whole, if desired, or cut into halves, quarters, or slices using a sharp kitchen knife.
 Let the mushrooms sit and cook in the hot oil for roughly 2 minutes, or until you see that the bottoms have begun to caramelize.


Do not toss the mushrooms before they reach this stage of the cooking process. If you do, they will begin to steam, which is a sign that the have begun to release and lose liquid.
 After the bottoms caramelize, you should use a heat-resistant spatula to continually stir and flip the button mushrooms until they just begin to brown on all sides.
 Toss the butter into the skillet and stir it together with the mushrooms until you think that all the mushrooms have been coated. Continue cooking, stirring continually.


When done, the mushrooms should all be evenly and well browned on all sides.
 Add salt, to taste, and the minced garlic. Continue cooking for another 2 minutes to infuse the mushrooms with the flavor.


Stir the mushrooms frequently as they cook.
 Stir the ingredients into the mushrooms, coating them well. Cook for several more minutes or until the liquid has been mostly evaporated.


Note that you can substitute chicken broth for the white wine, if necessary. The wine will deglaze the pan better and will impart a richer flavor, but the broth is an acceptable alternative.
 Remove the cooked button mushrooms from the heat and toss with the chopped parsley. Serve the mushrooms immediately as a side dish.

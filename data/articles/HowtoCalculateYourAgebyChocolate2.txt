 That’s the starting point for figuring out your age by chocolate.


This number should be more than one time per week but less than 10 times per week.You could choose 1 or 10, too.As an example, let’s use the number “7.” Figuring out someone’s age by chocolate is what is known as a parlor trick. It uses complexity to hide an outcome that is actually very simple.
Try to be realistic here. How many times per week do you really want to have chocolate?

, You take whichever number of times you want to have chocolate per week and multiply it by 2. So far, so good!


To continue our example, you would multiply 7 X 2 = 14.
To use another example, let’s say that you said you wanted to have chocolate 3 times per week. Then, you would take 3 X 2 = 6.
To repeat: Whichever number you picked for the number of times per week you want to have chocolate, you should multiply by 2. It’s a simple mathematical equation. Feel free to use a calculator if you need to, but so far you should be able to do the equations in your head.
 This means you should add 5 to whatever running total you have. It helps to write all of this down on a piece of paper as you go along.


To use our first example, which started with 7, you now have 19. That’s because 14 + 5 = 19.
To use the example starting with 3, you would now have 11. That’s because 6 + 5 = 11.
If you are good at basic math, you should be able to easily calculate your age by chocolate. If not, grab the calculator. This is a fun way for children to master basic math equations, though.

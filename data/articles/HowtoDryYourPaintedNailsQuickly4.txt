 The thinner coats on your nails will dry faster than a thick one. Thin coats will evaporate faster. Instead of applying one thick coat, try to apply a thin coat and wait for a minute or two for it to dry. Then add another coat and repeat until you reach your desired manicure.
 If you start with clean nail beds and cuticles, your nail polish will adhere better and dry faster. Start your manicure with healthy hands and your manicure will look more stunning.
 While it may not help your nails dry quicker, it will help your manicure last longer. Use a thin top coat to dry quicker, and your beautiful manicure will last longer than if you hadnâ€™t.

 Time management is the key to covering the ground in any kind of examination effectively. While writing a competitive examination, be more careful with your time. After allocating a bit of time for revising, distribute the rest of the time to the questions to be answered.
 Don't allocate more time to any of the questions than is needed. If you are not getting the answers even after the stipulated time suitable for that question, don't spend any more time on that question; instead, move on. Proceed to the next question and remember to come back if you have time., That way you will have more time for questions covering subject-matter you are less familiar with. Always follow the pattern of answering the questions that you know really well first, then proceeding to the questions that you don't know that well., Take care when answering multiple questions. Most often the competitive exams contain multiple choice questions. You need to be extra careful while answering multiple choice questions. Read the questions thoroughly, taking care to not miss important points.

Read through the options. Select the one which is the most apt. Sometimes options are given in such a way that two of the options may look similar. In that case, be sure to choose the correct one, knowing that the similarity is on purpose. Take extra care while choosing such an option.
 Go back through all the questions after completing the exam. That way, you can decide which questions should be answered first and how much time needs to be spend on each article., Though you have carefully answered the questions, faults may occur. The final half hour of the exam should be dedicated to revising the answers. Look if you have missed any of the questions that you know.

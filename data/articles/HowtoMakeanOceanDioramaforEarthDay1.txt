 Your theme will determine what fish, mammals and shapes you will want to include. For example, you can choose to depict an endangered whale pod, an ecological disaster, a local bay or an aquatic sport.


Many schools choose an Earth Day theme, such as "Taking the Next Step," "Environmental Progress," "Do your Part," or "Clean Watersheds, Clean Water." If this is the case, research an ocean setting that will address the theme and then plan your setting.;
, Choose between a shoe box, a sardine tin or a cookie tin. The container will determine the size of your diorama and how big its features should be.
 Draw the container shape and sketch out possible shapes and creatures in pencil. Assign layers to your drawing, including background, mid-level and foreground.
 If you are using a box, cut off the flaps and wipe out the inside with a tack cloth. If you are using a tin, wash it with soap and water and dry it completely.

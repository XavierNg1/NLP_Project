 Swimming with a pad on isn't necessarily your best option. Pads are designed to absorb liquid, so they will absorb the pool water as well. If you can, use a tampon or a menstrual cup instead.If you don't use a tampon or menstrual cup, you may want to avoid getting your bottom suit wet. If you're at the beach, do some paddling and wading instead of going in all the way. If you're at the pool, consider sitting by the side with your legs in. If you want to go all the way in the water, your best bet is to use a tampon or a menstrual cup.;
, When you are ready to go swimming, take off your pad or liner that you are currently wearing.
 Take it out of the wrapper and stick the back of it onto your bathing suit bottom. Make sure it's a thin one so that it doesn't bulge, and make sure you're wearing a suit that fits snugly to your body. If your pad gets wet, it won't be as sticky anymore, so wearing a tighter suit can help keep it in place.
, This will help disguise any bulge from your wet pad, and if the material is dark, it will help hide any leakage as well.
 For maximum comfort and hygiene, just stick to paddling and water depths below your waist. If your pad does get wet, it will get soaked with water, so step out of the pool carefully and have a towel handy to cover up the signs of a wet pad.

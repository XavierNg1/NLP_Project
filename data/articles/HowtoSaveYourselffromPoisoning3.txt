 You will likely be hooked up to monitors for continual evaluation of your vital signs, as the doctors identify and treat the cause of your poisoning.


You may need to receive IV fluids, have oxygen delivered via nasal prongs, or receive other medical support to ensure that your vital signs do not get into a dangerous range.
 What this does is it inhibits further absorption of the toxic substance through your intestine. It depends upon the cause of your poisoning whether or not this is effective. In certain cases, if administered soon enough after ingestion, activated charcoal can save your life.


If you throw up the activated charcoal, you must, unfortunately, take another dose.
 Once the cause of your poisoning has been confirmed, your doctor can then administer any antidotes to reverse the effects of the poison, if a specific antidote exists for your form of poisoning. If not, your doctor will treat you on a symptom basis, giving you medication as needed to keep you safe until you recover.

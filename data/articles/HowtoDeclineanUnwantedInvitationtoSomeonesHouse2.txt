 Keep it short and perhaps use humor or abbreviations.


Use the acronym SICMI. This means "sorry i can't make it". If they ask, you simply reply with what it means.
 The point of texting is to be short and sweet/ You simply say, "Thanks but I can't come. Thanks though! Appreciate it!" It's simple!

 The type of event and the number of guests present should definitely factor in to how much you decide to spend per bottle of Champagne or sparkling wine.


An intimate dinner or small gathering will enable you think about selecting an exclusive bottle or two of Champagne (ranging upwards of $100 per bottle). Well known producers of these high-end Champagnes include Dom Perignon, Louis Roederer Cristal, and Krug.
For a larger party or wedding, sparkling wine may be a better option because of a wider variety of price points. Although a quality Champagne can be purchased for approximately $40, many well regarded Proseccos or Cavas are available for less than that. If a large quantity is being purchased, ask the merchant whether a bulk discount is available.
 If the Champagne or sparkling wine is going to be added to a cocktail or punch, consider purchasing a less expensive American sparkling wine.
 Price varies depending on the amount of Champagne being purchased.


A typical bottle of Champagne or sparkling wine is 750 milliliters.
Smaller, half-bottle sizes of expensive brands enable you to sample them without making the financial commitment to the regular size bottle.
A 1.5 liter Magnum may be a fun option for a party. But remember, although a Magnum has double the amount of sparkling wine found in a typical bottle, it is usually more than twice as expensive due to material and shipping costs.

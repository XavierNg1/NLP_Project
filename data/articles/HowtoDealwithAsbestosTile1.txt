 If an asbestos containing tile is undamaged, you should leave it intact. The fibers are considered non-friable as long as the piece is intact, but if the piece is damaged the fibers could become airborne. You should only remove the asbestos tile if it is damaged.

, If you find that there is no sign of damage, then you should leave the tile as is. Busting it up to remove it will only cause asbestos fibers to be released into the environment.

This means that you will greatly reduce the risk of asbestos fibers getting into the air. The added bonus is that you save time and money by leaving your original floor intact.

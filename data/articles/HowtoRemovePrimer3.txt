 Use a single-sided razor blade to carefully scrape away excess primer from the surface of the cloth.


Hold the razor blade at an angle so that it just barely points inward toward the fabric.
Scrape away the primer, working in one direction, until you've lifted away as much as possible. Work slowly and carefully to avoid ripping the fabric.
 Make a cleaning solution by combining one part liquid hand dishwashing detergent with one part cool water.


The exact amount necessary will vary depending on the size of the stain, but you should prepare enough to thoroughly soak the stained area.
 Soak a sponge in the detergent solution, then use it to vigorously tamp and blot at the stain.


Do not scrub the stain since doing so may cause it to spread deeper into the fibers of the material.
 After working on the stain for several minutes, rinse the material under cool water.


Work from the back side of the fabric, if possible, and rinse until the water runs clear.
 If parts of the stain still remain, continue sponging it away with the same detergent solution.


Repeat as needed until the stain disappears or until you no longer notice any additional progress.



As before, you should only blot the stain and not scrub it.
Do not use acetone on fabrics containing acetate or triacetate.
 Rinse away the acetone with cool water.


Continue rinsing until the water runs clear.
Do not use the acetone more than once. If you need to work on the fabric further, return to the detergent solution.

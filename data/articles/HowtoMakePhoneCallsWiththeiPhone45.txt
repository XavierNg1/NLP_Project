You can also press and hold the center button on the iPhone earphones to use Voice Control.
 To dial a number, make sure to say each digit separately (for example: eight-five-eight, five-five-five, two-one-three-two).

For best results, speak the full name of the person you’re calling, and be sure to specify which number you'd like to dial. (examples would be: Call John Appleseed… Call John Appleseed at home, or… Call John Appleseed, mobile) If you speak only the first name and you have more than one contact with that name, iPhone asks which of those contacts you want to call.






Note: For an “800” area code in the U.S., you can say “eight hundred.”

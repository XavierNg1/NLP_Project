 Medium to dark washes tend to look best with the dark hue of combat boots. You could also wear black skinny jeans to create a slightly dressier look while elongating your leg, but for casual daytime wear, standard blue will work better. Skinny jeans work best so that you can tuck the jeans into your boots. Jeans with wider legs tend to bunch up, and this look works best if you can wear the boots on the outside of your jeans.
 A fitted t-shirt or tank top creates a very casual look that is suitable for an ordinary day around the town. If you want to go for something a little more special, you could opt for a fitted blouse or button-down shirt. A plain color works well, but a bold pattern in a vibrant color can also make a fashionable statement.
 You do not need to wear anything over your top, but if you do decide to, opt for something a little more casual instead of something dressy. A cardigan, for instance, is too formal for this look, but a poncho or casual capelet will work just fine.Hooded sweatshirts, on the other hand, might be a little too casual.
 While worn combat boots are certainly casual, they might actually be a little too casual for this already simple outfit. The purpose here is not to create contrast, but to go for a cohesive look that is simply a little sturdier than one you might create with heels or sneakers. Worn boots will only make your attire look sloppy.
 If you decide to wear make-up, keep it light and daytime appropriate. As far as accessories go, look for solid colors, clean lines, and simple shapes. Consider a solid bangle bracelet, a simple satchel-style over-the-shoulder purse, or large post earrings.

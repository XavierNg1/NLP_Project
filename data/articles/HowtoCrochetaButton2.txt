 Create an adjustable ring, more commonly known as a "magic ring," with your yarn. Make one chain stitch to secure the loop.
 Make two more chain stitches from the loop on your crochet hook. Work eleven double crochets into the loop of the magic ring. Gently tug on the ends of the magic ring to close it into a tight circle.


Note that the initial set of two chain stitches will be counted as a single double crochet.
Your circle should have 12 double crochet stitches in it, including your set of two chain stitches.
 Cut the yarn, leaving a long tail, and pull this tail through the loop on your hook to tie it off.


The tail should be at least 8 inches (20.32 cm) long.
 Insert the tail end of the yarn into the eye of a darning needle, loosely tying the end of the yarn onto the needle to hold it on.


Alternatively, you could just hold the end of the yarn in place with your fingertip instead of tying it on.
 Insert the darning needle through the top of your first double crochet and back out through the back loop of the last stitch.


Note that you need to weave it into your first actual double crochet, not through the starting set of two chains.
This should create the appearance of an extra stitch and create a clean appearance with a round edge from the front.
 Use your darning needle to weave the tail end into the stitches along the back of the button, securing it while simultaneously hiding it.

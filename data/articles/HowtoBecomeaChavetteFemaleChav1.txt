 These are a 'must have' favourite - particularly among chubby Chavettes (usually young mums aged between 14 and 25). Remember in summer to get your toes out. Chavettes love to show their dirty, badly fake-tanned feet in their Primark Â£1.99 sandals.;
, Chavs were once known to have long hair tied into a side ponytail or bun, but now, it has been updated. Be addicted to your hair straighteners. You can never be too Chav to straighten your hair. Dye your hair either bleached blonde, jet black (classic Chavette!) or that magenta colour that has since been made popular amongst Chavettes by well-known X Factor celebrities.
 Foundation is a must and should be reapplied frequently throughout the day - a nice tangerine/orange complexion is a Chavette staple, as is a ridiculous fake-tan. Blusher isn't usually used (much too healthy looking) and neither is a coloured lipstick. Stick to a death-pale concealer on the lips or death-pale lipstick - even better make it a white shade. Apply liberally.
 Chav Etiquette calls on how one must look as rich as possible, even though this ironically makes them look really poor. Gold earrings from Argos were once a firm must, but now the "Cash for Gold" shops have spread around Great Britain like wildfire - so Chavs have resorted to selling off their Argos Gold jewellery (as well as Gold family heirloom jewellery - stolen from their grandmother's house and other pensioners) for a few quid, thus the Chav-style has evolved onto Primark Gold, Primark gold being fake - as with any highstreet jewellery. Highstreet Jewellery isn't 'Chav' - but wearing lots of it at the same time is. Layer it, wear as much jewellery as much as possible, and remember fake diamonds should be heavily embellished on belts, hats, and belt-buckles etc.

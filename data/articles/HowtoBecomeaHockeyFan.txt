 They could be in the NHL, AHL, ECHL, WHL, basically anything short that ends with 'HL'.;
, Maybe go for the team closest to where you live or maybe your hometown. You decide.
 Even though you're a fan, it's a plus when meeting people later on that you know the basics, such as an Icing, Off-sides, Roughing, Boarding, High Sticking, Slashing, etc. Also, and this is a huge plus, you will be able to yell at the television (or radio) when the refs make an unfair call.
 Usually your home team will have one on their website, and most have them available to print. These are great for your computer area, your office, or your bedroom.
 Depending on your area, NHL Hockey might be with your standard cable or satellite, call ahead to check. The current 'big' channels in Hockey are Fox Sports Net, Versus, NESN, and TSN, CBC, CSN, CN8, MSG and RDS.
 Most cities have fan-based clubs or groups that go to games together, chat on the internet, and share the love of the sport.
 Your first hockey game, this is the event that you have been waiting, training, preparing for this whole time. I advise that you purchase a Third Level seat, these are surprisingly cheap and they offer a great view of the game, despite what you might think.
 This is recommended, but its not required. A lot of fans get their jerseys 'personalized' with the name and number of their favorite player on it. Don't be afraid to shell out $100 or more on these, they do last a lifetime.
 From here you can purchase mini/season ticket plans, tailgate before games, stay after games for autographs, the list goes on! Enjoy the sport, and enjoy the game.

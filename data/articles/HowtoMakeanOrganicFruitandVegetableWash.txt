 You can use a normal lemon, which would be slightly cheaper, but the wash couldn't be called "organic", just "natural". Regardless, both kinds of lemons will be fine for the task.



Slice the lemon in half.
Squeeze out one tablespoon of lemon juice into the spray bottle. The lemon juice is both a natural disinfectant and will leave your fruits and vegetables smelling nice.;
, The vinegar provides some additional disinfectant power.
 Shake the mixture vigorously.
 After each spray, rinse it off. They're now ready to eat or use in cooking.

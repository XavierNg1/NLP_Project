 If you don't know your material ahead of time, you will have less to contribute and will understand the discussion less. Research some background information on your topic if you are given it ahead of time.;
, You need to trust yourself and others and you need to feel confident in your thoughts. Share your opinions- it doesn't matter what other people think as long as your thoughts matter to you.
 Some will say no, they have unprotected sex and spread AIDS around, but people who know prostitutes will object or live in a building that has one. But they have a living besides prostitution. The group discussions are mostly a way to see if how people's views are different, and how they perceive things. It's also comparing answers to others.
 So take in all in stride and try to form a question about why such an argument bursts out from something misunderstood. Try to make sure that their anger simmered down, and make a light-humored topic to stay. Compare comedy to the comedy back then, with all the custard pies thrown, and chases, it's a good way to diminish the tense atmosphere.
 This allows your view to be heard, and thought upon. There has to be flaws, obviously, or else it wouldn't be a good debate. That is probably the main problem, where the topic is perfect to discuss about. Instead of finding the boring, flawless debate, find one that you never heard of. It'll be enough to research, and enjoy. It also might be something educational, not the regular question from teachers about whether school uniforms should be allowed.
 Ranging arithmetic, charities, healthy eating, politics, sports, and virtue or value in today's products. Mainly, you got to wonder if that topic is worth talking about, for politics, it varies; there is the government, and what they control. It's challenging, but group discussion is an opening to your lives. An introduction for you to get to know each other. Good luck in starting it...

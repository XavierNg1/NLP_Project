 Look for one that is just slightly wider and deeper than the root ball of the plant you are going to pot. Be sure to use a gardenia variety suitable for pot growing so that the gardenia doesn't outgrow the container.
 Choose a good houseplant potting mix without added fertilizer to fill the pot. Make sure the potting mix states that the pH is below 6. Place enough of the potting mix in the pot so that the top of the root ball will be about 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) below the rim.
 Mix it well so there are no dry pockets.
 Fill in around the gardenia with potting soil to the top of the root ball.
 Mix an acidic water soluble fertilizer formulated for gardenias as directed on the package for potted plants. Water the pot with the fertilizer solution until water drains from the bottom.
 There should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between the pot rim and the top of the planting medium in the pot.
 Potted gardenias are perfect for sunny porches or patios. Make sure the pot isn't too shaded, or the gardenia won't bloom.
 Potted gardenias only need to be watered once a week. Give the gardenia a good inch of water on the same morning each week. Water the roots, not the leaves, to keep the sun from burning the plant.
 If you live in a cool place, you'll need to overwinter the gardenia inside. Before the first frost in the fall, bring the pot inside and put it in a sunny, humid room. If the air in your house is dry, and it probably is, run a humidifier in the room with the gardenia to keep humidity high enough for the plant. It may also help to set the pot on a tray filled with pebbles and water

, Gardenias will slowly outgrow their pots after about 2 years. Buy a larger pot and repot your gardenia to keep it healthy.

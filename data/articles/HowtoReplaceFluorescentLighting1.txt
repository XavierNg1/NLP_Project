 Before replacing a fluorescent light, you should make sure the fixture is not powered on. Do not simply use the wall switch to remove power to the fixture. You can use the fuse box to shut off power to the lamp's circuit. Use a voltage tester to verify that there is no power in the fixture.

, Most likely, you will not be able to reach the fluorescent light fixture comfortably from ground level. Position a stepladder underneath the fixture to replace the lamps comfortably and safely.
 Reach up, and gently support the first fluorescent tube with both hands, keeping your hands as close to the ends of the bulb as possible. You will be able to rotate the tube in either direction a quarter-turn until it stops. This action rotates the prongs, that project from each end of the bulb, to a vertical alignment, and so allows you to slide the tube downward and out of the fixture.
 Place the tube gently out of the way, where it cannot roll or be disturbed.
 To install the new light, line its prongs up with the slots in either socket. Push the tube straight up into the sockets, and then rotate it 90 degrees until you feel it lock into place. You can give the lamp a gentle tug to ensure that it is firmly in place.
 Most often, fluorescent light fixtures are designed with two tubes side-by-side. The process for replacing each tube is the same.
 Flip the fuse box switch back on, then flip your wall switch on. See if the new fluorescent bulbs light up properly, noting that fluorescent lamps take a minute or so to reach full brightness. If the new bulbs do not work properly, you may have a defective component in your light fixture that needs to be replaced.

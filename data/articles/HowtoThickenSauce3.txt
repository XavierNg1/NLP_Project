 Beurre manié is French for kneaded butter, because you knead the butter and flour together. Using a fork or your fingers, knead the flour and butter together until a smooth paste or dough is formed.


You can use a food processor for larger quantities of beurre manié.
Beurre manié is an ideal way to thicken savory soups, gravies, and sauces.
 These portions will be added one at a time to whatever you are thickening.
 Whisk one ball of butter dough into your sauce at a time. For every ball you add, allow the sauce to simmer for at least one minute, giving it time to thicken, before adding another ball. Add balls of beurre manié like this until your sauce reaches the desired consistency.Leftover balls of beurre manié can be stored in the freezer for future use. Be sure to thaw to room temperature before adding to a sauce.

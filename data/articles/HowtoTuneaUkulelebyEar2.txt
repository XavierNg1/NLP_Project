 You can tune the ukulele with nothing but the instrument and your ears. Each string contains all 12 notes. You can use one tuned string to tune another string. It is all about knowing where the notes are on the frets.


Frets are the metal wires that go along the neck. You create different notes by pressing your fingers right above the frets., Once you’ve tuned the G string, you should be able to tune the rest of the ukulele to match the G string. Play the fifth fret on the G string; this is a C. Play both the fifth fret on the G string and the open C string. Tune the C string downwards and then tune upwards until the two strings are in tune.


Take some time and use your ears to help you determine what sounds identical.
You aren’t using your ears to make the strings sound good together, but instead matching the strings., Play the 4th fret on the C string. This is the E string. Play both strings as you did with the C string. Listen to determine if the strings are in tune. If not, adjust the open E string until it matches the other string perfectly.


Pluck the fourth fret on the C string and then pluck the open E string. It helps to pause between plucking the two strings to hear the distinction.
 The final string will also be tuned in the same fashion. The A note is located on the fifth fret of the E string. Play the fifth fret of the E string and then play the A string. Again, it will help to tune down, or lower in pitch, a ways and match the note while tuning upwards., The best way to test the tuning is by playing a chord, such as a C major chord. The only note you need to hold down with your fingers is the third fret of the A string. Play the chord once and decide if it sounds in tune.


If something sounds off, play each string in the chord position until you isolate the out of tune string.
You can also use a tuner to double check if everything is in tune.

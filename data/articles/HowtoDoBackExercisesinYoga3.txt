 One of the most well-known yoga poses, downward facing dog gives your back and upper legs the chance to stretch and lengthen. This pose enables a deep, easy stretch especially in your lower back, making it a great way to start cooling down from the more challenging poses.
 By doing this pose you'll improve your coordination as well as support for your upper body. This pose requires attention to balance, so be careful not to overexert yourself if you are new to yoga. If you are struggling to maintain the position, keep your hands in prayer position and push them together to find your center of balance.

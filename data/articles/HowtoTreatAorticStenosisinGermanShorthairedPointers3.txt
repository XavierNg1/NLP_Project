 In dogs with mild or moderate aortic stenosis, veterinary treatment is typically not performed. Such cases can usually be controlled with lifestyle changes. Basically, you will need to control your dog's activity level to adjust for its decreased ability to get sufficient oxygen.


Dogs with a mild case tend to have a good prognosis and live a generally typical lifespan. However, exercise regimes may need to be curtailed depending on the dogâ€™s tolerance to exercise.
For example, a German shorthaired pointer that is expected to be a hunting dog may not be able to perform at maximal efficiency. However, it can still engage in some restricted form of hunting sport, as long as its heart health is closely monitored.
 If your dog is diagnosed with aortic stenosis, the dog's heart health will need to be monitored for the rest of its life. Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for when and how often your dog should be brought in for checkups or treatment.If your dog is on medication for its aortic stenosis, then a checkup is important so that its veterinarian can adjust its medication.
Getting good veterinary care is key to your German shorthaired pointer living a long and relatively healthy life with aortic stenosis.
 If your dog has been diagnosed with aortic stenosis, even if it is a very mild case that does not require medication, episodes of fainting or difficulty breathing are very serious. Take your dog to its veterinarian immediately if this happens.Even if your dog recovers quickly from difficulty breathing or a fainting spell, it still needs to be seen by a veterinarian immediately.

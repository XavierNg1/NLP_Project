 Your doctor can prescribe an antiperspirant containing aluminum chloride, which plugs the sweat glands. Prescribed antiperspirants are stronger and much more effective than antiperspirants you can buy over the counter. Apply it at night just before you go to sleep and wash it off in the morning., Oxybutynin and glycopyrrolate are anticholinergics: drugs which inhibit the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, thereby inhibiting the nerve impulses that trigger sweating.This can help reduce sweating of the palms and other areas of your body. Studies show improvement in over 80% of patients, with limited side effects.Side effects may include blurred vision, dry mouth, and difficulty sleeping.
 Iontophoresis uses a weak electric current passed through water or a wet pad to temporarily shut down the sweat glands. It is effective at reducing sweating in 50-75% of cases.Treatment sessions last 20 to 30 minutes. You will need 2 to 3 a week at first to shut down the sweat glands.Once you see results, you will need to repeat treatment as necessary, typically between once a week and once a month.You can be treated at your dermatologistâ€™s office, or purchase an at home iontophoresis kit for $200-1000. Your insurance company may cover the cost if you don't respond to other treatments.
 A number of injections are given to the palms. This should only be done by a trained physician. Botox treatment has been shown to be highly effective, significantly reducing sweat production in 84% of individuals after 1 week, 76% after a month, and 50% after 6 months.Botox injections are more effective and last longer than iontophoresis. Although, you will need to receive the injections every 3-6 months.
However, the potential side effects, though usually short lived, are more serious, including possible pain at the site of injections, nausea, and compensatory sweating on other areas of the body.

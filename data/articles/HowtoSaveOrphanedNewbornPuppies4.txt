 Because puppies cannot regulate their own body temperature, they may quickly lose heat and become cold. If you notice a puppy shivering or if their skin is cold to the touch, slowly warm them using your own body heat. Hold them close to you in your hands.The puppy will start to wiggle and move around when they are warm enough.
Do not feed a cold puppy milk. Warm them slowly before feeding.
Warming a puppy too quickly can send them into shock.
 Low blood sugar might occur in puppies who are not nursing from their mother. You may notice that the puppies are weak, limp, or cold. They may have bluish gums or twitching muscles. Take affected puppies to the vet to have dextrose administered to them., If the puppy has dry skin or sticky gums in the mouth, they may be dehydrated. You can prevent this by feeding the puppy regularly and providing a humid environment. If the puppy is severely dehydrated, take them to a vet immediately.Loss of skin elasticity is a major sign of dehydration. To check for this, pinch the puppyâ€™s skin. If it sticks and does not return to normal, they may be dehydrated.
 It is often recommended that puppies be dewormed for roundworm and hookworm beginning at two weeks. This first round should be followed up with subsequent dewormings at four, six, and eight weeks of age.Your vet will most likely give the puppy a shot that kills any worms living inside the puppy. Oral medication is also sometimes used.
 Puppies are usually vaccinated for the first time between six and eight weeks of age. Puppies typically receive shots for distemper, parainfluenza, and bordetella at this time.Orphaned puppies may be especially vulnerable to parvo if they did not receive enough colostrum, the early mother's milk that bolsters the immune system. The vet may decide to vaccinate them for parvo at five weeks of age, especially if it is a significant risk in your region.

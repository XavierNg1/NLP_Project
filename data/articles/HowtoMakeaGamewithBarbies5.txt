 Don't wait too long, but wait long enough for you to regain interest in the game.
 You could go with what you had been doing before, whether it be a plan or just improvised actions.
 You won't be able to continue the game unless you play it.
 If you're stuck at a certain point in your Barbie's lives, you could always skip a few game years and try again at another time.
 If you've completely lost interest, just start over. You could use the same characters or completely restart.

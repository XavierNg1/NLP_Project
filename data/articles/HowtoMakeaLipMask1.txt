 For this simple mask, you will need enough raw honey to cover your lips, a small spatula or spoon, and some plastic wrap. This mask is great for those with dry or chapped lips.;
, You will be covering your lips with this, so make sure that it is large enough to cover your entire mouth.
 This is to prevent any food residue from mixing in with your mask.
 You can also use your fingers, as long as they are very clean. You want a nice, thick layer of honey over your lips, but not so thick that it drips down your chin.
 Make sure that your hands are clean, then gently press the plastic wrap over the honey. This will help trap all the heat and moisture.
 Honey is a natural moisturizer, so leaving it on your lips for so long will allow it to hydrate your lips, leaving them feeling soft and silky.
 Gently peel the plastic wrap off; it if is sticking to your skin, then try using some warm water to help dissolve the honey. Once you have the plastic wrap off, rinse your lips with some warm water and gently pat them dry with a soft, clean towel. If there is any honey stuck to your skin, then you can remove it using a gentle facial cleanser.

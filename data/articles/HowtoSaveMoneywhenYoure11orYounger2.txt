 You cannot save what you don't have, so getting an income source is an important part of saving well.
 While you may or may not get pocket money for regular chores, it is a good idea to find chores that are not on your regular to-do list and then ask if you can get some extra money for doing them. Examples of chores that might go beyond your usual routine (and therefore deserve additional money) include:


Cleaning out the refrigerator
Cleaning the toilet
Clearing away leaves from the yard
Weeding the garden
Touch-ups to flaking house paint, or paint on fences
Mowing the lawn
Washing the windows (inside and out)
Spring cleaning (any time of year).
 You are more likely to be successful in getting extra money if adults are aware of your savings motivation.

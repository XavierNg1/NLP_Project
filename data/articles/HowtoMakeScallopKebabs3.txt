 Add ¼ cup (55 g) of melted butter, 1 ½ teaspoons (3 g) of Old Bay seasoning, and ½ teaspoon (½ g) of dried parsley leaves to a small bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they are fully combined.If you prefer, you can substitute olive oil for the butter.
 Take 1 pound (454 g) of sea scallops and thread approximately 5 on each of 8 6-inch (15-cm) wooden skewers. Next, set the kabobs in a shallow baking dish that’s been lined with foil.To keep the skewers from burning, soak them in water for at least 30 minutes before cooking the kabobs.
 Once the kabobs are in the baking dish, use a basting brush to spread the seasoned butter all over the scallops. Put the scallops in the oven to broil for approximately 6 to 8 minutes, or until they are opaque.Make sure to turn the kabobs at least once while they’re broiling so they cook evenly on both sides.
Add more of the seasoned butter to the kabobs periodically during the broiling process.
Scallops cook pretty quickly, so keep an eye on the kabobs while they’re cooking to ensure that you don’t overcook them.
 When the scallops are finished broiling, remove the baking pan from the oven. Allow them to cool for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a platter and serving.Serve the scallop kabobs with grilled vegetables, potato salad, or a green salad.

 The amount of dish soap you’ll use depends on how dirty the iron is. Keep in mind that the resulting solution should be far less concentrated than what you use to clean dishes.
 Make sure to scrub the steam vents as well, as these are a typical spot for buildups. You can also wipe the rest of the iron to deal with any grime.








This kind of gentle cleaning is ideal for Teflon-coated soleplates which, just like Teflon-coated cookware, keep substances from sticking but are very vulnerable to scratches.
 Wipe until all traces of the soap are gone. Place the iron upright on a counter or table and let it dry; you can place a towel under the iron to catch any dripping water.
 Make sure you use white toothpaste rather than gel; the former has a foaming effect that the latter lacks. Use an amount no larger than a quarter.
 Pay particular attention to the steam vents, as various kinds of residue tend to build up there.If your iron’s soleplate is particularly dirty, you can also use a kitchen sponge or scrubber to dislodge the grime. Avoid using a metal scrubber, as this will scratch the soleplate.
 Rub thoroughly to ensure that none of the toothpaste remains. Otherwise you might stain your clothes when trying to use your iron.
 Make sure to use a cloth you’re not too attached to, as some tenacious residues may end up staining it. Turn the iron to its highest setting and iron for a few minutes; the clean water will flush out any toothpaste that might have been rubbed into the steam vents.








Pour out any remaining water over a sink.
Set the iron out to dry.

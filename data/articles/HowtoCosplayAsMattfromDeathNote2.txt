 Matt in the anime has a little bit more color than in the manga.
 In the anime, Matt wears a brown vest with a white fur lining. You can do this vest or a plain white vest. He also wears dark brown or black gloves. He also wears black goggles with orange lenses.
 His boots in the anime go up to his calve. For this look, try snow boots or platform boots. If it's a hot day, then try black sneakers or thin boots.
 In the anime, it seems Matt's hair is a light brown with a choppy, messy cut. If this is natural on, you then you might just have to style it a little bit. If this isn't your current color or cut, then again you can try a wig.

 You can try placing the cages near each other, but if either bird seems stressed, place them at a greater distance.;
, If either bird experiences stress, you should try to minimize it. Signs of stress include picking at feathers or skin, squawking or vocalizing loudly, and pecking or flapping its wings aggressively.If you see any behavioral abnormalities, separate the birds and take them back to their respective rooms.
 Keep these initial introductions down to ten minutes or so. Place the cages in the same room for about ten minutes or so, then remove them to their separate rooms. Ensure the new bird has ended its quarantine period before introducing it to your original bird.
 You could provide a playstand for the birds to hop and fly around on.
 However, to ensure your original bird doesn’t feel that it’s being supplanted, take it out first. If you want to give your birds treats, give one to the original bird first, then give one to the new bird.
 Do not put two new birds together and leave the room, even if they are in separate cages. This could cause undue stress for both birds.
 Biting, screaming, squawking, or other negative behaviors should be dealt with by placing both birds back in their cages for a time-out. If your bird scratches or claws at its own feathers or skin, it might be appropriate to separate it from the other bird.
 All birds have unique personalities and temperaments.Certain actions or sounds might trigger one bird but not the other. For example, one bird might tire quickly of playing with another, and need to be put back in its own cage. Stay conscious of differences in personality between the two different birds when deciding how to treat them.
 Some birds get along great together. Others take time but will eventually warm to one another. Other birds will never get along well together. Recognize when birds do not get along and respect their wishes by not placing them together.

 The browser’s icon is usually located either at the desktop or at the taskbar.


The taskbar is the bar at the bottom of your screen.
 This button is located on the top-right side of the window. It looks like 3 bars. Clicking on the “Menu” button will open a drop box with different options.
 A window will appear with some tabs on top of it.

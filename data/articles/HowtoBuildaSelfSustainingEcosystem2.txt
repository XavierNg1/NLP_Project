 Aquariums take a bit of maintenance to make sure all of your critters stay alive and well. About every 2 weeks, 10-15% of the water in the tank should be replaced with fresh water. If you are using tap water, let the water sit in an aerated bucket for about 24 hours to allow the chlorine to air out.Check your local water source to determine if there are heavy metals in your water.
Use filtered water if you are concerned about the quality of your tap water.
 A gravel vacuum is a handy tool to have to help control the algae in your aquarium. When you change out the water, vacuum the gravel at the same time to remove algae growth and any uneaten food that may have accumulated.Clean the aquarium walls with filter floss or a magnetic tank scrubber to keep algae from accumulating on the glass.
Add plants, snails, or daphnia to help control the growth.
 Count your fish at least once a week to determine if any have died. Smaller fish can decompose quickly and cause spikes in nitrite, ammonia, and nitrate levels. These can be harmful to the other fish in your tank. If you see a dead fish, remove it as soon as possible.Use a test kit to check the levels of ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH. Replace the water if the levels are too high.

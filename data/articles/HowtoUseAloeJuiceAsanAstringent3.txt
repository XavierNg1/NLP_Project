 You can add this boost to your homemade aloe juice, or make store-bought aloe gel or aloe juice astringent enough to work as a facial toner. Lemon juice and aloe juice alone can make an effective astringent, especially if you have fairly normal skin. For extremely oily skin, however, you may want to try something more.


Note that you do not need to add lemon juice to store-bought aloe juice before improving it with the below formula. If using fresh aloe gel directly harvested from an aloe leaf, though, you need to add lemon juice in order to preserve the aloe and prevent it from oxidizing.
 Blend the two together for one to two minutes to get a thoroughly diluted aloe juice.


You can also use aloe gel instead of aloe juice to create a slightly thicker diluted aloe juice.
 Leave enough room at the top of the jar, in case your solution expands when cooled inside the refrigerator.
 Chamomile oil is another astringent. It also has a nice smell and contributes vitamins and antioxidant flavonoids that prevent damage to the skin.
 Shake it vigorously to make sure that the oil spreads throughout the entire solution.
 You may need to shake the jar before each use if you notice the aloe, oil, and water separating.

 Set aside until ready to use.


This is a vegan alternative to Thousand Island dressing, which usually contains standard mayonnaise.
 Place the four ingredients in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture begins to simmer but has not yet come to a full boil.


Heating the ingredients will help the flavors blend more thoroughly.
 Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for about 15 minutes.


Stir the tempeh periodically as it cooks to prevent it from burning or sticking.
By the end of this step, you will have little to no liquid left in the saucepan.
 Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of olive oil to a large skillet and heat over medium for a couple of minutes.


When done, the oil should be glossy enough to look as though it is “shimmering.” Do not allow it to become so hot that it starts to smoke, though.
 Add the tempeh to the hot oil and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes, turning halfway through to cook both sides.


This part of the process makes the tempeh slightly crispy.
 Grease a frying pan or griddle with a light coating of olive oil and heat for a couple of minutes over medium heat.


You could also use cooking spray instead of olive oil, if desired.
 Lay out 4 slices of rye bread. On each slice, place 1/4 of the tempeh, 1 slice of vegan cheese, 1/4 of the sauerkraut, and 1/4 of the vegan Thousand Island dressing. Top each sandwich with another slice of rye bread.
 Place the assembled sandwiches in the oiled frying pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes on each side.


Each side should turn a light golden brown when done.
 Remove the finished sandwiches and place them on a cutting board. Cut in half with a serrated knife and enjoy.

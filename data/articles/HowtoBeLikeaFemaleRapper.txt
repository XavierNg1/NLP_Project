 This is essential. Research on other rap styles and practice to simple beats and then get more complicated. Beatboxing is good. Have your close friends review your flow BEFORE you start showing everyone you have skills;
, Many rappers use these in their raps. EG. the word 'BRAIN' can be associated with smart people and the organ in your head but it is also slang for something x-rated.'

, Female rappers are never scared of anything and can put any rude girl in their place. You must be confident. If your sweet and shy then it's not going to work - grow some lady balls and toughen up.
 This is the creative part. Go to a good hair salon if you are going to try a new look. Many rappers have a very good weave style, braids or multi-coloured wigs in some cases. My cousin is doing the Nicki Minaj Fringe with the top half of the back of her hair in a bun and the bottom half in two corn-rolls ending in twist with some cool accessories and hooped earrings which looks epic and awesome.check what all the other rappers wear and see which is for you.
 Wear items that flatter what you have. For example, I have a big behind and a big chest so I wear what makes my curves look good. Wear a a lot of bling but not too much that it looks like you bought 20 for Â£1 or $1. Or you could go for the sporty look and wear all the latest sports clothes. Look fierce and sexy in your body. Do some research and associate your style to your raps. EG. No pinky, girly, sugar bunny clothes if all your raps have you swearing like a soldier with a rude undertone.
 You can make your eyes a masterpiece but the rest of your face should then be simple and not over done. go for what makes you look hot but not like a hooker.
 Have a hard,firm aura when you walk into a room. have one hand on your hip or both if your bored.
 You should not do this because one day your claims may be put to the test.

 Mix equal parts baking soda and water to form a paste. Apply to any areas blemished by handprints, crayons, or other dirty marks. Use a cloth to softly rub the mixture around the affected surface. Then use a dry cloth or paper towel to wipe away the paste. Reapply as needed., Form a paste that is half baking soda, half water. Apply along the grout in between tiles. Let the paste soak up the dirt for about 10 minutes. Use a toothbrush to scrub the grout once the dirt has loosened.








For tiled floors, you can simply shake some baking soda over the grout and then use a spray bottle to soak it with water instead of forming a paste.
 Fill a mop bucket with warm to hot water. Add at least a ½ cup of baking soda to the water. Stir to mix. Mop your floor with the solution. Rinse the mop and then mop the floor again with clean water to remove any traces of baking soda.
 Soak a hand towel or cleaning cloth with clean water. Dust either the cloth itself or the surface to be cleaned with baking soda.Wipe the surface in a circular motion to remove dirt and stains. Reverse from clockwise to counterclockwise (or vice versa) so that you aren’t merely pushing, say, a stubborn piece of dried, caked tomato sauce down into the countertop again and again.

For tougher stains, create a paste. Mix 3 parts baking soda with 1 part water. Cover the stain and let it soak up the paste for a few minutes before rubbing vigorously with a clean cloth.

 When the letters appear on the tiles, move the tiles around until you have found a word to play. Then place the tiles next to each other in the order that you want them.


The sides of the tiles should be touching.
You may use 3, 4, or 5 letters to make a word.
 Each time you make a legal word, the tiles will beep and highlight the letters in the word. Each word you make scores 1 point. If you make a 5-letter word, then you get an additional 5 seconds of playing time., Each game lasts sixty seconds. You will know when your time is about to expire because the tiles will beep 5 times to count down your last 5 seconds. When your time expires, the tile faces will display a clock to indicate that the game is over., After you have lined up the tiles, wait for your score to appear. The game will display your total score (SCR) and the maximum score (MAX) you could have earned if you had made every word possible with the 5 letters you were given.

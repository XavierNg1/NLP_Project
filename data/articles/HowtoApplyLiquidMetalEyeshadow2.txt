 These kits include a metallic loose powder and a clear, liquid adhesive. Some kits include a waterproof adhesive, which would work well if you need something long-lasting., This will smooth out your eyelid, and make applying the eyeshadow a lot easier.
 Choose a color close to your skin tone (or a shade lighter) and apply it to your brow bone and inner eye corners. Next, choose a matte shade that matches your liquid metal eyeshadow, and apply it to your eyelid. Finish off with a darker shade along the crease and outer corner of your eye. Be sure to blend everything well for a smooth look., You can also pour some of the adhesive into a small dish. You only need a few small drops; a little bit goes a long way.Avoid dipping your brush directly into the adhesive. This way, you won't risk transferring any eyeshadow into it. Most importantly, you will keep the adhesive clean and sanitary.


At the end of the method, clean the adhesive out of the cap before putting it back onto the bottle.
For best results, use a small brush, such as a concealer brush., Most kits' powder jars have a perforated insert. Give the jar a few small shakes to get some powder onto the lid, then dip the brush into that powder. Avoid dipping the brush into the entire jar, if you can.
 Use long, smooth strokes, going from the inner corner of your eye to the outer. If the finish is too sheer for you, apply more powder using a light, tapping motion.
 For a more dramatic look, add some false eyelashes.

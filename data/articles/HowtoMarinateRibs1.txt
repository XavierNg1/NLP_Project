 Place them in the refrigerator two to four days before your plan to cook them. The amount of defrosting time is commensurate with the size of the rack.;
, Slice the thin membrane at the back and pull it off to make it more tender and allow the marinade to penetrate a little further.
 Ideally, with a valuable piece of meat, like ribs, you want to marinate for one day to 12 hours. It takes salt 24 hours to penetrate the meat to one inch (2.5cm) deep.The rest of the ingredients are mainly used as a flavorful surface treatment.
Double your recipe if you have more than five lbs. of ribs.
Reserve leftover marinade to baste with during the cooking process.
 If you don’t have anything that is big enough to fit your rack, pour it into a very large plastic bag or cut the ribs in half and place them in two different containers.
 Turn them over a few times. Stick the container in the fridge.
 Use the liquid at the bottom of the bag or container. Turn the ribs instead, if the ribs aren’t submerged in the liquid.
 Discard the remaining liquid after this point.
 Then continue cooking at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 Celsius) for 45 minutes uncovered.

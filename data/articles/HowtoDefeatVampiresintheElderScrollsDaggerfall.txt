 Only weapons made of silver or of a better material can harm a vampire. Weapons made of iron, leather, or chain won’t deal any damage to vampires. Weapons made from steel, silver, elven, dwarven, mithril, adamantium, ebony, orcish, or daedric deal heavy damage on these monsters. Swords and axes made from silver or better materials can be obtained as random loots from various kinds of monsters. There’s no specific area or monster that you can get these kinds of weapons, but you are sure to get one by opening treasure boxes inside dungeons.;
, Vampires can be found in dark places like caves and dungeons. They can also be found roaming around the outside world during nighttime because these creatures cannot walk in broad daylight during the day.
 Since majority of the weapons that come in silver or better are melee weapons, like swords and axes, you have to battle the monster up close. Spells are useless against vampires. When you see a vampire, ready yourself to attack any time and slowly approach it.
 Vampires attack slowly, so there’s no need to panic when you encounter one. If you have high HP points, you can go ahead and relentlessly attack when you see one. Otherwise, take time to observe the attack pattern of a vampire. They only have close-range attacks, so take a quick back step to avoid damage.


Also, if you do get hit a vampire’s attack, there’s a 2% chance of contracting a disease, and 0.6% chance of your character becoming a vampire, so be very extra careful.
 Once you get the rhythm of the beast’s attacks, time your offense and quickly slash it with your sword or axe made out of silver or better material. You’ll notice that the vampire will take severe damage from your weapon, and if you’re weapon is made of a higher material, like orcish or daedric, there’s a 100% chance of taking the monster out with a single blow.

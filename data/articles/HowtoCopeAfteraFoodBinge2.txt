 The National Institutes of Health defines binge eating as: “an eating disorder in which a person regularly eats unusually large amounts of food. During binge eating, the person also feels a loss of control and is not able to stop eating.”The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual V (DSM-5) says that this behavior must occur at least once per week for three months to be classified as an eating disorder.Check if one or more of the following symptoms is present:


Eating large amounts of food frequently throughout the day.
Eating when not physically hungry.
Unable to stop eating even after the person is no longer hungry.
Eating alone or hiding the food and the amounts eaten from others.
Feelings of shame, disgust, depression and guilt after eating.
Binge eating does not necessarily include purging behavior (forcing yourself to vomit).
 Clinical depression is linked to binge eating. In fact, a person who has symptoms of binge eating could benefit from being evaluated for depression since the two are so closely related.Although binge eating is more common in females than in males, both genders can develop binge eating patterns as a response to depression and stress. Females typically develop eating disorders in adolescence while males may not see symptoms until adulthood.
 Body image is how you see yourself when you look in the mirror and how you feel about your body’s height, shape and size. Body image includes the way you feel about your appearance and how comfortable or uncomfortable you feel in your body. According to the National Eating Disorders Association, “people with negative body image have a greater likelihood of developing an eating disorder and are more likely to suffer from feelings of depression, isolation, low self-esteem, and obsessions with weight loss.”

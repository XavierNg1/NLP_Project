 Lemon juice is a natural bleaching agent that can be used to make freckles look lighter and disappear. It works best on natural freckles, rather than freckles caused by sun exposure, since those tend to be darker and less uniform in appearance.


Buy a few fresh lemons and squeeze the juice into a bowl. You can also use pre-squeezed lemon juice.
Dip a cotton ball in the lemon juice and apply it to your face in the freckled area. Let the lemon juice soak into your skin for 10 minutes, then rinse it off with cool water.
Apply lemon juice every day to lighten your freckles over time.;
, Another natural method for lightening freckles is to apply a milk-based mask to your face and let it soak into your skin. The lactic acid in milk peels away the top layer of skin, making freckles lighter in appearance. This method is better for natural freckles than sun-induced freckles.


Spread 1/4 cup of sour cream over the areas most affected by freckles. Let the sour cream soak into your skin for 10 minutes, then rinse it away with cool water and pat dry.
Use a whole milk wash. Simply pour some whole milk into a bowl and rub it over your face. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then rinse your face with cool water and pat dry.
 Mixing fruits together and letting them dry on your skin is a natural way to peel away the top layer of skin to lighten the appearance of your freckles. The sticky fruit bonds with the skin and helps it gently peel away.


Mash up strawberries and a kiwi in a bowl. Rub the mixture over your face, concentrating in the areas where you have the most freckles. Let the mixture dry completely, which should take about 20 minutes. Peel the fruit away and rinse your skin with cool water.
Try cucumbers or apricots as a substitute for strawberries or kiwis.

 These lines are what will give you a basic idea of what the shape of the face is. The color should either be in red or blue, or whatever color you won't be using as your lineart (which is usually black.);
, This is a basic black/dark color outline of your drawings face.
 To erase the base lines, take the color you made them with, (in this case, red) click on the eraser tool, then right click and hold and drag over the red lines to erase. This will not erase the lineart. Your image will then look like this.
 Use the zoom tool and zoom in on the eye (or eyes.) Use the pencil tool to create the kind of eye you want, then use the fill icon to fill in the blank space. Then make a highlight in the eye.
 Go to the right hand corner of the screen and click edit colors if you don't want to use the colors already available.
 Once you get the colors you want (skin tone, hair color, eye color, etc.), click the fill icon and fill in the image.
, To do this, click your skin tone, go to edit colors, and make a color that is slightly darker than your original skin tone. Pencil the outline of the shadows, then fill them in using the same color.
, Click your skin tone again, go to edit colors, and make a much lighter version of your skin tone, almost white. Pencil the outline of the highlights, on hair and skin, and fill them in.
 You can either fill in the background with a solid color, or you can make a scene behind your character. You can also put some clothes on her/him/it as well, if inspiration strikes!


You can even further manipulate the image for different looks and effects. Have a little fun with it!

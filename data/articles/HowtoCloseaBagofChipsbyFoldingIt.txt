, Use both hands and fold the open end down about an inch (2.5 cm). Do not roll.
 Tuck each folded end under as you keep flattening and folding once again. Continue in this manner until you reach just above the area of the chips.
 Flatten the fold with your hands and fold the corners towards the middle. It doesn't matter which way you fold them; here they are shown folded towards the rolled side, but you can also fold away from the roll.
 While keeping the corners folded, unroll the end and fold it over the corners so that it makes a tight pocket or hood holding the ends in.
 Check by turning the bag upside down. It is sealed and easy to open the next time you need to use it.

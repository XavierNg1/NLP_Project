 You never know, something really cool might end up there at 60% off!

, When you're going to buy something in the Curio Shop, always compare prices with the W-Shop. Sometimes Arte has things on sale, but usually they're just more expensive. If you can't find it at the W-Shop, it's a rare item. Rare items cost a lot.
 For instance, instead of making a cowboy movie in the Wild West play-set, try making a cowboy and the dog in the default character set be cowboys in the park or whatever that is! Then you would only have to buy the cowboy and that's it.
, You will only get back half of what you spent, but it is better than nothing...

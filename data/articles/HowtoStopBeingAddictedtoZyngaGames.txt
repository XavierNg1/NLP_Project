 Make sure you have done all your chores and work before you log on.;
,, Also, try to log into Facebook only once every couple of days to avoid seeing the reminders there to play.
 Or, play a proper computer game with good content and graphics, such as a flight simulator or, if you like violence, a first-person shooter to get your fill of gaming. Even one a few years old will be far ahead of a console game, which are themselves pretty amazing, and the older ones will run on almost any computer. (These can be somewhat addicting too, but are very fun rather than just fun enough to keep you clicking.)

 You want to be sure that you are starting with no sound distortions.;
, The amplifier is usually an aftermarket part that is installed trunk of a car or the rear of a truck. There will be a knob that labeled "gain." Turning down the gain means that the amplifier is not amplifying the signal coming in from the stereo head (the part mounted to your dash).
 You will not be able to hear anything yet, since your volume is set to zero.
 This is the best range to use when setting gain because you avoid overworking the stereo head. If you overwork the stereo head you could end up sending distorted sounds to your amplifier. Digital displays make it easy to tell when you are at 2/3 volume, but if you do not have one you can turn the volume all the way up (counting the number of turns) and then turn it back 1/3 of the way. For example, if you turn the volume knob 3 times to get to max volume, you would turn it back down 1 full turn to get to 2/3 volume.
 Turn it up (clockwise) until the sound (music, talking, test tone, etc.) is as loud as you might ever want to listen to it, so long as you do not hear any sound distortion or overload your speakers. If you do hear a distortion, turn the gain back down until the distortion is gone. Some amplifiers will have a knob that can be turned by hand, but others may require the use of a screwdriver to adjust the gain.
 Now that your gain is set, you can go back to the driverâ€™s seat and enjoy the music.

 The first date is the one he/she is going to remember, so picking a place he/she wouldn't expect can make a great first impression. Keep in mind that your date has to be on board with this, as he/she may have been expecting a planned date.


This kind of date isn't for everyone. You'll need to know if your date genuinely likes the surprise element of not knowing what's next. If you don't know your date well, you may ask if he/she wants to be spontaneous. If not, have a backup date already planned.
If it looks like your date isn't enjoying something you've decided to do or somewhere you've gone, ask where he/she would like to go or what he/she would rather do.
 First dates can be stressful; you're getting to know a new person or a person in a new way and vice versa. You can relieve some of this pressure by experiencing something new together. Trying a new cuisine can be a fun and easy new experience.Make sure you and your date are not allergic or opposed to the cuisine you want to try.
 Go to a tourist attraction that your date has never been to (or hasn't been to in a while). While you can casually explore the landmark, museum, park, etc., you could also play up the tourist aspect. Take cheesy photos, consult the map, and stop by the gift shop on your way out.Make sure you consider the location and time of your date. It may be hard to talk and enjoy yourself if you choose the attraction's busiest day and time of the week.

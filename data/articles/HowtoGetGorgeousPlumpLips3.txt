 Mix a small of amount of honey and a small amount of brown sugar in a bowl then rub in on your lips for 3 minutes wipe it off and clean your lips off with a wet paper towel. Top it off with a layer of Aquaphor once they are dry.
 This will also temporarily swell them. If your lips are really dry and flaking, then try a layer of Carmex, topped with a layer of petroleum jelly or Aquaphor when you go to sleep at night. You should wake up with soft, flake-free lips.
 Make sure not to remove it. After repeating the first step for one week, apply any face cream on your lips for 10 seconds, then wash it off and apply coconut oil again. This will add plenty of moisture to your lips and naturally give it a pinkish color, along with plump lips. Do this for at least two weeks. Then just for 3 days, keep applying water on your lips with a brush or with your finger. By doing so, you will be taking off the dry skin and giving a new layer to your gorgeous lips.

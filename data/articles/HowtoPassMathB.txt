 The first time your teacher explains something will probably be one of the only times, so you will want to be part of it.;
, Instead of rushing through your homework, take the time to actually think everything through. Don't lose unnecessary points just because you made some stupid mistake that you would not have made if you had not rushed.
 If you're allowed to use it, that means that you will probably have to, or you wouldn't be allowed to use it.
 Even if it will solve anything you'll encounter, not knowing how to get it to solve anything will be a definite setback.
 You can help each other through things you don't understand.
 As long as you're not ignoring them, most teachers would be happy to re-explain something if you don't get it; it shows you actually care.
 If some of the concepts just don't make sense, you might need one-on-one help from someone.
 You'll probably remember something like SOH CAH TOA better than "Sine equals opposite over hypotenuse, etc." Here are a few to get you started:


SOH CAH TOA: Sine equals Opposite over Hypotenuse, Cosine equals Adjacent over Hypotenuse, Tangent equals Opposite over Adjacent.
Si si co co si(si is pronounced like "sine" without the n): Sin(x+y) = sin(x)cos(y) + cos(x)sine(y). Remember that the operation in the parentheses of the initial sine will be the same as the operation on the other side.
Co co co si si: Cos(x+y) = cos(x)cos(y) - sin(x)sin(y). Remember that the operation in the argument of the initial cosine will be different than the operation on the other side.
 Sometimes, if something is explained in a different way, understand it better.

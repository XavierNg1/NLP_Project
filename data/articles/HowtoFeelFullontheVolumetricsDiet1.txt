 Build a healthful salad instead of a restaurant-style salad drenched in extra dressing.


Fill the plate with leafy greens, including lettuce, baby greens, arugula and shredded cabbage.
Add other vegetables based on color and flavor. For example, consider grilled vegetables that you may not ordinarily put in your salad.
Create a layer of flavor to contrast the vegetables. Fruit often provides an injection of sweetness that counteracts the bitterness of the vegetables.
Dress the salad just before you serve it to keep it crisp. Make a dressing combining 3 parts vinegar or fruit juice with one part high-quality oil and seasonings.
Add a protein to salad to make it a meal. Try grilled chicken, chickpeas or low-fat cottage cheese.;

Start with a whole grain pita or tortilla and spread it with hummus or flavored mustard. Add a layer of low CD vegetables and top the salad with lean protein or reduced fat cheese. Sprinkle the sandwich with fresh herbs or hot sauce.
Utilize hidden vegetables. Chop or puree vegetables and serve them in a variety of dishes. For instance, try Pumpkin Cranberry Bread, Squash Risotto or Cauliflower Rice.
 Include vegetables with a variety of colors, and use both fresh and frozen varieties. Try a new fruit or vegetable every week or start your own vegetable garden.



Roast vegetables to bring out their natural sweetness.
Add a pinch of sugar to a vegetable dish to counteract the bitter taste.
Make sure that you donâ€™t overcook your vegetables.
Add butter, flavorful oil, grated cheese or salad dressing to enhance the flavor.



Purchase peeled and precut vegetables or vegetables from a salad bar. While these may be more expensive, they can help you get a meal on the table quickly.
Eat frozen vegetables or high-quality canned vegetables. If you use canned vegetables, then rinse them to cut the sodium content before you add them to a dish.

 This is best done with a drill, but can also be accomplished with a screwdriver if necessary.
 Place objects such as screwdrivers or shallow wedges at the bottom of the doorway. Have somebody hold the door in the frame in exactly the position that you want it to hang. The hinge knuckles should be parallel with the frame. Draw around the hinges with a pencil.
 After carefully putting the door aside, cut mortises in the door frame in the same way that you did on the door itself. Hold the door against the frame again to test the placement and make sure the hinges are flush.
 Mark pilot holes on the frame with a pencil and then drill through these marks in the same way you did for the door. Put the screws through the pilot holes to affix the hinges on the frame.

 Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with a layer of aluminum foil.;
, Use a sharp serrated knife to pierce the spaghetti squash a dozen times or so.


The skin of a spaghetti squash is very thick, so you will need a heavy, sharp serrated knife to break through it in the squash's uncooked state.
Piercing the skin allows the squash to vent as it cooks. You could try baking it without piercing the skin, first, but the risk involved is that pressure could build up inside the squash and cause it to burst.
 Place the squash on your prepared baking sheet and bake in your preheated oven until done.


The squash is done once you can pierce through the skin easily with a small paring knife. You should also be able to pierce the skin with a fork, but there may still be a little resistance when using a fork.
 Hold the spaghetti squash down with one hand, using a towel or oven mitt to protect your hand from getting burned. With your dominant hand, cut the squash through from one end to the other, using a serrated knife.


You may want to wait 10 to 15 minutes before cutting the squash open so that the skin becomes cool enough to touch without getting burned.
 Open the squash up and dig out the seeds and pulp using two forks.


Do not scrape the sides of the squash. The seeds and pulp in the center of the squash are not edible, but the strands of squash you can scrape from the sides are.
 Scrape around the entire perimeter of the squash, separating the "spaghetti" strands from the inside of the skin.


Continue scraping until all of the flesh has formed "spaghetti."
Lift the scraped flesh out into a mixing bowl or serving platter using your two forks.
 Add olive oil, salt, and pepper to the cooked "spaghetti." Toss with your forks to coat thoroughly and serve warm.

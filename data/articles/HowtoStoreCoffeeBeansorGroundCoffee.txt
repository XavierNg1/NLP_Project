 As soon as coffee is ground, its surface area is vastly increased and it begins deteriorating very quickly. Pre-ground coffee therefore tastes and smells much staler and less vibrant than coffee ground freshly before brewing. If you are interested in storing your coffee to achieve optimal flavor, the most important step you can take is to invest in a coffee grinder so that you can grind coffee beans just before brewing.;
, Light is perhaps the primarily culprit for causing coffee beans or grounds to go stale quickly. This problem is easily remedied by storing coffee in an opaque container rather than a clear glass or plastic vessel. If you insist on storing your coffee in a transparent container, it is best to store the container away from light, for example in a pantry or cabinet.
 A second enemy of fresh-tasting coffee is oxygen. Exposure to the air causes coffee beans, or especially ground coffee, to go stale very quickly. Invest in a hermetically sealed container for storing coffee, or at least use a container with a very heavy lid. Airtight containers are also ideal for preventing coffee from absorbing neighboring odors and discouraging insect and mold growth.
 You may not have a great degree of control over the moisture level in your kitchen pantry or cabinets, but note that coffee will keep best in a dry environment. For example, avoid storing coffee beans in a damp basement.
 Like many bulk food items, coffee does not keep well in extremely cold or hot temperatures. Avoid storing coffee in rooms that are not heated in winter or that are not cooled during summer.

 Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees F (176.6 degrees C). Fill a baking pan about halfway with warm water. Add 1 cup (240 ml) of white vinegar to the baking dish., Place the dish (filled with water and vinegar) on the middle oven rack in your pre-heated oven. Leave this to bake for 1 hour. You may want to set a timer for yourself., After the vinegar and water has finished baking, turn off your oven. Leave the door closed, and leave the baking dish inside. Wait 45-60 minutes, until your oven feels cool to the touch. Remove the baking dish and your oven racks., Place some white vinegar in a spray bottle and spray down the inside of your oven. Then, sprinkle baking soda on the sides and bottom of your oven. Wait five minutes while the mixture foams., Use a damp sponge to scrub the inside of your oven. The grime and food residue should come off easily. If you encounter any chunks, use a plastic spatula to pry these off., Rinse off your sponge with clean water, and fill a dish with clean water. Use the water and your sponge to remove the vinegar and baking soda from the inside of your oven. When you are finished, return the oven racks.

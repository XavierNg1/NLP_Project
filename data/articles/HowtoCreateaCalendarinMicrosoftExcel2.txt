 You can import data from Excel into your Outlook calendar. This can make importing things like work schedules much easier.
 It will be a lot easier to import your list into Outlook if your spreadsheet is formatted with the proper headers. Enter the following headers into the first row:


Subject
Start Date
Start Time
End Date
End Time
Description
Location

, The "Subject" field is the name of the event as it appears on your calendar. You don't need to enter something for every field, but you will need at least a "Start Date" as well as the "Subject."


Make sure to enter the date into the standard MM/DD/YY or DD/MM/YY format so that it can be read properly by Outlook.
You can make an event that spans multiple days by using the "Start Date" and "End Date" fields.
 Once you're finished adding events to your list, you can save a copy of it in a format that can be read by Outlook.
 This is a common format that can be imported into a variety of different programs, including Outlook.
 Give the list a name and save it in CSV format. Click "Yes" when asked by Excel if you want to continue.

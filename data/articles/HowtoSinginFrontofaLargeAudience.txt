 It could be one you already know, or you could try something different and sing something you aren't used to.;
, Nothing is more embarrassing than forgetting lyrics to the song when you're in front of, let's say, one hundred people. The more you practice, the better you'll memorize the words and tune. Hint: think about what the song means. Try saying the lyrics as if you were talking to a friend. This will help you connect the ideas.
 It could be a parent, a friend, or your grandparents.


If you're singing a cappella, try to sing loud and proud. If you're singing with music, try to sing when you're supposed to sing. Don't wait for the accompanist -- they are supposed to be following you! If you're singing on a CD where the artist is also singing, sing with her/him. If there's no microphone, "aim" your voice at the folks in the back of the audience.
 Look at your friend in the audience, but you need to look at all the other crowd members as well. Don't stare at one person in particular, like the lady with a funny hat. Instead, look randomly at people. Remember, you want to help everyone enjoy the song!

, Practice as much as you need until you feel that you're ready and that you have the song down pat.
 It's showtime! Get up onto the stage, and sing! Show them what you can do! If it's a competition and there's a trophy involved, keep a clear head. I hope you win!

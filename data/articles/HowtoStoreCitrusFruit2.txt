 Oranges tend to preserve best at cooler temperatures and deteriorate quickly at warmer temperatures. Keeping them refrigerated will slow down the deterioration process and will help to maintain freshness for an extended period of time.Using a mesh or otherwise well-ventilated bag will keep the air circulating around the fruit. This will help to prolong the occurrence of mold, lesions or softened produce.
Store them in your refrigeratorâ€™s vegetable bin and be sure to rotate the fruit regularly to maintain airflow.
Oranges stored in a refrigerator should keep for approximately one month.
 Oranges kept on a kitchen counter or a table will remain fresh for up to one week at room temperature, depending on how fresh they were to begin with.If your room temperature tends to be on the warmer side, try keeping the home cooler, or placing the fruit bowl into the fridge at night.


Do not cover the bowl with plastic wrap or foil. Airflow is important to keeping oranges fresh.
 Damp oranges that have been stored may quickly become moldy. Ensure that there is no moistness or water droplets on the skin of the fruit.


If they arrive damp, so be sure to towel dry and air them out before storing.

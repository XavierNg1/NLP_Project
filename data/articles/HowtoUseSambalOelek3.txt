 Assemble your ingredients and grab a mortar and pestle. If you don’t have a mortar and pestle, you can use a food processor large enough to accommodate a pound (454 grams) of chilies.Using a mortar and pestle is the traditional method. Oelek, or ulek, refers to the pestle that’s used to grind the chilies., Place the chilies and salt in your mortar or in the work bowl of your food processor. Use your pestle to grind the chilies until they form a paste, working in batches as large as your mortar can handle. If you’re using a processor, pulse the chilies and pause to scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary., While authentic sambal oelek is a simple celebration of raw chili flavor, you can customize your condiment to your own tastes. Experiment with varying levels of sweetness and acidity to find your favorite flavors.Try adding a couple tablespoons of vinegar and lime juice for more acidity. These will also help you sambal stay fresh longer.
Add sweetness with one or two tablespoons of brown or palm sugar.
You can also mince a few cloves of garlic and add it to your sambal (just keep in mind authentic sambal oelek does not contain garlic).

 If your child is growing quickly, he or she may quickly return to a healthy weight-for-height ratio.


Once your child is back within healthy parameters, your pediatrician or dietitian may recommend slight alterations to diet or exercise routines to maintain a healthy weight.
 If your child is not losing weight after following a healthy diet and exercise routine, your childâ€™s weight may be an indication of a more serious medical condition, such as a thyroid imbalance.


Have your toddler evaluated by a health professional on a regular basis during the weight loss endeavor.
 Pediatricians and dietitians often have tons of tips for parents trying to incorporate healthy foods into the diet of a picky eater, or for making physical activity appealing to otherwise sedentary children. Follow their advice if you hit a roadblock with your child.

 If you find an empty wallet, the owner can always claim there was money inside it. Although you can’t completely protect yourself from that accusation, you’ll help yourself if you write down everything that is in the wallet. Type up a list in your smart phone. This will show you were careful about what you found.


Write down the amount of cash in the card and the denomination of the bills. For example, “$46. Two twenties, one five, one one.”
Write down the credit cards.
Note other contents such as the driver’s license, insurance card, etc.
 All you’re doing is turning the wallet over to a different stranger. There’s no reason to think that a store employee won’t steal from someone, so hold onto the wallet yourself.It’s perfectly understandable that you don’t want the wallet in your possession for too long. In that situation, you can ask a store manager if you can use the phone to call the police.
 If you see a wallet drop out of someone’s jacket or pocket, you can pick it up and give it to them. However, if you don’t know who dropped it, you shouldn’t spend time searching for the owner, even if the wallet has a driver’s license in it.


You also shouldn’t mail the wallet back to them. You have no idea if the wallet will even reach the true owner.
Trying to find the owner yourself could also get you in legal trouble. A woman in Wyoming was arrested for not turning the wallet over to the police but instead searching for the owner herself., Your best bet is to hand over the wallet to the police, where it will be kept safely.Also, if there’s no identifying information in the wallet, the police are better equipped to find the owner. Drive to the police station and report that you found a missing wallet.


You might have to fill out some paperwork. At a minimum, you’ll have to give the police your name and address.

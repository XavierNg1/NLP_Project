 Set a timer for the amount of time you are going to sit and meditate. This can be however long or short you have. If you only have one minute to meditate, then set your timer for one minute.Try using a soothing alarm to bring you gently back into your day. There are many meditation timers that can be downloaded on mobile devices, like Insight Timer., Relax and get comfortable. Find your seat, adjust your posture, and set your gaze. There is no reason to rush your initial preparation for meditation. Take your time and find points where your body and mind can relax.Consider your initial seating with how long you will be sitting. If you haven’t sat in full lotus before, then you might not want to try it for 20 minutes your first time.
 Focusing on your breath will help you ease into meditation and loosen your attention. The more fixed on your breath you are, the easier it will be to clear your mind and let go of any thoughts.It might help to count your breaths when you first begin meditating.
 Softening your attention is another way of saying that you need to clear your mind and let go of your daily thoughts. Instead of focusing on what you need to do after you finish meditating, or what just happened right before you sat down, clear your head and be present in the space you are currently in. Let your attention drift from everything but the present moment!However, keep in mind that “ordinary” thoughts are part of the meditative experience. You will come back to schedules, chores, lists, and stories. Don’t get frustrated or hung up on them. Instead, focus on your breath when your mind inevitably wanders. Return to your breath each time this happens and begin to let these thoughts go.

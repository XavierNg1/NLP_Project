 Usually, this will be the height of the interior floor and just below the threshold of any planned or current door that will open onto the deck. Use a level to draw a line on the siding the whole length of the deck.
 From the line you just marked, measure down the thickness of the deck boards (usually 1 to 1 1/2 inches, or 2.5 to 3.75 centimeters), plus the height of the ledger board. (If the ledger board is a 2 x 10, this will be 9.5 inches, or 23.75 centimeters.) Mark this line across the entire length of where the ledger board will go.
 If the siding is solid siding, you can cut it away with a circular saw and jigsaw, provided you don't cut into the sheathing beneath the siding. If the siding is vinyl siding, you'll need a special tool to pry up the siding; after removing it, you'll need to re-mark the lines for top of the deck and the bottom of the ledger board on the sheathing.









Ignore the steps in this section if you're planning to make a free-standing deck.

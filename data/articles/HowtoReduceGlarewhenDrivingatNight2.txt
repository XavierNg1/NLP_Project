 Before driving, always make sure your eyeglasses are clean. Use soap and water to remove dirt, grime and debris from the lenses. Finish cleaning your lenses by drying them with a soft microfiber cloth., If you wear glasses, ask your optometrist about anti-reflective (AR) coating. AR coating is an ultra-thin film made from silicon and zircon. By reducing internal reflection and transmitting more light, the film will improve your vision while driving during the night., Instead, avert your eyes when oncoming traffic approaches. Do this by looking down and to the right. Focus on the white line on the side of the road, or the pavement until the car passes.As you do this, you will still be able to see other cars around you with your peripheral vision.
 Having difficulty seeing and other medical problems associated with the eyes can exacerbate glare while driving at night. Make sure to visit your eye doctor regularly. This way you can catch and correct any eye problems to avoid vision problems while driving at night.The American Optometric Association recommends that you get an eye check-up every two years if you are under 60, and once a year if you are 60 or older.

 Before you kill anything, you need to make sure you’re dealing with a fly. Just because you hear a buzzing sound doesn’t mean that it’s a fly roaming around you. Beware of bees and wasps.


You shouldn’t kill bees because they are important to the environment and can potentially sting you.
 Take an inventory of the supplies around you. Sometimes a fly will start to annoy you away from anything useful like a wall or fly swatter. These can be difficult scenarios for successful fly-catching.
 Using two hands is a difficult way to catch a fly, but it is also the most intuitive method. To catch the fly you will use your hands in a clapping motion. The idea is to catch the fly by trapping it between your two hands., Before clapping like a madman, you need to briefly study the fly’s patterns and habits. You won’t be able to fully map out its behavior, but a basic idea might help.


Also, training your eyes to follow its movements will help your coordination in catching the fly.
The fly also might leave your personal space while watching it. This will save its life and prevent you from cleaning up a mess., After you feel confident enough in tracking the fly you can strike it down. Wait for the fly to come close enough to you or your food. Once it is within arm's reach, make a quick move to clap the fly out of its existence.


Holding your hands in an extended position close to the fly will help you move quicker.
 Dispose of the fly and wash your hands thoroughly. Flies can hold harmful bacteria that you don’t want to mess with.

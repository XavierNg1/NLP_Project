 Their ultra-simple mechanics make them very easy to manufacture, and their basic design has been around for centuries.
 Ammunition is stored in a round piece of metal called a "cylinder", which rotates when the hammer is cocked or the trigger is pulled (depending on the "action" of the revolver). If a round fails to fire, simply cocking the hammer or pulling the trigger again (depending on the capabilities of the revolver) will rotate the cylinder for a new cartridge.
 A standard shooter would have a hard time making a spurless (hammerless), double-action revolver not shoot when the trigger is pulled. The design is simple, and the use is even simpler: pick up a loaded gun, disengage the safety (if applicable), and pull the trigger, and it will fire.






Simpler operation means that a new shooter is more easily able to unload a revolver. Removing all of the ammunition from the cylinder quickly unloads the gun.






Revolvers also generally are chambered in more powerful calibers than their semi-automatic counterparts. .357 Magnum and .44 Magnum revolvers are extremely popular and pack a great deal of energy when fired.
 Even speed loaders require practice and still are not as fast as changing out a preloaded magazine as you can do with a pistol.






Cylinders often can not hold nearly as many cartridges as pistol magazines, meaning one must reload more often in the rare event of a prolonged firefight. One should note, however, that most self-defense encounters require less than four or five shots.






Although they may be more "reliable" they are by no means more rugged. The mechanism for DA revolvers require clockwork precision. As pointed out by renowned firearms trainer Massad Ayoob, auto-pistols are superior in dealing with grit and grime (such as chunks of gore etc.)

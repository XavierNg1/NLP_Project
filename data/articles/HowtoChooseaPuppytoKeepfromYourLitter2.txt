 Puppies are all inquisitive and like to chew or crawl on you. But each puppy has a different personality, which can be easily figured out by watching the puppies interact with each other.You can tell by watching the interaction which puppies are strong, bossy, or noisy, which are quiet or gentle, and which seem like they get picked on.
 After watching the puppies with their littermates, separate them. The puppy may change their behavior when not around others. You can get a better sense of what they will be like as your pet if you separate them.Play with the puppy, call it to you, hold it, and interact in ways you believe you would interact with it at your home. This can give you a sense of what the puppy will be like when you get it home.
For example, quiet, gentle dogs may be more energetic when not around others, and energetic puppies may calm down when not influenced by the other puppies.
 Since you are choosing a puppy from your own litter, you can take the time to really watch the puppies and interact with them. Play with them. Study how they react to you and your family. Watching the puppies for a few days to a few weeks can help you determine which dog is right for you.Get down on the floor and call the puppies to you. Do this multiple days to see how they react each time you interact with them.
Encourage your family to interact with the puppies to get a sense of how they will fit into your home.
You should spend at least 30 minutes a day with each puppy once they are three weeks old. This can be broken up into short handling sessions throughout the day. This will help you get to know each puppy.

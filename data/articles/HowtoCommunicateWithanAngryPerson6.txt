 Your personal physical safety should be your number one concern when you are with someone who is angry most or all the time.If you have children in the house and they experience harm to their physical, emotional, and mental safety, or they witness violence in the household, you need to ensure your own safety and the safety of your children.


Have a plan so you know what to do if your safety is at risk.
If it’s possible, obtain an alternate place to stay or stay in a safehouse to ensure your safety.
Use a code word with your children that can be used if anyone is in danger. Teach them what to do in case you use the code word (for example, they should leave the house and run to a specific friend’s house).
 If you are able, talk with your friend, neighbor or family member about your safety plan. Talk over visual cues that you might use if you are in danger., Identify the nearest exits. If you can’t get out of your house, identify safe areas of the house where there are no weapons or other instruments that can be used to hurt you.Always park your car face out in your driveway and keep the gas tank full.
 Carry your phone with you and program in important phone numbers.
 If you are having trouble getting away from your situation, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline. This hotline is staffed with people who can help you come up with a plan. They can also provide you with a shelter to go to.


The National Domestic Violence Hotline’s number is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). The website is http://www.thehotline.org.

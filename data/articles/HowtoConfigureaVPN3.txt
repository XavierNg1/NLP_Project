 There are a variety of programs available for setting up a personal VPN. Many are paid products, but some offer free versions for basic users. LogMeIn Hamachi and OpenVPN are two such programs. If you use the free version of Hamachi, you are limited to 5 connections to your VPN, which is usually enough for most personal users.


For Mac OS X, check out iVPN as well. Hamachi works on Mac OS X too.
This section will be based on LogMeIN Hamachi.
 In order for Hamachi to be effective at creating a private network, the server should be configured on a computer that is generally always connected.


When you run Hamachi for the first time, click the blue Power button to start the server program.
Select the Network menu, and then choose “Create a new network”.
Enter a network name of your choice and create a strong password.
 Each client that you want to connect will need to have the VPN program installed.


On the connecting computer, open the VPN program. Open the Network menu and select “Join an existing network”.
Enter the network information, including the network name and password. Press connect and you will be connected to the Hamachi VPN.

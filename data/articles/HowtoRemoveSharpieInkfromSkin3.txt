 As your skin cells die (a very normal, fairly fast process) you should be able to easily scrub and wash off any remaining ink. This should not take more than a few days. In other words, the ink should come off more or less on its own.
 If any remaining ink needs to be covered up (for example, your frat buddies wrote racist slurs all over your face and you have an internship interview the next day), try makeup. You’ll need foundation and powder in your skin tone. You can also use Dermablend Cover Crème, which is well known for being able to cover just about anything and is frequently used to cover tattoos.









You may need someone a little more experienced to help you apply it if you don’t know how because it is harder than it sounds, but you should be able to cover up any remaining ink with makeup.
 The idea that you can get ink poisoning from getting ink on your skin is false.Ink poisoning can only result from orally ingesting ink, and then only a great deal of it. Again, don’t panic. If you are very concerned, you can call your local poison hotline.

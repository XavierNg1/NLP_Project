 Look for strawberries that are very pointy or triangular in shape with a decent crop of green leaves on the top. The more the strawberry looks like a very fat, well endowed carrot, the better! But don't worry too much, the coating will create a lot of the visual effect.


Larger strawberries provide the best effect because there is more room to imprint the carrot lines and to establish the carrot visual effect.;
, The instructions for coloring white chocolate can be found here.


To get orange, mix a few drops of red and yellow colorant together in a separate bowl, until you're happy with its "carroty" color.
, Be careful not to get the color on the leaves––these must stay green. It is better to err on the side of caution and use a spatula knife or skewer to bring up the last bits of orange chocolate over the red strawberry flesh than to mark the leaves through too much dipping.
, Usually about three evenly spaced lines will suffice to create the visual effect. Do this as follows:

Dip a wooden skewer or chopstick into the melted orange chocolate.

Carefully draw a line around the strawberry in three evenly spaced places. To do this, lay the strawberry on parchment paper and do one side, then allow to set. Once set, turn over the strawberry and do the other side, meeting at the same line ends.
 They look best laid out around or next to a bunny figurine (chocolate, ceramic, whatever) so that it's obvious that they're the bunny's carrots. If giving as a gift, add a chocolate bunny to the box.

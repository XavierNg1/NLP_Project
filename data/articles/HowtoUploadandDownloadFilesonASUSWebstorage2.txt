 Open any web browser on your computer, and go to ASUS WebStorage’s website.


Click on the “Sign in” button found at the upper right side of the page, and you will be brought to the login page.
Enter your ID and password in their respective fields then click on the “Sign in” button to continue.
 Navigate through your main folders or directories by clicking on the folders on the left panel. You can also navigate through your files and folders by clicking on the individual folders.
 To select files, tick on the checkboxes in front of the files you want to download.
 You can download all the selected files at once through a zip file. ASUS WebStorage will compress and combine your files for easy downloading. To do this, click on the “Packing download” button from the header toolbar. Enter the name of the zip file then click on the “OK” button. Your zip file will start downloading to your computer.


If you want to download just a single file, you don’t need to compress it in a zip file. You can just download it directly by hovering over the file and clicking on the downward arrow icon from the taskbar that will appear. Your file will be downloaded as it is.

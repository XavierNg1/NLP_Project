 It's best if you have been riding a few years and have other easier tricks like 360s down first, so you know how your bike likes to move.;
, It's easiest to learn on a 5 foot (1.5 m) ramp, not too steep, and not too mellow.
 You know how you're looking ahead with your head back too see where you're going? That's exactly how you flip.
 Then get a feel for the transition of the ramp pumping into it, and starting your rotation then taking your feet off and landing holding your handlebars.
 This gets your rotation started and really is the key to flipping. Pump hard into the ramp, and picture like you're going through a loop on a roller coaster.
 No matter what happens, don't let go until you can see the landing! If you go off the lip starting a flip and let go right away, your body will keep rotating and your head and back are going to hit the ground harder than you have ever hit it before, and to top it off the bike could land back on top of you. If you hold on, even if you don't make the full rotation, you're only falling from 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) up, you might get banged up but you're much better off.
 It's that simple. Your body will usually correct small imperfections in your rotation automatically and as long as you judged your speed right, you're about to roll away from your first flip! Now if you went too fast, or rotated too quickly (which is pretty easy to do on a new ramp), you may over rotate. This may sound scary, but it's usually no big deal. If you feel you're over rotating, once you see the ground, take your feet off and ditch the bike. 9 times out of 10, you are going to land on your feet...just go a little slower or pump into the ramp a little less next time.

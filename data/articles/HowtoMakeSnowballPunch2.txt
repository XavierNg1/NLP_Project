 Pour 1 gallon bottle (3.78 liters) of chilled blue fruit punch, 1 (2 liter) bottle of chilled lemon-lime soda, and 12 ounces (350 ml) of chilled pineapple juice into a large punch bowl. Slowly stir the punch to combine the ingredients.For a brighter blue punch, use less pineapple juice. For a greener, or teal, color, use more pineapple juice.
 Get out one container of vanilla ice cream and scoop 10 large scoops of ice cream. Try to make them as round as you can so they look like snowballs. Set the snowballs into the punch.If you'd like the snowballs to keep they're round shape, you can place the scoops of ice cream on a baking sheet and freeze them until they're completely hard again. Then you can add them to the punch.
 Set out punch glasses so guests can serve themselves or pour the punch into glasses that you can garnish. Consider sprinkling the drinks with blue edible pearls or blue sprinkles.For extra texture, you could also top the drinks with mini-marshmallows.

 The possibility of a flat spot on the back of your baby’s skull is insignificant compared to your opportunity to greatly reduce the threat of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a terrifying condition in which a child under age one dies in his or her sleep for no determinable reason.Always place your infant to sleep on her back, on a firm mattress in an unoccupied, approved crib, with no pillows, blankets, toys, or loose clothing on or near the baby. Pacifiers are acceptable and may even be helpful in preventing SIDS.
The American Academy of Pediatrics’ “Back Is Best” campaign helped reduce SIDS deaths by 40%, but unintentionally caused rates of infant flat head to grow as well.;
, Supervise the baby closely at all times. Never leave the room."Tummy time" not only helps prevent flat head, it aids in motor development. It helps babies to strengthen their neck, arm and shoulder muscles.
The AAP has in fact changed its slogan from “Back Is Best” to “Stomach to Play and Back to Sleep” to indicate the importance of “tummy time” to infant development., The more time a baby spends out of the crib, infant seat, and swing, the less pressure is applied to the baby's head.The goal is not only to prevent pressure on the back of the skull, but to give the baby a range of movement that permits development of the neck and shoulder muscles as well.
Infant carriers that strap onto your chest and hold the baby upright while permitting range of motion can be a good choice.Holding your baby often also offers important bonding opportunities.
 Don't leave your baby in the same position or location for long stretches of time. Overuse of swings, infant seats, and bouncers can result in flat spots.Though a tempting option, car carriers, swings, and the like should not be used as long-term holding areas nor sleeping quarters for your infant, because they limit range of motion of the head and neck.Moving your baby around to new locations and new positions frequently also engages her senses, which is essential to infant development.

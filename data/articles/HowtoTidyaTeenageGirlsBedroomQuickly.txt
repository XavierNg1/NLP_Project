 Music will help you clean faster but it's optional.;
, For example your desk, bed, bedside table, closet, etc.
 Making the bed always makes a messy room look cleaner!

, That can be done later. Now put the things where they go!

, Hang clothes up, fold clothes and place shoes neatly at the bottom. Take this opportunity to throw away old clothes and organize your closet.
 Six items per shelf is more than enough.
 Clear away unnecessary papers and just have a laptop/computer, mouse mat, and keyboard. It looks really pretty and effective if you also add about 3 folders, a globe, a big book and a small cuddly toy. Also you can get funky flowers that could make a better replacement for the cuddly toy!

, Have you picked? Once you have, take that many items out from under the bed and put them where they go. Repeat this step until you have completed the task. If you begin to feel like you're getting nowhere with this then make the number higher and continue with this strategy!

, Then get some polish and wipe it down. You might want to do this with dressers/chest of drawers as well.
 Enjoy your newly cleaned room!

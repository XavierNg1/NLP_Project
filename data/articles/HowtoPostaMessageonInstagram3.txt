 Hashtags (‘#’ attached to a word or phrase) are a basic symbol code that groups together posts with the same tag so they can be archived and accessed conveniently later. You can add hashtags to a post or comment by simply typing the ampersand symbol with an identifying term after. For instance, you might hashtag a photo of your noon meal “#chickensalad,” “#bistro” or “#cleaneating.”Pressing or clicking on a hashtag will take you to a separate page where all posts that use that hashtag are grouped together.People sometimes use hashtags ironically or humorously, but that is not their intended purpose. Hashtags are for keeping track of the subject matter of various content.
 Use the “@” symbol followed by a username (i.e. @oprahwinfrey) to tag that user in a post or comment you want them to see. Instagram will automatically link their profile to the post in question and send them a notification that they’ve been tagged. This feature is useful if you wish to address a specific person or bring something to someone’s attention that they might not have otherwise seen.Be certain that you spell the username of the person you’re trying to tag correctly. If you make a mistake, the app won’t register the user and they won’t be sent a notification.
 One of Instagram’s newer features allows you to share posts with other users directly and privately. Locate the arrow icon below the post you want to share, then choose who to send it to on the scrolling bar that appears at the bottom of the screen. The user will be able to access the post from their direct message inbox so that you don’t have to tag them publicly.Direct sharing is more expedient way of sending content to friends than tagging them in posts.

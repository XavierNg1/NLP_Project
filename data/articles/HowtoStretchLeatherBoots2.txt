If you do not have any thick socks, put on two to four layers of normal socks.
Having a thicker layer of socks will make it easier to stretch the leather further.
 Force the boots onto your feet over the socks.


Note that this will likely feel very uncomfortable, but this short-term discomfort will lead to greater long-term comfort.
If you find it impossible to fit your leather boots on over the socks, remove a layer of socks or opt for a slightly thinner pair.
 Any problem area in need of stretching should be heated with a hair dryer, set to high heat, for at least 30 seconds.


Flex and stretch your feet inside the boots as you heat them up to stretch the leather out further.
Make sure that each problem area receives 30 seconds of heat.
 Turn the hair dryer off but keep the boots on your feet until the outside feels room temperature when touched.


If you remove the boots before they cool, they will likely shrink back down.
 Once cool, strip the socks from your feet and try your boots on again. If they feel comfortable, keep them as they are.


If the boots still feel tight, repeat the process a couple more times, wearing a thicker layer of socks each time.
 Rub a shoe cream or shoe polish over the leather when done to replenish the lost moisture.

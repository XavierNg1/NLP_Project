 Sow your Moss Rose seeds indoors about six weeks before you expect the last frost in your area. If you would prefer not to grow your plants inside to begin with, wait until after the last frost has passed and then sow the seeds directly into your garden.


If your area doesn’t experience frost, you can sow your seeds around March.;
, The spot should get full sun throughout the day. The soil should drain well as Moss Rose’s do not enjoy soggy feet.Because Moss Roses prefer well-draining soil, avoid planting these plants in clay soil.
 Moss Rose seeds are very tiny, so take care not to over-sow them as this will eventually crowd the plants and may cause some plants to die off. Some gardeners mix the very fine Moss Rose seeds with sand to make the seeds easier to sow.


Sow the seeds so that they are about eight inches apart. Cover the seeds up with about ⅛ of an inch of fine compost.
 Use a fine watering spout to water your seeds. Using a fine watering spout is important because a heavy spray could wash away the seeds and young seedlings.

 You'll need fake leather or very thin real leather, a box cutter, strong glue, a button, tread and a strong needle, and scissors.
 You'll need a pattern for a large equilateral triangle. Search "equilateral triangle" on Google Images in order to get an image you can print out to use as a template.
 Place the pattern on the wrong side of your leather, trace it, and cut it out very carefully with the box cutter.
 Fold the top point down to the center of the bottom edge and then fold one of the sides over to cover it. The unfolded side will become the opening flap.
 Mark the point that is create opposite of the flap. Sew the button onto the nice side of the leather, centered about 2 centimeter (0.8Â in) from what would be the very tip of that point.
 Glue the two folded over pieces together to create the pouch. The button piece should end up on top so that the tip of the flap can be folded down to meet it.
 Cut a slit in the flap tip to create a button hole.
 You can add designs with gold paint or glue trim around the opening to hide the uneven edges if you want to.
 You can now use your coin purse!

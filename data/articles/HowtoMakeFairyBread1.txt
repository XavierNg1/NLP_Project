 Fairy bread is traditionally made with plain, fluffy white bread. However, feel free to mix it up by using another type of bread per your preference.You can cut off the crusts, or leave them on, according to your preference. If you are making fairy bread for kids, consider taking off the crust.;
, Soften the butter, first, so that it is easy to spread. Lay down a thin layer of butter that covers every square millimetre of the bread surface. Make sure to use enough that the sprinkles will stick.Feel free to use margarine or another non-dairy butter. You can even use Nutella spread, for a twist. Traditional fairy bread, however, is made with dairy butter.
 It is traditional to slice each piece of bread in half, into two equally-sized triangles. However, feel free to get creative and use any shape you want.Try hewing the bread into circles, hearts, stars, or any other shape that catches your fancy. Use cookie cutters for any easy job, or design your own shapes with a sharp knife.

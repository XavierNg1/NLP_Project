 While there is no official difference between almond flour and almond meal, the unofficial difference is that flour contains blanched almonds and meal contains almonds with the skins still intact.Therefore, if you decide to make almond meal or have a recipe that calls for meal, it may be preferable to make it using whole, sprouted almonds instead of blanched, sprouted almonds.
 Almond meal is generally (again, unofficially) supposed to be coarser than almond flour. If you pulsed your almond flour for 45 seconds, only pulse your meal for 30 seconds.
 Unused, room temperature almond meal can become rancid when it oxygenates for too long.

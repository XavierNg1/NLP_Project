 Whether you are successful or not is not only defined by any one particular outcome or quality. You are a brother, a son, a friend, a student, a football player, a citizen of this country. List all roles you can think of.


You might be doing better in some roles than others. This is natural and to be expected.
 Think about the quality of your relationships or the number of roles you have. What do you think makes you successful? Think about the effort you are putting into all of these roles. Remember that you will always have ups and downs in life.
 You might have to think about your actions, the quality of your relationship with others, your performance, or other aspects of your role.Here are some examples of success in different roles:


As a citizen: you make sure you recycle.
As a son: you speak politely to your dad.
As a football player: you attend all of your practice sessions with the team and encourage your teammates to improve.
 Think about how you successful you are in your different roles by asking yourself some questions. Are those who depend on you satisfied and happy? Do you feel that you are living up to your ideals?


Ask others for their opinions on your success. There may be people you engage with in different roles.
For example, ask your mother how you’re doing as a son, or ask your boss how you’re doing as a recently hired employee. Other people may tell you things about your performance that might surprise you.
 Do you think you can be a better son by taking care of your mother? Do you think you can be a better friend by being more reliable? Think of things you can do to improve your success in these roles.


Remember that success in your roles is malleable; it depends on how you define it and whether you want to change to reach the ideals you set for yourself.

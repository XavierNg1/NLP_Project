 This method sacrifices one piece of paper to help you get another piece just right. You'll need two pieces of paper for this method — one that you want to fold well and one that you don't mind ruining. Your two pieces of paper should be the same size.









Get your "scratch" paper into rough thirds any way you wish — you may want to use the "intuitive" method above or one of the others in this article. You can even use trial-and-error to get your folds right.
 Now, make adjustments to your scratch paper until you have it folded into near-perfect thirds.









Do not worry about how many times this takes or how many unsightly creases you make — this paper doesn't "count."

, Once you are satisfied with the folds in your scratch paper, take the now-folded blank sheet and line it up with the edge of the paper you want to fold well. Use the scratch paper as a blueprint for the folds you make in your "good" sheet of paper.









You can do this by marking the positions of the folds on the "good" paper or using your eyes to visually compare the two sheets.
 If you want, you can take a straight edge (even something as simple as your envelope) and lay it over the two sheets to help you mark the folds from your scratch paper on your "good" paper. If you're using a sturdy straight edge, you can even fold your "good" paper over it for precision.









When you're done, save your "scratch" paper for note-taking or recycle it. Don't send perfectly good paper to a landfill.

 Dictionaries, phone books, and encyclopedias are excellent choices for pressing flowers. The moisture from the flowers will cause the pages to wrinkle, so be sure to choose books that can be damaged.
 You will need four pieces of paper, two of which will serve as blotters. Place two sheets of paper on either side of the book.
 Using the directions outlined above, choose flowers to lay flat or arrange artistically. You are only limited by the size of the book.
 Be careful to close it in such a way that the flower arrangement does not get disturbed, and the paper stays aligned with the book.









If you have a lot of flowers, you can place more flowers at different parts of the book. Make sure to leave about half an inch (1.3 cm) between the pages so your flowers don't transfer moisture to the other flowers in the book. Too many will cause mold.
Pile more heavy books on top of the pressing book, and store them in a dry place in your house.
 Carefully open the book to the pages where you're pressing flowers and remove the under sheets of paper you are using as blotters. Replace them with fresh blotter sheets, close the books, and continue to let the flowers press.
 After a few weeks, the flowers will be completely dry. Gently open the layers of paper and gently remove the flowers preferably with a pair of tweezers. You can use your fingers but be very careful. They are very delicate now.

 In some cases, the tooth may not have passed, or you may be experiencing one of the above-mentioned symptoms. When one of these things occurs, it may be time to see a doctor.
 Having as much information as possible ready for the doctor will make the process easier and increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome. Have the following information ready:


How large is the tooth? Is it a molar? An incisor? Is the tooth whole or is it broken into pieces?
What home remedies have you already tried?
What symptoms are you experiencing, i.e. pain, nausea, vomiting?
Have you experienced a change in your bowel movements?
How long has it been since it happened?
How did it happen and what were you eating? Did you try drinking any liquids?
Did symptoms appear gradually or suddenly? Are there any health risks the doctor needs to know about, such as preexisting medical conditions?

, It’s important to take seriously what your doctor tells you. Even seemingly minor things such as swallowing a tooth can result in serious problems, which can be exacerbated by not following a doctor’s instructions.

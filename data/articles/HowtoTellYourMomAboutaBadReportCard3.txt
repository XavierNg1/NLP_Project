 Throughout the semester, check your grades at least once every week. This will allow you to identify potential problems before your final report card is issued. When you notice your grade starting to slip, be proactive. Ask your teacher if you can retake the test, do extra-credit, or turn in late/missing work.


If you don’t have access to a computer or the internet, ask your teachers for a grade update each week.
 In addition to checking your grades consistently, you should also update your mom on a regular basis. Let her know how you are doing in your courses. When you ace a test, share that with her; when you bomb an assignment, let her know you are struggling. If you keep your mom informed about your grades, your final grades won’t shock her., Every parent reacts differently to their child’s bad report card. Some are caring and understanding, while others resort to physical violence. If you are afraid that your mom will react negatively, please confide in a teacher, principal, or trusted adult. Allow them to help you with this difficult situation.

 If your grand exchange boxes are filled, do some player to player businesses. Get some new clothes in Varrock and a brand new hair style in Falador. Make people think that you know what you're doing and you'll do it right. Talk with an attitude that everyone likes. Carry some money, make yourself look like a big-shot!;
, When most players want some extra GP, they always play it safe. It might take awhile, but they still get the money. What if you can't wait? What if you have little time left? If I'm playing already, why not play it quick and safe? You've got to play smart.
 Pretty soon you'll be hiring and firing people to work for you. Don't just go and gather 50 people. Get to know everyone around you. You have got to really know them. If you don't have enough time, than do what Donald J. Trump once said, "Get the best people, and don't trust them!"

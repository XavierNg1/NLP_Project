 Pick a color scheme or have all the materials be the same color. Find something that fits your sense of style. You can mix and match materials, like using lace and suede rope, to create a unique look. There are many different types of material you can use to make a braided headband.Suede rope
Lace
Leather rope
Hemp cord
Gold or Silver chain

, You want the rope to be long enough to go around your head, be tied in a knot, and have some left to hang down a bit. Wrap the rope around your head to measure your head, and then double the length. Cut all the ropes the same length.
 Take three ropes and tie them together with a knot at the top of the ropes. Use something to stabilize the knot as you braid the ropes. You can use a clipboard by putting the knot under the clip of the clipboard, use your feet to hold the knot, tape the knot to a table, or have someone else to hold the knot still as you braid.Braid the ropes until there is only about two inches left.
Then, tie a knot with the ropes to secure the braid.
 To wear your braided headband, wrap it around your head starting in the front and wrapping the headband toward the back of your head. Tie the headband in a knot at the back of your head. There will be extra headband hanging down beyond the knot.


Embellish your headband by clipping on feather hair clips or bows.

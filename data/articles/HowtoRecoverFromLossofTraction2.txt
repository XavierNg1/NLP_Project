Take your foot off the gas. Put the vehicle in neutral. This will allow the car to gradually slow down. Put the vehicle back in an appropriate gear once the vehicle regains traction.
Refrain from steering the vehicle. The skidding of the tires will help the vehicle slow down. As the vehicle slows, the car will pick up traction again. As the vehicle slows down, turn the steering wheel in the direction you want the vehicle to go.

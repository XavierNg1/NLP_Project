 In addition to the handrail, you will need at least two sets of brackets and screws. You will also need a drill to complete the installation, and a saw if you intend to cut your own returns.


Remember that for a wall-mounted installation, the handrail should be 8 inches longer than your measurements, to account for the 4-inch returns you'll cut off on either end.
If you buy a ready-made handrail, it will likely come with brackets and screws, too. If not, purchase brackets intended for a handrail installation.
 Use a saw to cut the ends (approximately 4 inches from each end) from the railing at a 45-degree angle.Once you've installed the handrail, the returns will be attached to either end to serve as hand grips.

Reverse the placement of the cuts so that the pieces will be able to face the wall at the top and bottom of the rail.
You may want to ask an employee at the hardware store to cut the returns for you if you aren't handy with a saw.
 Line up the brackets and use a drill to mount them to the wall Repeat until all brackets are securely installed.Be sure that the brackets are vertically plumb before drilling them into place.

It's important to make sure that the brackets are installed securely. If they seem loose in the wall, the handrail may not be sturdy enough to support people's weight as they use it.
You may want to purchase extra brackets to ensure that the handrail will be held securely in place.
 Hold the railing in position against the wall along the length of the chalk line. Secure the handrail into its position on the brackets by placing screws into the holes drilled on the railingâ€™s underside.

Loosely-secured railings are a serious hazard issue, so be sure that the rail can bear the weight that will be imposed on it daily.
If the railing is loose, reinforce the railing from below by applying a metal corner bracket there., Place the angled edge of the return against the end of the rail. The flat end of the return should rest against the wall, forming a hand grip. Use wood glue and apply it to the cut edges before securing the return to the rail. Hold it in place for a few minutes to ensure it is securely attached. Repeat with the other return on the other end of the rail. For extra enforcement, hammer in 2-3 nails to connect the returns to the rails.
You may need to shorten the returns by an inch or two to ensure that they fit securely against the wall.

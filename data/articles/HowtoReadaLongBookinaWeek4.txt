 To really “sink into” a good book, you must first find a comfortable spot. Try different locations around your home to see what relaxes you the most. Try some of these spots:


A quiet, infrequently used room.
A sunny spot outside.
In the bath.
The living room on your favorite couch.
 If you sit in bed and try to read for pleasure, you might make yourself so relaxed you will fall asleep. Avoid reading right before bed as you will teach your body that reading means that it is time to sleep.Furthermore, reading on a backlit screen (like an ereader, phone, or tablet) may make it harder to fall asleep!, Just like having to read for an assignment, you should also schedule yourself to read for pleasure. Sometimes, it is easy to occupy yourself with work and other activities.Look at your daily or weekly schedule and block out a space that is just dedicated to reading. This will also assuage any guilt you might feel by reading for fun rather than accomplishing something else!


Try blacking-out or writing on a calendar that you intend to read. This will give a visual reminder to you and anyone trying to schedule appointments with you. For example, on a calendar, mark out a day and time you want to spend reading. Pick a day of the week, like Tuesday, and an hour you are free, say 12-1pm, and commit yourself to reading each week at that hour.
 If you enjoy reading, do not let it become something you give up because something else comes up. If you have scheduled time to read, then read. If you are having a stressful day and would rather do something else, force yourself to read for a short period of time. Chances are, it will help to de-stress you and help calm you down.


By committing yourself to reading, you will more likely read more and more quickly.
Scientists suggest that it takes 21 days to break or build a habit. Try and a keep consistent reading habit for 21 days to ingrain reading as a daily habit.

 Using your PCâ€™s file browser, navigate through your folders until you locate the file you want to open.
 Do this by double-clicking it. Excel will automatically launch when you open an Excel document on your computer.
 At the lower-left corner of the worksheet are some tabs. These tabs can either be labeled Sheet1, Sheet2, etc., or renamed to a name you prefer. Click on the sheet you will insert rows into.
 To insert nonadjacent rows, hold down the CTRL key and select nonadjacent rows by left-clicking on your mouse.
 A context menu will pop out.

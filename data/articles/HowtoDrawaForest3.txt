 If you want a grassy forest, draw some spikes that vary in size and direction.
 If the tree is closer, make it larger. If it is farther away, make it smaller and behind the ones that are closer, to add perspective to your drawing.
 For plants, you could add some mushrooms, bark textures, bushes and small plants. For animals, add insects, mammals, maybe even an owl or two. If you'd like to add people, you could include children collecting acorns or picking berries.
 Remember that the trees behind the ones in front are in the shadows and gradually make it a darker color. Color shadows, spots that you want to be bright, and other little features.

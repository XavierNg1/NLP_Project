 Timing is everything when it comes to good poached eggs.









All the different parts of the meal, such as toast, meats and hash browns, should be finished at the same time.
If cooking for a few people, it may be necessary to keep the other parts of the meal warm in the oven, a sunny window or a container on top of a pan of hot water. This is fine, but always do the eggs last. You will be amazed at how quickly three minutes goes by. While you are messing around pouring your juice, the perfectly poached egg becomes a hard-boiled egg in the blink of an eye.

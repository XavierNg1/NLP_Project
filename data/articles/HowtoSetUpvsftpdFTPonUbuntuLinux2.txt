Allowed values: Boolean
Default value: NO

, By default the server will pretend to allow ASCII mode but in fact ignore the request. Turn on the below options to have the server actually do ASCII mangling on files when in ASCII mode. Beware that on some FTP servers, ASCII support allows a denial of service attack (DoS) via the command "SIZE /big/file" in ASCII mode. vsftpd predicted this attack and has always been safe, reporting the size of the raw file. ASCII mangling is a horrible feature of the protocol.

Allowed values: Boolean
Default value: NO

, If you want, you can arrange for uploaded anonymous files to be owned by a different user. Note! Using "root" for uploaded files is not recommended!

Default value: NO for deny_email_enable and /etc/vsftpd.banned_emails for banned_email_file

,

Allowed values: Boolean
Default value: NO

, You may specify an explicit list of local users to chroot() to their home directory. If chroot_local_user is YES, then this list becomes a list of users to NOT chroot().

Allowed values: File path string for chroot_list_file and Boolean for chroot_list_enable
Default value: NO for chroot_list_enable and /etc/vsftpd.chroot_list for chroot_list_file

, This is disabled by default to avoid remote users being able to cause excessive I/O on large sites. However, some broken FTP clients such as "ncftp" and "mirror" assume the presence of the "-R" option, so there is a strong case for enabling it.

Allowed values: Boolean
Default value: NO

, Some of vsftpd's settings don't fit the Debian filesystem layout by default. These settings are more Debian-friendly. This option should be the name of a directory which is empty. Also, the directory should not be writable by the ftp user. This directory is used as a secure chroot() jail at times vsftpd does not require file system access.

Allowed values: File path string
Default value: /usr/share/empty

,

Allowed values: string
Default value: ftp

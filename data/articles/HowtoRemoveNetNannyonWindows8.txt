 Go to your local store and by a simple flash drive. Preferably one with  a lot of storage on it, you are going to need it so you don't lose any files you want to keep. ;
, Once you got your flash drive, you need to add all the files that you need to keep. You won't lose work documents and such, but it's a good idea to add them just in case.


After you've added your files, you are going to want to remove the flash drive and keep it in a safe place.
 You will see under your search bar a box around files. With an unboxed selection of an app search or a settings search. Switch it to a settings search.
 You need to click to the search bar and type that as it stands. You will get two options. One saying remove everything and reboot windows, the other saying refresh your pc. Choose the refresh option and follow the instructions.
 When your PC finally reboots after the refresh. Add all the files on your flash drive back the way they were. Make sure you carefully put everything in the right spot or else you can get corrupt files.
 If NetNanny is still present. Restart your PC and it should be gone.

 It can be anything - a sketchpad or old notebook or even a few sheets of paper bundled together! Anything with lots of pages to draw and write in.;
, Do you like emo culture or girly stuff? Well, in your expressive journal you can write whatever you want. Like poetry? Write a heart-felt poem about your crush perhaps! Like anime? Sketch some of your favourite anime characters! The list is endless!

, Draw yourself however you want. Maybe your parents won't let you have a tattoo you really want, why not draw yourself with it?!

, If you're feeling happy draw something that makes you happy. It's not only a lot of fun but it helps you draw better!

, Do you hate someone or something a lot? Maybe it's a bully? Why not draw the bully in an ugly way with a big cross over him or her. You'll feel a lot better.
 Perhaps draw a comic strip of something funny that happened that day.

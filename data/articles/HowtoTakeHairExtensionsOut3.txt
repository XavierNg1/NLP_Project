 Use a hair clip or tie to pull all of your hair together except for one section. Find the first and closest section of artificial hair at the bottom of your head. You want to start at the bottom and work your way up so you know where you’ve already removed extensions.
 Oil helps break up any chemical bonds from glue or tape. Use either almond oil, coconut oil, baby oil, olive oil, or a hair salon product specifically for removing extensions. Dab or gently rub the oil into the extension bond and wait for the bond to break down.The oil needs time to seep into the bonds to break them down. Wait at least 15 minutes or even more time for thick tape or glue bonds.Make sure you set aside time to remove your extensions. You don’t want to be caught off guard with half a head of fake hair that you didn’t have time to finish removing.
 Rinse your hair thoroughly and then coat your entire head in conditioner. Work the conditioner into your roots and the tape or glue bonds. Wrap your head in a towel and wait 20 minutes. After unwrapping, use a wide toothed comb to gently comb out your extensions.


This can help remove stubborn bonds if using oil did not remove your extensions completely.
Comb from the tips of your hair and work your way up to the roots so that you don’t tangle you natural and fake hair together, which makes combing out the fake hair more difficult and painful.
 For each section, it may take several repetitions of applying oil or wrapping your hair in a towel to remove all of the glue. Work through each section of hair entirely before letting down another section of your from your ponytail or hair clip. Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo and nourishing conditioner afterwards.

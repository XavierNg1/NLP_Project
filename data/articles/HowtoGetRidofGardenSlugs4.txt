 You can create a slug killing spray by making a solution of ammonia and water. Mix 1 part plain household ammonia with 6 parts water. Pour this into a spray bottle, and spritz it onto the slugs whenever you see them. Just be careful not to use it directly on the plants, as over time it might burn the leaves.
 These small slug-killing pellets can be found in garden centers, for spreading around your yard. The slugs are attracted to them, but once consumed will cause their deaths within a week. This treatment is safe for most pets and edible plants, but it may still be a good idea to minimize use.Commercial names include Sluggo, Slug Magic, and Escar-Go.
 Metaldehyde is a common anti-slug treatment, but it has its limitations.Notably, metaldehyde can be very poisonous to pets (especially dogs).Proper handling and placement of this bait is essential to avoid a dangerous situation for family pets.


Avoid "pellet" form metaldehyde, which can be mistaken for pet treats. Use "granule" form instead.
Store the metaldehyde somewhere dogs cannot get to it.
Do not apply the treatment near edible plants.
Spread the metaldehyde thinly, never in piles, which pets can mistake for food.
Metaldehyde works best on warm, dry days, but cannot be used in sunlight. Apply underneath leaves in the evening before a warm weather forecast.
Look for low-dose metaldehyde products with less environmental impact.

 Bats are available in both wood and metal versions, with the metal bats often made of titanium or aluminum. The grips on the bats may also be different, as well as the length. Typically, longer bats are appropriate for players who are a little taller, while shorter bats are easier for children or teenagers to manage effectively.;
, Should the bat be for use by an amateur or professional baseball club, there are usually specific standards set by baseball leagues that help to determine the length and type of bats that can be used during a game. Obtain copies of those standards, and use them to focus attention on bats that are in compliance with those standards and regulations.
 Most sporting goods stores and other outlets that sell baseball bats have access to a chart that takes into consideration factors such as age, gender and height to determine the ideal length and size of bat. Unless you are familiar with how to properly match the size of a bat with a player, making use of those charts is a good idea.
 Like many other types of goods, quality will vary from one baseball bat manufacturer to another. Spend some time checking consumer reports and comments found at online forums regarding different makes and models. This will help you get a better idea if the bats made by certain companies are likely to hold up well or are not worth the asking price.
 Many stores have floor models that can be tested for swinging, gripping and other basics involved in batting. Trying the floor model before settling on a specific brand and size will make it easier to choose the right one the first time.

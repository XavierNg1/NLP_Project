 Go through your windup normally, with a normal fastball motion until you reach your release point. The knuckleball should look like a fastball until the pitcher reveals the ball right before his release. You don't want to tip your pitches to the batter.








Don't alter your arm slot or anything else. This can reduce the chance your knuckleball will knuckle and end up as a soft lob.
 This is essential to getting minimal amount of spin. Throwing a fastball, you usually move your wrist down as you release the ball, creating steady spin on the ball and causing it to travel straight, more or less. Throwing a knuckleball, you try to do the opposite, because you don't want spin.








Extend your fingertips out as you release the ball. This will minimize spin.
Try to let your knuckles be the topmost point of your hand as you release. Having your knuckles at the very top of your hand will ensure that less spin is created when you release the ball.
 Let the ball slip through your hands by releasing your thumb from the grip. Follow through and end as if you are throwing any other pitch.

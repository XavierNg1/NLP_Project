 Go to www.reverbnation.com/signup, and create an account either by using your Facebook (if you do this, skip step 3) or by entering an e-mail address and password.
 For a band or musical act, select “Artist.”

, On the next page after selecting the type of account you want, and just below where it asks to add your profile picture, it says “Sync Social Networks.” Click “Sync” next to it, and log into your personal Facebook account.
 Just below the social networks, click “Install” right next to “Free Facebook Artist App.”

, Accept some permissions to allow ReverbNation to access your Facebook page and to manage it. Also, what audience would ReverbNation allow it to post? More than likely, for a band, you’ll want to post publicly.
 Continue with the profile creation.

 In addition to making sure your sitter is ready to care for your dog, you’ll need to do your best to get your pup ready for your vacation. Before you leave, spend extra time with your dog. Go for longer walks, sleep in late, and spend extra time playing fetch or tug of war. Whatever you like to do with your dog, spend some extra time with it so you’ll both feel better about your being away for vacation., This is essential. You can never know for sure how a dog will react to a person in their home when you’re away. However, the better acquainted your dog is with their sitter, the less likely they are to react poorly. If at all possible, have your sitter visit your home when you’re not there after the initial introduction to your dog to ensure the pup will respond positively to them when you’re away., This allows your dog to get used to you being gone. It will decrease your dog’s stress or anxiety when you’re away for the vacation. Start by going out for dinner directly after work. Then, stay overnight with a friend. If your sitter can feed or care for the dog while you take this extra time away that’s even better. Your dog will learn that, even if you’re gone for what feels like a long time, you always come back. This is important to prevent separation anxiety., If you can’t bring yourself to leave your pup at home, consider choosing a pet-friendly hotel and bringing your pup along. You can also plan pet-friendly vacations like hiking or camping. If you’re traveling by plane, you can even arrange to take your pet along. Contact your airline or check the website for their pet travel guidelines.

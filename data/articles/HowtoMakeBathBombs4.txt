 This version includes dried herbs and flowers directly in the bath bombs for a pretty, natural appearance. You will need:


1.75 oz (50 g) citric acid
3 oz (100 g) bicarbonate of soda or baking soda
Essential oils or some old perfume, several drops
Water, to moisten
Food coloring (optional)
Dried herbs or petals (optional)
Cosmetic glitter (optional)

, Add to the bowl.


You should be able to find citric acid from wine making suppliers or supermarkets. Baking soda or bicarbonate of soda can be found in a standard baking aisle.
Make a well with your fingers in the middle of the bowl after mixing the two ingredients together.
 You can also use old perfume. Add about 5 sprays of perfume or 5 drops of oil. Then pour in the food coloring, dried herbs or petals and cosmetic glitter, if you want them.

If adding glitter, it must be cosmetic glitter. Do not use craft glitter.
 With your fingertips, mix the mixture in the bowl, making sure there are no food coloring lumps in the mixture.

Citric acid can irritate exposed skin.
 Use a spray bottle filled with lukewarm water. This binds it all together.

If the mixture doesn't hold together after spraying it, try spritzing it once or twice more. Continue until you feel it is held together perfectly.
 After you have sprayed the mixture, it starts to harden, so you need to be quick. Pick up little handfuls of the bath bomb mixture and compress it down into large dome molds or silicone ice cube tray holes.

Layer the mixture on top of the last layer. Push down hard to get the best results.
 The next day, they should be dry. When they are, you can push out your bath bombs and use them!

Use within several months.

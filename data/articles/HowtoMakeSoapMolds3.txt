 A clam mold can be a fun, creative shape if you want to do something a little different than round or square-shaped cuts. You will need a few seashells, large enough to contain about half a cup of liquid soap. You can purchase seashells online or at a craft store. If you live near the ocean, you can collect seashells yourself.If you're using seashells you find, scrub thoroughly with antibacterial soap and rinse before use., Once your seashells are chosen and prepared, pour the liquid soap into each shell. Set the shell on a flat surface and, if necessary, hold the shell down to prevent spilling. Do not fill the seashell to the brim. Leave about half an inch of wiggle room at the top., Take some plastic wrap. Wrap each mold in a few layers of plastic wrap, making sure to use enough layers prevent outside air from getting in and to keep the soap from leaking., Once the molds are secured in plastic wrap, place the shells in a box. You can use any box you can find, like a shoebox. Cover the box with plastic wrap. This helps insulate the soap, quickening the drying process., Choose a safe place, away from children or animals, where the box is unlikely to be disturbed. Your soap recipe should indicate how long the soap should take to try. Usually, it takes around 24 to 28 hours., After 24 to 48 hours, remove each mold from the shells. Place the shells on a drying rack. They should be fully dry in 4 to 8 weeks.

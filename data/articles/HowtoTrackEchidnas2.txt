 Wherever you find ant or termite nests, if there are signs of digging around or in the nests, then you have probably located an area where echidnas are.
 Echidnas tend to tear off the bark in long strips, usually from logs.
 Echidnas that are using the are for finding ants or termites may dig in places other than ant or termite nests. However, they don't only eat ants and termites. They're quite happy to eat other creatures such as earthworms, beetles and moth larvae, so scrounging with their sharp claws may occur anywhere.

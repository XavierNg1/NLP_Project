, You can save time, water, and detergent by adding all of your baby's other items into the washing machine as well.Do not use a dishwasher., You can use whatever detergent your normally use to wash your baby's cloths, but it would be much better if you use a gentle, baby-safe detergent, however. This is because babies have sensitive skin and can get rashes from regular detergents., Select your desire water temperature, then set the cycle to gentle. Let the cycle start and complete.How long this takes depends on the type of washing machine you have. It should typically only take around 30 minutes or so.
 Once the cycle ends, take the WubbaNub out of the washing machine, and hang it up in a well-ventilated area. Allow it to air dry completely before handing it back to your baby.


If you washed your baby's clothes and blankets in the same load, you can let those air dry as well, or you can toss them into the dryer. The WubbaNub must be air dried, however; do not put it into the dryer.

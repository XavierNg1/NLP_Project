 For instance, you should eat fruit in the morning, carbs at noon and protein at dinner. This is because digesting fruit is very quick whilst protein takes a long time.
 And between each meal drink as much water as possible. Drinking water not only helps fill your stomach up a little, but it gets your metabolism working. Drink cold water too. When you drink cold water, your body must heat it up. This burns calories and trains your metabolism to be faster.
 And don't lie to yourself on the application. You are trying to improve, not lie to a machine. Make sure you enter whatever you eat, as you will feel more guilty about eating the snack and it will help you to stop snacking unhealthy foods.
 Whenever you have the opportunity, do some workout sessions. Even if you can only do 5 minutes a day. It is better than 0 minutes a day. DO different types of exercise, like walking or cycling to work or school. Play tennis with friends. Anything that gets you moving. And make sure to enter the amount of fitness you do on your app, this makes you feel better about it and you will want to do it again.

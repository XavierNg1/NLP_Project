 This braid is different, because the braid is along the back of your head and ends in a fun bun. To start this braid off you'll need to flip your hair over, and brush out your hair., Next, start with a small, middle section of hair at the nape of your neck and begin to french braid up your hair, creating a somewhat thin french braid along the back of your head until you reach the crown of your head.You want this french braid to be somewhat small, because you want it to blend in somewhat with the rest of your hair. A very thick french braid will stick out from the rest of your head and could look weird from the side.
 Once you have reached the crown of your head, stop braiding, and secure the end of your braid with an elastic. You'll then have a large portion of hair left that is not braided., Taking the hair leftover from your braid and the rest of your hair on your head, pull it to the top of your head and wrap around the elastic you previously used, creating a bun. Secure with bobby pins or another elastic., After you've secured your hair, flip your head back over and you should have a nice french braid on the back of your head with a neat bun to top it off. If you find your hair bun is too tight, you can always loosen it up by pulling hair loosely on the sides of your head.

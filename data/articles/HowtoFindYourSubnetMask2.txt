, On the "System Preferences" window, the Network icon looks like a grey ball on most versions of Mac OS X. If you can't find it, type Network in the search bar on the upper right of the System Preferences window.

If you should be connected online, try selecting "Using DHCP" from the "Configure IPv4" drop-down menu, then pressing Renew DHCP Lease.

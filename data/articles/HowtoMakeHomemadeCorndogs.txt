If you prefer a sweeter batter, increase the sugar by 1/8 cup. For a less sweet batter, increase the cornmeal by 1/8 cup.;
,, Use a pan deep enough to accommodate 2 to 3 hot dogs at a time and roomy enough so that they can be completely submerged without touching each other.
 The wood skewers will remain in the hot dogs from cooking through serving.
 Hold the protruding end of the skewer and swirl the hot dogs in the batter until they are well-coated.


For easier coating, fill a drinking glass with batter and dip the hot dogs into the glass.






Make mini-corn dogs by cutting the hot dogs into thirds or quarters and using toothpicks for skewers.
 Gently insert a couple of the coated hot dogs one at a time into the hot oil. Add them to the oil carefully to prevent spattering as the hot oil will burn skin. Cook the corn dogs approximately 3 minutes, until they are a golden shade of brown.
 Set them on paper towels to drain.
 Serve the corn dogs with condiments such as ketchup and mustard.

 Your mood can influence how tired you are. If you are down or keeping to yourself, you may feel sleepy. Instead, try to talk and interact with friends or classmates when you can to help keep you happy and excited.Don’t talk to your friends during class because you may get in trouble. Instead, talk to them between classes, during lunch, and during any downtime.
 Going to sleep and waking up at the same time each day can help your body set up a rhythm of sleeping and staying awake. This can help you not want to sleep during class. Instead, your body will know that it is time to be awake and alert.Teenagers should get between eight and ten hours of sleep, while young adults should get seven to nine.You should keep this sleep routine even on the weekends. This helps train your body and discourages you from feeling tired on Mondays during class.
 Regular exercise helps boost your energy levels and fight fatigue. If you are always sedentary and don’t move, that can lead to feeling tired and sleepy. Start exercising at least a few days each week to keep you from crashing in class.Try to get half an hour of exercise four to five days each week. If you’ve never exercised before, start with three days.
Any kind of physical activity can help with your energy levels. Walking, cycling, strength training, swimming, dancing, or yoga will help fight fatigue.

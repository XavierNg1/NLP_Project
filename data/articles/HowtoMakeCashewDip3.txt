 Fill a large bowl or pot with approximately 2 cups (473 ml) of hot water. Add 1 cup (125 g) of raw cashews and allow them to soak for at least 30 minutes. Drain the cashews after they’re finished soaking.You don’t need to use boiling water. Hot, filtered water from the tap is warm enough.
 Add the drained cashews, 1 roasted red bell pepper,1 tablespoon (15 ml) of fresh lemon juice, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of apple cider vinegar, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of dry mustard powder, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of smoked paprika, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of garlic powder, 2 tablespoons (14 g) of tahini, 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 ml) of liquid smoke, and salt to taste to the bowl of a food processor. Process the mixture until it is mostly smooth, which should take approximately 15 seconds., Once the mixture is smooth, add water to food processor to thin out the dip. Start with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) and pulse the food processor to incorporate it. If the dip is still too thick, add another tablespoon (15 ml) and repeat.You can continue adding more water to the dip a tablespoon (15 ml) at a time until it reaches the consistency that you like.
 When you’re happy with the consistency of the dip, spoon it into a bowl. Serve it with crudites, chips, or crackers.If you like, you can garnish the top of the dip with chopped roasted red peppers.
The dip is also delicious as a sandwich or wrap spread.

 You definitely don't want your bird to be cramped in a cage that is way to small. You'll want to get the most spacious cage possible, that will fit well into your home.


Many cages are species specific. For example, a finch usually does best in a wide cage where they have room to fly. You want to get a cage that is at least twice as tall and twice as wide as the wingspan of your bird.
Make sure the bars on the cage are not far enough apart that bird will be able to stick its head or body through.
Parrots and birds can feel stressed in a rounded cage. Make sure that your cage is square, rectangle or at least has corners.;
, Some bird cages eventually rust. Stainless steel is a good way to go if you want something that will last for years. Also, birds with very strong beaks won't be able to mess it up.
 Most pet stores sell dishes that will hang from the side of the cage and are made for a bird to perch on. These allow for easy refills and may be more convenient than placing a bowl on the bottom of the cage.
 Some people find that their bird enjoys bathing and they add a third dish, filled with water, for solely that purpose.
 Birds need perches and toys. Birds spend a lot of their time on perches. Place them in varying heights within the cage. Some good toys for your bird are mirrors, ladders, and bells. These keep your bird from becoming bored.
 Under the wire, use a liner, such as paper towel, to catch droppings and make for easier clean up.
 Fill up your bird's food and water dishes, hang up all the toys, and add in your bird!

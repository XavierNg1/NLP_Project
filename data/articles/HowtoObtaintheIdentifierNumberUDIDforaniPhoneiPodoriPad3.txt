 You can use your old iTunes backup files to find your device's UDID, which can be useful if you don't have access to it or can't connect it to iTunes at the moment.
,,,, When you create a backup of your iOS device in iTunes, the backup folder is labeled with the device's UDID. The first backup you created will have just the 40 character UDID, while subsequent backups will have a date appended at the end.
 If there are multiple backups of the same device, right-click the original one.
 This will highlight the entire UDID.
 This will allow you to paste the UDID wherever you need to. Make sure you don't actually rename the folder, or you won't be able to use it to restore your iOS device.

 If you are having a large, formal reception, you could have your DJ or band leader announce your children individually or as a group. Let them walk in to applause and cheers!


Consider letting your children pick the music they would like playing as they walk in.
 Make it a special moment for your new family.This dance could be sweet and emotional, or you could find a favorite family dance song and go wild. Let your children take charge and determine what kind of mood they would like to set, and help them choose a song accordingly.
 As with the ceremony, there are lots of little jobs that can be done at a reception. These tasks can help children feel important and included, as well as giving you one less thing to worry about!If you did not have a guestbook or picture at your ceremony, you could put one out to sign at your reception, and put a child in charge of it.
Have your children come up with a playlist of their favorite songs, or the familyâ€™s favorite songs, for the DJ. An older child could even play DJ for the night if you are having a more informal reception.
A child could be in charge of a gift table or helping guests find their place cards.
The whole family could participate in cutting the cake. Some families have added cake toppers for each member of their family!
Older kids could make a toast, give a speech, read a poem, or say a prayer before the meal.

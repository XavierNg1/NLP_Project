 A good place to find them is on Amazon, or Ebay. Go to "About this Mac" under the Apple menu in your finder. The type of memory will be listed there. If you are able, it is a good idea to get the maximum amount of RAM your machine can run. Technical specifications regarding this amount are available from Apple.;
, Power down your laptop and unplug it. Make sure you are working in a clean, dry, dust-free area.
 Loosen the battery by pulling the sliders back. It will pop up slightly when it releases.
, Place these aside in a container so that they do not get lost.
 The chip is secured by two silver metal clips on either side. With your fingers, gently press these outward. When the clips release, the chip will angle upward slightly, and will slide out with gentle pressure. If you find yourself needing to pull with any substantial force, you probably have not released the chip fully.
 The photo shows the second memory chip after it has released from the clips. Note how it is tilted upward slightly.
 As shown in the photo, your chips have a notch in them that prevents them from being inserted backwards, so do not worry about that. Make sure you align them with the slot angle, and press in firmly but gently. If you need a lot of pressure, you probably have the angle wrong.
 Insert your battery pack. Power your computer on.

 You should sit in a clean room, preferably on a mat or carpeted surface. Rest your hands lightly on your thighs. Try to get comfortable. Close your eyes. Keep your spine straight and concentrate on your normal breath for about three to five minutes., Bring your right hand to your face.Using your right thumb, press gently but firmly on your right nostril to prevent air from flowing into or out of it.


Some practitioners like to bring their middle and index fingers up to rest on their foreheads or on a point between their eyes. Others simply keep their other four fingers curled into the palm.
Keep your left hand on your thigh.
 When you’ve reached maximum lung capacity, hold your breath for a length of time equal to the time it took you to breathe in.


Release your breath in a slow exhalation that is also equal to the amount of time it took you to breathe in.
Once you’ve fully exhaled, uncover your right nostril and return your right hand to your thigh.
 Use your left thumb to close your left nostril by pressing it gently but firmly into the side of your nose. The process should replicate the way you closed your right nostril, but on the opposite side.
 At the top of your inhalation, hold your breath for as long as it took you to inhale. Then, breathe out in a smooth motion. Remove your left thumb from your nose.
 Perform 5-10 inhalations and exhalations through each nostril, alternating each time. In other words, between your left and right nostrils, you should perform a total of 10-20 inhalations and exhalations.


As an alternative, instead of switching nostrils after each individual inhale/exhale cycle, you could try to breathe in and out through your right nostril 10 times in a row, then breathe in and out through your left nostril 10 times in a row.

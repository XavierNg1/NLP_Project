 First, tryout for your school squad. Since you do gymnastics, you are flexible, you can do the jumps and kicks, and you are in shape, you might be able to become a flyer! So, keep up your work if you want this to turn into a real cheerleading career.;
, These girls do lots of tumbling, dancing, and cheering, and it takes up tons of time. If you don't make the school squad, tryout for this because you will always make it and be on a team with girls of your skill ability. Plus, you compete in competitions.
 You need to stretch four times a day, strength train three days a week, do aerobics three days a week, and do cheer drills every day. You need to get a good and strong toe touch, herkie, pike, and tuck jump. Keep your toes pointed and your back straight. Do straddle leg lifts, squats, squat jumps, and anything that strengthens your legs and helps you jump higher. Also do core exercises like crunches and sit ups to strengthen your core for better jumps and tumbling.

 Buy several disposable cameras in the beginning of summer and carry them around with you. When you go out with your friends, take a few snapshots. Buy some cheap stickers, glue sticks, glitter, etc and have fun.
 Borrow books from the library on how to make them, or use online resources. You don't need to spend a fortune on materials––see what's inside your house, at the local thrift store or in online auctions and save money.

 You should feel proud about your grades, and the time you spent studying to get them. However, bragging to your peers about how well you did in class can be bothersome. When you brag, you are emphasizing differences between you and your classmates and friends. This creates distance between you and them, and your peers might start to resent you.When talking about your achievements, highlight commonalities between you and your peers. For example, instead of saying, "I got the highest grade in the class," say, "Like you guys, I worked really hard on this project, and I worked even harder to get the grade that I got."

, Don't go out of your way to inform the teacher about every little thing students do. Instead, use your judgment to decide whether it is important enough to tell your teacher. If it is, then tell your teacher discreetly, instead of outing the person in front of the whole class.Try to remember that it is your teacherâ€™s job to keep every one in line, not yours.
 Don't feel like you need to make major personal changes, or risk your academic success, to get others to like you or stop calling you "teacher's pet." Remember that true acceptance comes from within. Therefore, as long as you accept who you are, what others think of you is a small matter.Plus, what others think about you is out of your control. Instead, focus your energy on bettering yourself and moving forward instead of changing what others think of you.

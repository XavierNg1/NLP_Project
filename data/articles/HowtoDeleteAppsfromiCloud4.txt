 If you no longer wish to have certain apps associated with your account, you can hide them from displaying.


If not saved from a previous session, you will be prompted to sign in using your Apple ID.
 This will take you to a list of apps that have available updates.


On iPad you can skip tapping “Updates” and instead just tap “Purchased”.
 This will take you to list of all apps you have downloaded (paid or not).
 A red “Hide” button will appear.
 The app will be removed from displaying on your purchased apps. Repeat as necessary for any other apps.


This action is purely organizational and does not save any storage space on your device or iCloud account.Hidden apps can be located and re-downloaded as normal in the App Store.

 The first step is to make sure you have the right bait on hand. Rabbits are herbivores. That means you will have to catch them with plants.


You could simply figure out which plants the rabbit is taking from your garden, and use those as bait. If you leave carrots for the rabbit, which is a good idea, grate them because it will set off a stronger smell.Brussel sprouts, corn on the cob, alfalfa, clover, and lettuce are all good baits to use to catch rabbits. Create a trail of the bait leading the rabbit directly up to the trap or to your hand. Rabbits also like cabbage.;
, Although rabbits mostly like grasses, leafy greens, and root vegetables, they also enjoy some types of fruit.


You could use dried or fresh red apples to try to catch a rabbit. Either version should work.Rabbits also like bananas. If you have another rabbit, bringing rabbit droppings will attract a new rabbit.
Spray apple cider with a spray bottle throughout the inside of the rabbit trap.The rabbit will be drawn by the apple scent, but the spray will also cover up human scent.
 Stray rabbits are often dehydrated, and water may attract them as much as food.


Leave a bowl of water for the rabbit. You will have the best chance of spotting a rabbit in the early morning or at dusk.This is when rabbits look for food or drink.
In the day time, a rabbit is usually hiding and will be harder to catch.Rabbits often hide out in bushes and trees or under decks. Some think rabbits will also eat cheesy biscuits and bread or be drawn by red fox urine.

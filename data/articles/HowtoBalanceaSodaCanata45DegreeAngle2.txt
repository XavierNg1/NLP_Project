 A salt shaker similar to a standard one you would find at most restaurants will work. Make sure the shaker has some salt to spare, as this trick doesn’t work without salt available.


Salt shakers without a beveled edge may have a more difficult time performing this trick, as it is harder for the salt to wedge itself under the shaker and prop it aloft. Top heavy salt shakers may also present a problem.
 Not much salt is needed for balancing the shaker. Shake just a small amount, roughly the size of a quarter, onto the table. Don't pour too much - you don't want to make a mess, and only a small amount is necessary.
 Press the shaker all the way into the salt, and occasionally let go to see if the shaker has balanced itself. Don’t get discouraged if it doesn’t work at first – this part is largely trial and error. There is no trick!


This can work with sugar crystals as well. However, it is a more difficult to achieve balance, as sugar granules are more fine, despite having a similar shape., Once the shaker is stable and in place, blow the remaining salt away. This will remove any trace of salt, except for the few granules that are holding the shaker in place. It will appear the salt shaker is standing askew on its own. Confound your friends with the power of science!


This can work with a pepper shaker as well, though it cannot balance on pepper!
Salt granules have a square shape, meaning they have flat sides that can easily prop the salt shaker into place.

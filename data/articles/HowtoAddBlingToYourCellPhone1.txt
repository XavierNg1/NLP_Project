 You can use a clear one or a colored one. You will be gluing the rhinestones to this case, then slipping it over your phone. Do not glue the rhinestones directly to your phone.
 You can use rhinestones that are all the same size and color, or you can experiment with different sizes and/or colors. You can even do a simply design, like an initial or heart.

If you are using all the same size, arrange them in staggered rows, like bricks on a wall.
If you are using a variety of sizes, start with the largest ones first, then fill in the gaps with the smaller ones.
 Choose a strong adhesive, such as super glue, E6000, Liquid Nails, Gem Tac, etc. If the glue came with a precision tip, leave it as it is. If the glue came in a bottle or tube, squeeze out a coin-sized dollop onto a disposable plate.

You should do this even if the rhinestones are self-adhesive. The glue on these types of rhinestones is not very strong, and they will fall off if you don't glue them down.
 Use a pair of jewelry tweezers to pick up your first rhinestone. If your glue bottle came with a precision tip, apply a bead of glue to the back of the rhinestone. If you poured the glue out, then dip the back of the rhinestone into the glue., If you need to, use the tips of your tweezers to nudge the rhinestone back into place. Once you are happy with the placement, gently press down on the top of the rhinestones with the tweezers., Do not cover any holes for plugs, cameras, buttons, or speakers; work your way around them instead. You can cover just the back of your phone case, or you can cover the back and sides.

If you are covering the sides, make sure that the rhinestones fit. If they are too big, they'll hang off of the edges and snag onto everything.
 Just because the glue feels dry to the touch does not mean that your case is ready to use. Some types of glues also have a curing time. This can be anywhere between 24 and 72 hours. Check the label on your bottle of glue for more specific drying times.

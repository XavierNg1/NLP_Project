 Struggling with a horse, hose, and shampoo is not fun, but it makes it so much easier. You should let the horse dry before you begin to braid. Their mane becomes very frizzy if you start when their mane is wet.;
, The mane should be about 4 inches (10.2Â cm) in length.
 Having someone with you may be beneficial because there is a lot for your hands to do when braiding, without having to hold your horse. An extra set of hands never hurts.
 This could save you from having to reach up so much, reducing the risk of hurting your arms.
 You will need around 40 pieces.

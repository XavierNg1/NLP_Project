 The most common example is someone using a spare room in their home or apartment as their business office.You can’t claim your kitchen table or your living room sofa, since you do other things in that space.
 Your home office is your “principal” place of business when you regularly and substantially perform business there.This doesn't mean you only work at home. For example, a lawyer can meet with clients at the home office but also go to court.


However, the home office can't be merely helpful. If you go to work every day, you shouldn’t claim a spare bedroom as a home office because you occasionally do a weekend of work in there. In this situation, using the spare room is merely helpful and appropriate, which isn’t enough to claim the deduction.
 The IRS gives you two ways. Choose whichever method is easiest for you to calculate:Simplified option. You measure the square footage of your office and then multiply the footage by a prescribe rate set by the IRS.
Regular method. You deduct the actual expenses, which include utilities, repairs, insurance, mortgage interest, and depreciation. Calculate by determining the percentage of your home dedicated to business use.

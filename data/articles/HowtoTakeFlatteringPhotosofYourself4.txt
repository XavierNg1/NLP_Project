 If there is a part of your face or body that you particularly want to emphasize, use a photo editing application to zoom in on it, then save the edit. Most smart phones and computers have photo editing software available, most of which is very user-friendly.
 Any parts of the photograph that are not flattering can be cropped out. If you took the photo with one arm, it’s usually best to crop the arm out of the picture, as it will look enlarged. If you think your hair looks crazy, crop it out. No one has to see the photos as you take them: don’t be afraid to edit before you share.
 Many photo-sharing websites have built-in filtering options.These will alter the appearance of your photo, bring out different colors and changing brightness and contrast. Experiment with different filters until you find one that makes your photo look the best.
 In addition to general photo editing software and applications, there are also applications that are made specifically for touching-up portraits.With these editing software programs, you can remove blemishes, eliminate red eye, and perform other touch-ups to even your skin tone and perfect your photo.
 While most people hope that their photos are ‘not’ blurry, sometimes a little selective blurring can improve your photo. By leaving part of the picture in focus and blurring other parts, you can direct the viewer to focus on what you’d like to emphasize and you can reduce the emphasis on other things, like awkward backgrounds or unflattering traits.

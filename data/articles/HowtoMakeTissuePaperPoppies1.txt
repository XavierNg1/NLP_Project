 Use additional layers of tissue paper if you want a fuller poppy. If desired, use more than one color to create variety and depth.;
, Trace around the lid with a pencil, then use scissors to cut out the circle.
 Use a small cup or another object about 2 inches (5.1Â cm) in diameter as a pattern. Draw around the circle, then cut out the black tissue paper.
 Poke a green pipe cleaner up through the middle of the stack. Leave about an inch of pipe cleaner extending above the paper. Bend the pipe cleaner down in a hook shape, then pull the bent part of the pipe cleaner through the paper so the hook is hidden in the poppy. Secure the pipe cleaner to the paper poppy with a small amount of white craft glue.
 Place the poppy in a vase or other decorative container. Repeat the steps for each tissue paper flower you wish to make.

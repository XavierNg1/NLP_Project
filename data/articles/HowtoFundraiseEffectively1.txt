 Get to know what you are fundraising or selling. If it is a cause, have experience in its advocacy so that you can better tailor your pitch. If it is a product, use it to gather personal insight to its inner workings.;
, Before you can fundraise for it, you must be 100% behind your product or cause. People are more likely to trust someone who is genuine about what s/he is selling.Being confident requires extensive knowledge about what you are trying to fundraise for.
Being confident requires some familiarity with public speaking and/or working with potential donors/clients.
 Before you try a bigger market, try talking with a smaller team first. You can meet with other members of the community you are involved with to talk about the key points in your fundraising plans.


You can brainstorm ideas for speeches.
You can talk about ways you may be able to fundraise (raffle, bake sale, auction, etc.)
You can discuss potential weak points in your product or cause.
You can practice public speaking skills or writing skills (such as brochures or other promotional material).
 Before entering the public eye with your fundraising, research what competitors are doing and how they have approached fundraising.


For example, if you are an agricultural non-profit on a specific type of produce, you may consider reading a website of another agricultural non-profit. This will help you get ideas from a similar market, but help to minimize plagiarism or fundraising to an oversaturated market.

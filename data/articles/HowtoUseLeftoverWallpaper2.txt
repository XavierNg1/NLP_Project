 Choose a mat that works well with the wallpaper. Coat the back of the mat with glue, then set it down onto the front of the wallpaper. Let the glue dry, then cut the mat out, following the outside edges.Use a craft blade for a clean, crisp edge.


Mats with thicker borders work best.
Make several framed pieces in different shapes and sizes. Hang them in a cluster on the wall.
 Cut a strip of wallpaper into a skinny rectangle. Get two wooden dowels, at least 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wider than the narrow ends of your wallpaper strip. Cover the top and bottom narrow edges of the wallpaper with double-sided tape, then wrap them around each dowel. Make sure that the wallpaper is centered on each dowel. Cut a length of string or ribbon, and tie each end to both ends of the top dowel. Hang it from a hook or nail on the wall.Wallpaper with Asian-inspired designs works best for this. Other motifs that work well include birds, flowers, branches, and plants.
 Get enough scraps of wallpaper to cover your desired surface. Attach the largest pieces to the surface first with the edges touching. Add the smaller pieces on top, overlapping them in a scattered, patchwork design. Keep doing this until the wall is covered and you are happy with your design.You will need at least three different colors, designs, or patterns.
Play around with solid colors and patterns. There is no wrong way to do this!
Follow the manufacturer's instructions if you are covering a wall. Use spray adhesive if you are covering furniture.

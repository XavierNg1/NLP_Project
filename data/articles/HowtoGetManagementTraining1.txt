 Many companies still like to train and hire from within, so that their employees are prepared to manage specifically within the company's rules and culture. Look for "management training" or "management track" in the job descriptions.


These jobs often require a serious commitment of 1 to 5 years in order to work up into mid-level manager status. Make sure you are prepared to commit the time, if the company wants to commit the resources to train you. It is unlikely that you will get exceptional references if you leave the job before your commitment is fulfilled.;
, Many companies are aware that many employee issues stem from management problems. Suggest a time management, team management, project management or other course that would improve your performance and your skill set.


When proposing a management course to upper management, it is a good idea to pick a program that is local and not too expensive. Although good training may not be cheap, it should be a good value for the skills learned. Research local training programs and propose the best option or options to your superiors.
 Speak to upper management about hiring an outside trainer to instruct your mid or upper-level management. It is a good idea to specify the type of management training, so that the company can target its areas of improvement.


Some companies and management training programs are structured as whole-day events, while others are set up in small blocks. If there is a lot of training to be done in your company, consider choosing small blocks of training, so that managers have time to absorb the material and put it into practice.

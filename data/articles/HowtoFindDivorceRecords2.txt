 You’ll need the names of the people who divorced, the state and county where they were divorced, and the date of the divorce., Visit the Vital Statistics office for the county where the divorce took place. If you don’t know the county, you can contact the state’s Vital Records Office. Reach out to them online, over the phone, or in person.These offices sometimes go by different names. For example, they might be called "Vital Records Offices" or "Public Health Offices" instead. Look in your phone book or check the county government’s website.
 The paperwork is often online. If not, stop into the office and complete the request form there. You generally need to pay a fee, but it is usually less than $20.Before submitting, check the form to see that you have included all requested information.
Mail the form and payment to the address provided. Depending on the state, you might need to include a self-addressed stamped envelope.
 Be prepared to wait anywhere from two weeks to six months before you receive a call that the paperwork is available for pick up. The paperwork might also be mailed to you.


Though relatively easy, this approach takes longer than finding records online. This method is probably ideal only if the records are fairly old.
Many states don’t allow third parties access to the divorce decree, unless you are a close relative.

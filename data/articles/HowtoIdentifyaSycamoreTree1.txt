 The bark of a sycamore tree is brittle and can’t withstand the rapid growth that sycamores experience. So the bark peels off frequently, and this results in a patchy, flaky appearance., Because the older bark peels off and reveals younger bark beneath, the bark of sycamores will be a variety of colors – brown, green, tan, and white. This gives the tree a distinctive pattern that resembles army camouflage., The crown, or canopy, of a sycamore tree can grow to over 60 feet (18 meters) wide and 80 feet (24 meters) tall. The branches and leaves fill out this space so that it creates a wide dome., While not the tallest tree, the sycamore grows to a larger diameter than any other tree in the eastern United States, so look for a trunk diameter of 3-8 feet (1-2.5 meters)., The twigs that grow off the branches will go in one direction, and then switch directions just after a bud pops out. This creates a zig-zig shape that looks a little like a lightening bolt.

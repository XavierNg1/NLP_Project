, It may sound counter-intuitive to boost your stinkiness if you’re looking to attract a mate, but pheromones are supposedly let out through sweat - mainly from your armpits. Try going all natural by staying away from deodorant, or at least using all-natural, non-scented antiperspirant without the added deodorant. Let your natural scent shine through for a boost in pheromones., Stay hygienic by taking showers or baths with hot water, but avoid harsh soaps. Feel free to add some sandalwood essential oil to your shower routine, instead. Staying clean is good, but don’t scrub away all your natural body odor.If you don't smell, don't worry. Pheromones themselves don't have a noticeable scent.

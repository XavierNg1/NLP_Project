 The basic rule is to put your jewelry on first and take it off last. This means finishing off your makeup before wearing the jewelry. This will keep your jewelry safe from any damage that hair spray or makeup products could cause. Similarly, when removing makeup, make sure you have already removed the sapphire jewelry. This practice will help reduce the amount of cleaning the jewelry requires.;
, Although sapphire is a very hard stone, it might be scratched, chipped or shattered by being knocked or scraped during manual activities. The stone may also become loose and fall out if knocked. Remove the jewelry while doing cleaning, washing, gardening, dusting, chopping, lifting load etc.
 Cleaning, household and yard/pool chemicals can damage or discolor the setting, react with metal or coat the stone. Never swim or bathe with your jewelry––remove when washing clothes or utensils, cooking or anyway working with chemicals.
 Whether you wear your sapphire jewelry regularly or occasionally, it needs proper cleaning to keep it shining and in good condition.
 Sapphires are very handy gemstones and you can clean them at home without requiring any special equipment. With just a bit of care, you can wash the pieces at home.
 You'll need some lukewarm water and mild detergent. You'll also need a soft brush (a soft toothbrush or an eyeliner brush would work well), a clean piece of jewelry cloth or any soft cloth.
 Add few drops of mild detergent to the bowl of lukewarm water.
 Let it soak for few minutes. Depending on how dirty the stones are, the soaking time may vary from 5 to 15 minutes.
 Gently scrub it to remove any residues.
 Rinse thoroughly under normal water.
, Once you have cleaned the sapphires, take a piece of jewelry cloth or muslin cloth and wrap the jewelry in it.
 Sapphires are hard but other sapphires, rubies, or diamonds can scratch them. And they might scratch other soft stones.
 Heat may alter the metal setting or could cause cracks into the stone.

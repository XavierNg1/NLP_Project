 Your mornings should be about getting dressed, eating and out the door. So what ever can be done the night before to make your morning smoother, is worth the effort.
 Iron it if possible. Get kids to lay out their clothes the night before as well, it is a great way to encourage independence., Again, you save time and headaches by not having to prepare it in the morning., Unless you prefer having a shower in the morning, have it in the evening instead. That is a personal preference but it can save time; in hot and sweaty weather, it also means that you go to bed clean., Baking muffins and freezing them are a great way to enjoy favorites anytime., For example, shoveling the snow from your driveway or off your car can take time, so make sure you have time to do these things. If the snowfall is heavy, try shovelling that day's snow before you go to bed, so that in the morning, you will have less to shovel., Going to bed late just makes it harder to wake up. Early to bed early to rise. Giving yourself time to really enjoy the morning makes them a lot more pleasant.

 Typical items of clothing that work well for potato printing include caps, socks, tights, t-shirts and canvas shoes. You can probably find other clothes to work with too.;
, If the clothing item is a sock, sleeve or leg, it'll need to be protected from the paint printing through to the unprinted side. To do this:


Draw and cut out a cardboard template the same shape as the item you're seeking to protect.
Slip the template inside the sock, sleeve or leg to provide a suitable barrier.

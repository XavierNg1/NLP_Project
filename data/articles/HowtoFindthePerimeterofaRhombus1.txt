 Since, by definition, all four sides of a rhombus are the same length, the formula is P=4S{\displaystyle P=4S}, where P{\displaystyle P} equals the perimeter, and S{\displaystyle S} equals the length of one side.You could also use the formula P=S+S+S+S{\displaystyle P=S+S+S+S} to find the perimeter, since the perimeter of any polygon is the sum of all its sides.If you know that not all sides are the same length, then you are not working with a rhombus, and you cannot use this formula.

If you donâ€™t know the length of any side of the rhombus, you cannot use this method.

A square is a special type of rhombus, with four 90-degree angles.
;
, Make sure you are substituting for the variable S{\displaystyle S}.

For example, if you know one side of the rhombus is 4 meters long, your formula will look like this: P=4(4){\displaystyle P=4(4)}.
 To do this, multiply S{\displaystyle S} by 4.

For example:P=4(4){\displaystyle P=4(4)}P=16{\displaystyle P=16} So, the perimeter of the rhombus is 16m{\displaystyle 16m}.

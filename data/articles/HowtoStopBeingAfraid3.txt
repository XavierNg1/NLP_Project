 If fear is a part of your daily life, and especially if it lowers your quality of life or never leaves your mind, you may be experiencing anxiety, or a psychological phobia.A therapist will be able to help you by providing objective insight into what may be causing your fear, helping you understand common causes of fear or anxiety, and outlining practical treatments (this will sometimes include medication).
If you’re not ready to talk with a mental-health professional, at least share your fears with a trusted person in your life.
 You might benefit from preparing yourself beforehand when you’re entering a situation that may cause you fear. If you prepare yourself mentally for an anxiety- or fear-inducing situation, the situation will not take you by surprise.For example, if you’re frightened by public places, then you might prepare by imagining yourself walking into a public place. Plan out how you will act and feel ahead of time. Some things you might consider include:
Will you speak to people?
How will you make your way through the crowd?
What people and things might you see?

, Taking good care of yourself on a daily basis may also help to improve your mental health, which may reduce the chances that you will feel anxious or fearful as you go about your day.Some things you can do to feel your best include:


Getting at least 8 hours of sleep every night.
Eating healthily.
Avoiding consuming too much caffeine.
Exercising regularly.
Making time for relaxation every day, such as doing 15 minutes of yoga or meditation every morning.

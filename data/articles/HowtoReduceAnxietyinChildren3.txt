 Children learn behaviours from watching their parents. So when you are thinking about your childâ€™s psychological well being you should also think about your own. For example, if you avoid stressful situations so will your child, and if you face your fears head on so will your child. Make sure that you are a positive role model when it comes to dealing with anxiety.You may need to talk with your child about things that cause you anxiety and how you approach them. Providing concrete and real life examples will help them understand the situation.
 Children will often look to their parents for simple cues on how to react to certain situations. For example, if your child falls they make look to see if you are concerned and react accordingly. If your child is struggling with anxiety issues then you need to work on managing your own anxiety.You may need to take a few slow breaths, slow down your speech, and ensure that your body is not tense when communicating with your child during a stressful situation.
 Children who suffer from anxiety often focus mainly on negative thoughts and self-criticism. For example, they may focus on the potential problems that could arise in future situations. Instead, help them focus more specifically on their positive attributes and the good aspects of the situation.If your child is afraid to go to a birthday party because they don't want to leave you focus on the fact that they will get to spend time with their friends, play games, and probably eat cake!

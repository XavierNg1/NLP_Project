 Simple syrup is made by dissolving sugar in equal amounts of water. It’s ideal for cold recipes because the sugar stays liquid after it dissolves. To make it, combine the sugar and 1 cup (237 ml) of the water in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat and bring the mixture to a low simmer.Once the sugar is fully dissolved, remove the pan from the heat and set it aside to cool.






Simple syrup will keep in the fridge for several weeks. To make extra for later, add double the water and sugar and divide when cool.
 While the simple syrup is cooling, squeeze the juice from between five and eight lemons, until you have a full cup (237 ml) of juice.You can either peel the lemons and run them through a juicer, or cut them in half and use a manual juicer to push out the juice.


You can also substitute in lime juice for any or all of the lemon juice if you want to make limeade or lemon-limeade instead.






You can use bottled lemon juice if you don’t want to go through the trouble of squeezing your own, but the results won’t be quite the same because bottled lemon juice doesn’t taste the same as fresh lemon juice.
 In a large pitcher or juice jug, stir together the syrup, the lemon juice, and the last 4 cups (948 ml) of water. Once fully combined, the lemonade is ready. You can also garnish it with:Sprigs of fresh herbs and flowers, such as thyme, basil, rosemary, and lavender






Fresh lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit slices






Pineapple wedges







, Transfer the pitcher of lemonade to the fridge and let it chill for about half an hour.To serve, fill a highball glass with ice and pour the lemonade over the ice. Refrigerate any leftovers for up to a few days.


To turn the lemonade into a lemon soda, mix equal parts lemonade and sparkling water and serve with an extra shot of lemon juice.

 After you have conducted your initial search and you are ready to proceed to the next stage, you really should consider hiring a patent attorney. The online search tools are good, but to make the final steps toward filing a patent application, a qualified attorney is invaluable.A patent attorney can help you identify other patents and avoid potential conflicts. An attorney can also help you tailor your own application so that you have a better chance of obtaining the patent that you want.
The USPTO website contains a resource to search for patent attorneys around the United States.
 A patent researcher is a kind of private investigator to help you with your patent search. Patent researchers often work as the staff of law firms, but you can also find individuals who provide the same service on their own (probably cheaper)., In the United States, you can find regional Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries (PTDL). These libraries are staffed with knowledgeable reference librarians who can help you conduct your search for patent information.


You can find a listing of PTDLs on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website at www.uspto.gov/go/ptdl.

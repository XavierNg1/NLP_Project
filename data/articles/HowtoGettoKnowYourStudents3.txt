 If your students participate in extra-curricular activities within the school, make a point of attending games or events from time to time. Making the effort to show support on your own time will show students that you care, and let you observe them in an environment outside of the classroom. It may also provide the opportunity to interact with your studentsâ€™ families in a casual, friendly atmosphere and learn more about them.To really get to know your students, consider signing up to coach a sports team or organize an after-school activity at school (e.g. the debate club).
 Give students the opportunity to reach out to you outside of the classroom by holding office hours during the week. Tell students that they are free to drop by during this time to discuss classwork or personal issues they might wish to talk about. Write your office hours somewhere for reference (e.g. on the chalk board of your classroom).Provide a way for your more introverted students to reach you by giving students your email address.
 To keep communication open with your students outside of class time, set up a website or other online component for your students. For example, set up a free wikispace classroom where you can add lesson plans, track student progress, have students write collaboratively, or engage in online discussions. This kind of web presence is a good way to monitor student activity and to get to know their work habits.

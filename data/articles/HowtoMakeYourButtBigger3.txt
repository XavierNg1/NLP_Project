 You can try shapewear that lifts instantly without major padding, or get padded inserts designed to enhance your butt when you wear jeans and pants. These work quite effectively and make your butt bigger immediately. Choose the size that works best with your clothing and the look you want to achieve.


Some jeans are actually sold with butt enhancers sewn in. Look for jeans or leggings that have a little extra padding.
Try making your own padding by using the foam filler or the batting material used to fill pillows and quilts.
 Butt fillers, injections, and implants have gained popularity in recent years, but the results are very mixed. In some cases these procedures have led to very uneven looking butt cheeks, with the filler material sliding and moving over time. Worst case scenario, the enhancement procedures lead to severe medical difficulties.Some people have died as a result of receiving toxic injections or implants that were done improperly. It's important to know the potential consequences before you take steps toward getting an enhancement procedure.

 If you're swimming, it's hard to beat pretending to be a big majestic whale. They're spectacular animals:


Swim deep under the water and stay under for as long as you can, then surface.
Blow water out of your spout.
Make "moo" sounds in the back of your throat while you're under water.
Move very slowly.
Eat green vegetables, and shrimp when it's time for a snack. Whales eat kelp and krill.
 Dolphins are smart and silly animals, that are a whole lot of fun. They're fast swimmers and friendly creatures:


Pop your head out of the water and say, "Ah-ah-ah-ah" like you're laughing.
Bop things with your nose.
Always be smiling and playing.
Blow water out of your spout.
Jump out of the water and do tricks.
Eat fish for a snack.
 Otters are mammals that live on land, but they're one of the best swimmers in the water, too:


Swim very fast with your head poking out of the water. Otters are sleek and quick.
Swim on your back, or float there while you eat a snack.
Get up and run out onto the land.
Float on your back and lock arms with another otter to take a nap.
 Sharks don't have to be scary. They're thoughtful swimmers and great hunters. If you want to be a shark:


Stick your hand on top of your head, and stick it out of the water while you swim, like a fin.
Find a weak creature like a younger sibling or pool toys to target.
Stalk it from far away, moving around it in slow circles that get closer and closer.
Swim very fast toward it when you strike with your big teeth.
Eat some meat or fish. Sharks can smell blood a mile away.
Never stop moving. Sharks must move to get oxygen through their gills. They have to move to stay alive.

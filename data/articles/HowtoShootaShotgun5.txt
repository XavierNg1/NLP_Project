 The powder and the grease from the gun can build up, causing malfunctions in no time. A dirty shotgun is a dangerous shotgun. Clean it.
 Follow the instructions in your owner's manual to break the gun down. If you've got a break action shotgun, you just need to let the gun hinge open and you can clean the gun that way. For a pump action gun, you'll at least need to remove the barrel to clean it.
 Use an aerosol degreaser or solvent designed for guns.Don't use this on any areas with moving parts, like the trigger assembly, but spray a coating of this into the barrel and into the choke tubes.
 Using a rag and a rod to push it through is fine, or you can purchase a Boresnake barrel cleaning device made for the purpose. Make sure the rag or the snake don't snag on anything and leave little cloth chunks in the barrel.
 These will get very dirty, taking the brunt of most of the powder grime that builds up on the gun. Use a rifle brush or an old toothbrush with a little bit of aerosol cleaner sprayed directly onto it.
 With a clean cloth, spot check for any powder or dirt spots that need scrubbing, and wipe the gun down of any excess aerosol spray.

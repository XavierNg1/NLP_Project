 As soon as possible, aim to reduce the potential for severe itching by treating the bite areas. Clean the bite area with rubbing alcohol, alcohol wipes, or plain water.For those who have a severe reaction to the bites and look as if they've caught chicken pox, apply an antihistamine cream or lotion.Especially effective are ointments containing a combination of an antihistamine, analgesic, and corticosteroid, as this can relieve both pain and itching.Washing with an antiseptic will often relieve initial pain from an insect bite.If signs of an infection develops from the bites or from scratching them, see your physician promptly.;
, The itch itself is caused by proteins in the mosquito's saliva, creating itchiness around the bite area from a mild allergic reaction.For people who are more sensitive to mosquito bites, the healing time can take longer than for those less susceptible, so it's merely a case of knowing your limits and treating yourself regularly and effectively.
 The choice you make should be guided by what you have available, the cost involved, any allergies to ingredients, ease of use, and familiarity with the solution. You may find that some solutions work better for you than others. All of them have been discovered by many other mosquito itch sufferers over time, and it's a case of working out which ones you like the most through trial and error. Naturally, always speak to your doctor for advice should you have any concerns, if you appear to have had a severe allergic reaction or if your bites are not healing.

 Shaker cards are slightly more difficult to make than other cards because you’ll have to invest in a die cutting machine.You could also try to cut the shapes out manually but it is much more difficult to make them all exactly the same shape and size.


Other materials include card stock, a paper cutter, a glue pen, craft glue, acetate, and filler material such as beads and sequins. All of these items can be purchased at a craft store.
 Your shapes should have an empty space on the inside. For example, if you draw a circle, make the center hollow. Use your die cutting machine to cut the border shapes from the cardstock. Make sure they are all exactly the same size – you’ll be placing some of the shapes on top of each other., For example, if you made circles you should put glue on the backside of one circle and then glue another circle to it. Continue to glue pairs of circles together until you have paired all your shapes.
 The front of your card can be as large or small as you’d like, but a standard size is 3.75” width x 5” height.Remember to cut a hole in the card that fits your border shapes – the window should have the same diameter as your border shapes. Place glue around the edges of this window.
 The glue will hold down the clear acetate but you should make sure you cut it in the same shape as your border shapes too. The border shapes will sit on top of the acetate while your beads and other accessories will be glued directly on top of it.
 Use the craft glue to glue your border shapes over the acetate. They should cover up the edges of the clear acetate but leave the middle of the shape see through., The window is the opening in your border shapes. Use your craft glue to add your beads and sequins to the acetate as you see fit. It will look like they are floating in thin air. Once you’ve finished the design aspect of the card you can begin to write a greeting.

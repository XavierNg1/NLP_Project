 You need to actually supervise all of the interactions between the new dog and the senior dog. Structure the time they spend in the same space and keep a watchful eye on their interactions.


If the senior dog growls at the new dog, you should not intervene. Growling is an important form of communication in the dog world, so your senior dog is simply teaching the new dog a valuable lesson.
If you hear loud yelps from the new dog or they start to fight, you may need to intervene, separate the dogs, and keep them apart for a few hours., Every day, you should schedule quiet time for both your senior dog and your new dog. Give them a toy to play with in their area of the house, in the backyard, cage or wherever they can spend time alone. Social time can be exhausting, especially for your senior dog., Make sure you allow a way for your senior dog to get out of the space where they are interacting with the new dog. They may get exhausted and need to leave the room or retreat to their cage.Avoid locking doors when they are playing together in the same room.
Leave your older dog’s cage open with a toy inside.
If the puppy follows the older dog when they retreat, you can stop them and put them in another room.
 Use a clicker, which is a noise making toy, to train your dogs. When either dog acts appropriately, use the clicker to signal appreciation for the good behavior. For example, if your older dog interacts well with the new dog and abstains from growling, you can use the clicker and then give attention or a treat as a reward.


If your new dog is a puppy and acts appropriately or abstains from jumping on your senior dog’s head while they are napping, you can use the clicker and then a treat to reward them.
You can buy clickers at your local pet store.

There is no emotion, there is peace.
There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.
There is no passion, there is serenity.
There is no chaos, there is harmony
There is no death, there is the Force.;
, The Jedi seem very arrogant on the surface, but this is because they notice things which others don't, and they learn to keep their mouths shut. Train your senses to perceive things which most people overlook, then learn to hint at them without actually telling people.
 The Jedi are deeply spiritual, they feel and move in the Force. Recognizing that there is a higher order is key to seeming Jedi.
 A big part of the Jedi mindset is to protect those who cannot protect themselves. They fight for justice and peace. If you see someone in danger, make your best attempt to help them out.
 Life, in every form, is considered sacred by the Jedi. Don't crush the spider, let it go.
 The strongest Jedi seek to maintain an anchor to the visual world. Some become great star ship pilots, others learn the ways of machines and how to operate them.
 Many Jedi serve as generals. Play chess, shogi, go, and other games which require strategy and forethought.
 Don't order extravagant or large meals, or wear fancy clothes. Try to blend yourself with your surroundings while keeping a dignified air.

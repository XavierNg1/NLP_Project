 "RP" servers include: Moonguard, Wyrmwrest Accord, Cenarion Circle. "RP" servers are made especially for WoW (World of Warcraft) players who enjoy RolePlaying.;
, First, choose what faction you want your character to roleplay on. Then, choose the characters race and class. Finally, create a name for your character. It would not be a good idea to name your character names such as "Shammypwnz" or "Twinklelight", instead you should give your character a more realistic name like "Chloe" or "Sebastian".
 Some examples of a characters back-story could be "XXXXX used to live on a farm with his/her parents. One year later, his/her family got wiped out by the Scourge." or maybe "XXXXX used to be a commander of the Horde, then lost his/her position because he/she disobeyed an order from the Warchief."

, Your character can't just be dull. Try giving your character personalities. Is your character caring? Is he/she cruel? Personalities will make your character seem more interesting.
 Some roles include: Soldier, Archer, Cook, Commander, Engineer, Trader, archmage. You should also have a reason for how your character earned this role.
 It would be quite boring to roleplay all by yourself. Other players are going to think you are strange. A great place to find a roleplaying buddy is an Inn/Tavern in a capital city (Stormwind, Orgrimmar, Ironforge, etc). Inns are a pretty popular RP spot, so you'll find a lot of friendly buddies to Roleplay with.
 Use more of a more "Advanced" vocabulary instead of a "Simple" vocabulary. Have good grammar also.
 Roleplay can get pretty boring if it's just a simple conversation between two people. Throw in some action! Examples include: "XXXX pushed his/her ale to the edge of the small wooden table." or "XXXX kicked XXXXXX in the ribs."

, Roleplaying is very fun, especially if you're bored in WoW.

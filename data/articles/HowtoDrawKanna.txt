 This will help you place the character on the page and keep her in proportion throughout the process.


Now make a circle with guidelines for the head. They should be about one-quarter the line's length--vertical for the nose and moth, horizontal for the eyes.;
,


Use a vertical rectangle for the torso and a horizontal rectangle for the lower body. Use straight lines for the hands/legs (with circles for joints), triangles for hands, and rectangles for feet

,


Make a dress with puffed long sleeves and a skirt showing under the dress. Kanna is an apparently innocent, childish character, so make sure her clothing matches that image.



Sketch the face and hair. Draw bangs straight across her forehead and long hair (follow the tutorial's illustration). Don't forget the buds on either side of her head for her flowers.
 Add details.


Give her toes, geta sandals (Japanese wooden sandals), a kimono-style collar on the dress, and the flowers in her hair. Most importantly, draw her magical mirror cradled in her hands.
 Color her in if you like.

 Single people more frequently have closer ties with friends, have more friends, and are better friends to others. This phenomenon occurs because single people have more time to spend with their friends.Take advantage of your single lifestyle to hang out with your friends, make new friends, and forge better relationships with friends both new and old.


Instead of going to parties with your significant other, you can go with your group of friends. You don’t have to worry about keeping track of your date or making awkward small talk.
Designate at least one night a week where you and your friends spend quality time with each other. Whether it’s a movie night or watching a sports game, make time to hang out with your friends.
 Sometimes it’s easy to forget about your parents and other family members when you’re away at college, but they will certainly appreciate it if you give them a call or even send a text. Try to call your parents at least once a week to update them on your life and your studies. Calling family is also a good way to combat the loneliness that a lot of people feel while they are away at college.


If you keep forgetting to call your parents, set a regular time when you call them. Set an alarm on your phone, or ask them to call you at that time.
 Professors have office hours where you can go talk to them about the material from the class, but many of them are also happy to talk to you about academics and life and general. You can only forge relationships with professors in college, so you should take advantage of this opportunity. Look at a schedule to see when your professors’ office hours are, or you can email them to ask to meet individually.

 If you are greeted with a busy dial tone, press the "End Call" button to hang up the phone. You can only redial the number after ending your current call.


Note that this method should work for nearly all cell phones, include both standard mobile phones and smart phones.
 Press the "Call" button on your phone or open the "Phone" app.If you do not have a smart phone, you will need to open your call log by pressing the green "Call" button on your phone's keypad. This button will usually be marked with a green telephone icon.
If you have a smart phone, you will need to open your call log by navigating to the "Phone" app and tapping it once.
 In most cases, you will automatically be shown a list of your most recent calls as soon as you open your call log. If your recent calls do not show up, you will need to navigate to that menu option.


Scroll through the list of menu options in your call log and select the one marked "Recent." Hit the "Enter" button on a standard mobile phone or tap on the "Recent" button if using a smart phone.
 The last call you dialed should be at the top of your list. If it isn't already selected, scroll through your calls until that number becomes highlighted.


If you received another call after dialing the number you are trying to reach, the call you received will appear above the one you dialed. Make sure that the number you select is the one you wish to redial before you continue.
 Hit the "Call" button again to redial the highlighted phone number.


If you are not using a smart phone, you will need to call the number by hitting the green "Call" button on your phone's keypad.
If you are using a smart phone, selecting the number will usually open a set of options. From those options, tap on the "Call" or “Dial” button.

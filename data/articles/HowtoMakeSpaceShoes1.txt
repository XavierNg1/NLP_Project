 Make sure the shoes are a solid color. Converse, Vans, and Keds work great for this project, but you can use any shoes you'd like.









White works well as it's a good canvas for any color, but black offers a natural space template to work off of, too. Colors show up less well on black, but you don't necessarily have to paint the entire shoe evenly to cover the material.;
, Print them out and use them as templates when you get down to business with your shoes. They'll give you ideas and make your shoes look a little more convincing, apart from just visually pleasing.
 If you don't have some already, you can find them fairly cheaply at craft stores. You'll probably want blue, purple, pink, white, and possibly some metallic colors (if you're staying authentic). However, all the colors of the rainbow exist in the universe, so go crazy with your imagination if that's more down your alley.









While you're at it, get a paint tray!

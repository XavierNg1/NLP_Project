, Sometimes just wearing bulky socks, or two layers of socks will solve the problem. In winter weather, a felt liner can fit inside snow or hiking boots, which adds warmth as well as a better fit.
 Add tissue/paper towels into the back of your shoe near your heel. This can easily make up for the size. You can not do this with sandals or shoes with no back.
 Sometimes adding a pair of supports (available in most shoe and drugstores) can make a better fit, and perhaps support your feet better.
 Walk around in your shoes with the tissues in them. Make sure they are still not loose. If they are still loose, add more tissue to your shoes.
 Although shoes that are slightly too big are better than wearing a pair that's slightly too small, it's still not good for your feet. If at all possible, get shoes that fit your feet.

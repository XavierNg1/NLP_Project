 Potbelly pigs are fairly clean pets, so many owners have no problem keeping them indoors. If you want to raise your potbelly pig indoors, however, it's important to set up the right environment so your pig can thrive.Pigs don't need to be confined frequently, but they should have their own space in the house. A dog or cat crate works well.
Make sure to fill the crate with blankets and bedding. If you have more than one pig, each pig should have its own bed.;
, If you prefer, and if you have a backyard, you can keep a potbelly pig outside. You should also have an outdoor shelter in place just to let your indoor pig out on occasion.Potbelly pigs are not very big and cannot jump high. They should have some kind of fenced in enclosure, but there's no need for the enclosure to be more than 4 feet high.
You should also have shelter and bedding inside the enclosure, especially if you plan to keep your pig outside longterm. There should be a small crate or shelter your pig can enter, filled with bedding and timothy hay.
If you live in an area where the heat ever drops below 50 °F (10 °C), it's necessary to have a heated shelter. You can also let your pigs indoors on night where the heat is expected to dip below 50 degrees.
 The staple of a healthy potbelly pig's diet is pellets. You can find pellets specifically designed for potbelly pigs online or at a local pet store. Feed your pig a serving of pellets twice a day. Refer to the label on your chosen pig food for instructions on how big a serving you need. How much food a pig needs depends on its precise size.
You should make sure you're not overfeeding your pet. An overweight pig is not healthy and will need to lose weight. If your pig starts gaining weight, talk to a vet about adjusting its diet.
 While pellets should be the staple of a pig's diet, they should not live on pellets alone. A pig should be allowed free time outside to graze on grass. You should also feed it a variety of fresh produce.Stick to low calorie vegetables like leafy greens, celery, carrots, and cucumbers. Avoid higher calorie veggies, like canned vegetables, corn, nuts, and seeds.
Fruit can be given to your pig on occasion as a treat, but it should not be a staple of your pig's diet. Stay away from dried fruit, as this is high in calories.

You can also use wood chips as long as they're not cedar.Most pigs will use the litter box on their own without much effort. If your pig defecates outside the box, place the feces in the litter box so the pig knows where to go.
Praise the pig for using the box. Pigs are highly intelligent and can understand praise. If you say something like, "Good pig!" after your pig uses its litter box, it will begin to understand.
 Pigs are social animals. They thrive on play, so make sure you play with your pig regularly. A pig that does not get enough attention will not be happy and may act out.You can use rubber dog toys for your pig. You can toss these toys for your pig and it will chase and catch them.

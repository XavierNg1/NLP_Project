 This dish doesn’t take too long to make, but it will go infinitely smoother if you have your ingredients measured out and ready to go before turning on your stove. Mince your garlic, chop your sage leaves, and cut the cream cheese into chunks, then put them into ramekins or other small cups until you’re ready to use them.Do this for any ingredient that requires prep work, so you can focus on the cooking, rather than the measuring.
If you want to look fancy, refer to your prepped ingredients and supplies as your mise en place. That’s the proper term for it in the culinary world!;
, This recipe works best with noodles like fettuccini, linguine, or spaghetti. Prepare your pasta according to their specific instructions. Make sure to prepare your pasta al dente, so that it is not too soft., Once your pasta has finished cooking, drain it. Make sure to save about one cup of the water used for cooking the pasta, because you may need it later to thin out the final dish. Then, set it aside with the rest of your ingredients as you create the sauce.

 It can be easy to lose yourself in a relationship, especially if your significant other has a strong personality. However, it is important to maintain your identity and avoid changing yourself for someone else.If you start to feel like you are allowing your significant other’s interests and views take over your own, try taking some extra time to yourself. Use the time to reflect on what you like to do and what you believe in.
 Make sure that you have at least one day every week to yourself. On your day to yourself, you can:


Indulge in a hobby.
Treat yourself to some shopping and spa treatments.
Read a book.
Work on a personal goal, such as training for a race or finding a job.
 Spending time with your friends and family is also important. If you devote all of your time to your new relationship, then your other relationships may suffer. Make sure that you set aside time to spend with your friends and family without your new boyfriend or girlfriend.Plan a girls or guys night out.
Go hiking at a local park with your family.
Meet up with some friends for coffee.
Help your mom or dad run errands around town.
 Relationships can also interfere with your daily routine, which is not good for you. Make sure that you are keeping up with all of your other obligations and not letting them fall off your radar due to the new relationship.Don’t skip work or school to be with your new guy or girl.
Keep up with your exercise routine and other hobbies.
Don’t cancel plans with friend or family to be with your new love interest.

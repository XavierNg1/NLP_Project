 Line a shallow, rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.


You could also spray the baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray instead of using the aluminum foil.
Do not use a baking sheet without sides.
 Use a serrated kitchen knife to cut the squash in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds, then cut each half into 3/4-inch (1.9-cm) slices.


Start with a clean acorn squash. If the squash had not yet been cleaned, scrub the skin with water and a vegetable brush until all visible dirt and debris has been removed.
Use a rubber cutting mat if you have difficulty holding the squash still as you cut it.
Dig out the seeds and stringy guts with a sturdy metal spoon or ice cream scoop.
 Arrange the slices of acorn squash in a single layer on your baking sheet. The pieces should be fairly spread out.


Do not overlap. For best results, you should prevent the pieces from touching, as well.
 Drizzle the olive oil over the squash pieces and toss to coat. Then, add the thyme, salt, and pepper. Toss again to coat evenly.


The salt and pepper can be done to taste, but if you feel uncertain about how much to use, try 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground black pepper.
 Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the slices.


The cheese should be as evenly distributed as possible.
 The squash should be golden brown and soft when finished.
 Let the squash cool for 2 or 3 minutes before serving the slices whole.


Note that the skin is thin enough and nutritious enough to eat when cooked, but whether or not you eat the skin is a matter of individual taste.

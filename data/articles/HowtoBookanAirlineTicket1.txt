 Depending on your trip, you may have some flexibility in terms of your exact location. Do some research to find the perfect destination for you.


For example, if you want to visit the Caribbean, there are over 28 island nations and 7000 individual islands to choose from.
If your destination is fixed, you may still be able to research secondary airports. For example, if you are visiting your relatives in San Francisco, you could also look at flying into the nearby Oakland Airport.;
, With your fellow travellers, decide when you are going on your trip and for how long. The more flexible you are with your dates, the easier it will be to find a deal.If your dates are not flexible or if your trip is coming up very soon, it’s best to book as soon as possible. This is especially important if you are flying during a popular period, like Thanksgiving., Some international destinations will require visitors to have special visas to come to their country or get vaccinations ahead of time. Include this in your research so you have time to make arrangements, apply for any visas and schedule travel vaccination appointments.

 If you’re traveling with an infant, depending on the flight carrier, you may not need to buy a separate seat for the child. However, traveling with a baby may also mean that you will need to pack extra things like a diaper bag, playpen or stroller.

 If you have a sensitive scalp, look into getting a no lye relaxer. These types of relaxers are known for being milder and are often used on sensitive scalp. These formulas work very quickly so it may be in your best interest to enlist the help of a friend or a professional when working with them.No-lye relaxers are best for people who want to relax their own hair at home.
No-lye relaxers can take longer to process than lye-based formulas, which can lead to hair damage since users sometimes leave them on too long.;
, Relaxers that contain natural plant extracts can help soothe the scalp. Some relaxers contain extracts such as chamomile, sage, and aloe, which could help to minimize the irritation to your hair and scalp. There are also relaxers that are designed to work on sensitive scalps., These types of relaxers should contain chemicals that are less severe, thus reducing the harsh effect that most relaxers can have on the scalp.
 The use of no-lye relaxers can dry out the hair due to the buildup of calcium, which is contained in the formula of most no-lye relaxers. Calcium deposits on the hair will eventually dry it out and make it look dull. This can be remedied by using a clarifying shampoo to remove the deposits. Most clarifying shampoos can be purchased at your local grocery store or beauty supply store.


Do not use clarifying shampoos more than once every month or two if you have dry hair and no more than every other week if you have hair that is more oily. This is because frequent use can begin to strip your hair of its natural oils, thus drying it out even more and making it more susceptible to damage.

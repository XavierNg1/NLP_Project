 Make sure the gyms you are looking into are close to your daily routine. It is surprising how much you will avoid the gym if you do not pass it everyday.;
, Get their recommendations. Do they hate their gym? Love it? Have a schedule similar to yours so you two can partner up in your workouts?

, Is one gym radically cheaper or more expensive then the others? How much are you willing to pay? Can your spouse join at a cheaper rate?

, Visit the gyms during the times that you are planning to work out. Is it really crowded? Does the muscle man group take over the gym at that time? How flexible is their schedule compared to yours? If you repeatedly get the notion to work out at 3am on Thursdays are they open? If it is crowded when you visit the machines you would want to use may be taken quickly. Are there lockers for you to temporarily store your clothes and other personal items?

, Inspect it; does it look old and abused? Do they have only 3 kinds of machines? Look for lots of different equipment, but several of each piece. The equipment should look good and taken care of.
 The staff will know right away you are not a member as soon as you walk in without a gym bag and not dressed for exercise. How friendly are they? Do they ignore you? Ask them about organized classes that they offer. Do they offer private training sessions with a certified personal trainer?

, If you do not like the gym after joining, can you get your money back? Some gyms have specific rules and time conditions on their refunds.
 If you think this is the gym for you, sign up! If not, keep looking. There are plenty out there. Beware of long contracts or other stringent policies that will keep you locked into membership after you want to leave.

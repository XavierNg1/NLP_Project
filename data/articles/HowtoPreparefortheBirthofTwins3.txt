 Include all the baby basics such as sleepwear, one piece undershirts, socks, hats and bibs. The more basics you have on hand, the less laundry you’ll be doing. Consider mix and match interchangeable outfits. Twins don’t always have to be dressed alike; their wardrobe will seem larger if you have a wide variety of items to choose from.
 Go to a popular department store, baby specialty store or online merchant and generate a registry. This will make it easy for family and friends to shop for your babies when they arrive.
 This is especially helpful if you are trying to stay within a budget. Nearly new baby gear is usually just as good as brand new items in the stores.
 One of the greatest challenges of having twins is getting out and about with them. There are many strollers on the market geared for twins, some more practical than others. Be sure to go to your local department store and try them out. Try pushing a few different double strollers around the store; you will quickly realize they are not all created equal. Decide which one best suits you and your traveling needs.
 Go to your local warehouse store and buy diapers and wipes in bulk. It is estimated that twins will go through 140 diapers a week. Buying in bulk will save you a great deal of money and lessen your time spend at the store.

 First, if you are going to a website or going to a game, and whatever, You can see that there is a pop-up box alerted that you have a lot of computer virus threats and you need to buy it and install this anti-virus software or spyware scanner but be aware that it's tricking ya! Get smart of all about computers and get to know about a Trojan horse. Disagree and close the pop-up box so it won't install it but another pop-up box appear to warn that your computer is infected with virus or spyware. Still, disagree it.;
, Get a real one, not a fake one because it's a virus because that it's Trojan horses. Get real ones like BitDefender, Avast!, AVG, or Windows Live One Care (only for windows). Do not get fake ones like Green Antivirus 2009, Spyware Sheriff, or Dollar Revenue. Your computer will get a virus. Don't get fake ones, Duh!

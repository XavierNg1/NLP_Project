 If your brother or sister is at the point in school where they are writing a lot of papers on their computer, you can prank them using their word processing system. Go to “Autocorrect” under the “Tools” tab and change the settings to automatically replace normal words like “that” or ‘the” with ridiculous ones like “blarganauv” and “snoodle-shanks”. Change as many words as you want! If you want to really get them in trouble you can change the words to something like “my teacher stinks” and hope that they don’t notice it.
 Do this after they go to bed or before they head to school in the morning. You don't want to give them a chance to notice it and change it back. Change their wallpaper to something embarrassing, like a picture of them sleeping in a funny way, or maybe pictures of puppies and hearts that you find on the Internet if they are a boy. You know your sibling, choose something that you think would embarrass them. When they open up their laptop at school people will see their new background.
 Right before they go to school, find their backpack, empty it, and fill it with their underwear. They will be so confused, and it will also inconvenience them throughout the day.
 Introduce yourself and say, “Oh, you must be ”. When they say no, act confused and tell them that your sibling is always talking about this other person. This will get your sibling in some hot water!

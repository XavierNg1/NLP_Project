 Drag a plain-text or rich text document onto your note, and it will copy itself into the note.


If you add a PDF file, the file will appear in its own sub-window with easy viewing controls.
You can't add MS Word files without paying for an upgrade.
 Highlight the text you want to add, then drag it into the note. Simple!


Adding web addresses this way will automatically format them as clickable hyperlinks.
 Drag an image file onto your note. It appears as a picture, scaled to fit inside the note window.


You can drag pictures around to rearrange them.
Animated pictures, such as .GIF images, will be animated.
 Most common music file formats (such as WMA and MP3) will appear inside a long box in your note.


You can play music files directly from Evernote by clicking the Play button on the left side of the box.
 Aside from the common files described above, Evernote will display files you add as large rectangular buttons. Try adding some files of various types, such as saved web pages and WMV video clip files, to see what the buttons look like.


If you click the button, the file will open, provided the program to open it is installed on the device. However, Evernote can't open the file on its own.
 It's useful to know how to get rid of files inside notes that you no longer want or need there. There are two basic ways to do this:


Right-click (or context-click) on an item such as a picture or button and choose “Cut” from the menu.

Items you cut can be pasted back in elsewhere, if you like. Place the cursor and type Control-v to paste.


Place the cursor just ahead of what you want to delete, and use the delete key to erase it.

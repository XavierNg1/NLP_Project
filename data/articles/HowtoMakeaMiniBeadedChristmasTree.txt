 Place a pin in each corner of one side of the small block. Paint the small Styrofoam block with the brown paint and be sure to paint the bottom of the block around the pins. Using the four pins as a stand, place the block somewhere to dry. This small block will be the base of our beaded Christmas tree.;
, Place four pins in the flat side of the Styrofoam cone. Paint the Styrofoam cone with the green paint and be sure to paint the bottom of the cone around the pins. Using the four pins as a stand, place the cone somewhere to dry. This Styrofoam cone will be the top of our beaded Christmas tree.
 Using the hot glue gun, squeeze some glue out onto the top of the base. Quickly place the flat side of the cone on the top of the base and hold the pieces together for one full minute. This will ensure a strong joint between the top and the base of the beaded Christmas tree.
 Separate the pins by color, whilst being careful not to drop any. Slide two to four of the clear beads onto each of the colored pins.
 Push the pins into the Styrofoam cone until the beads touch the Styrofoam. The clear beads gives the tree a 3-D effect, and varying the amount of beads per pin will allow you to give your beaded Christmas tree a "layered look".
 Your beaded Christmas tree is now complete and is ready to be enjoyed in time for the holidays!

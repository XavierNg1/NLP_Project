 Place your lightbox on your tabletop (or lap, depending on the style you have), and put your image over the top. Tape the corners of your image down, and layer your drawing paper on top of the image. Secure the drawing paper with tape as well, and turn the light on. Assuming your drawing paper isn’t too thick, you should be able to see the image through your drawing paper.
 Carefully work around your image, outlining all the major objects and figures with your pencil. Because you don’t have to remove or transfer any papers other than the one you’re drawing on, you can shade in figures in addition to the outlines, if you want.
 Turn off the light on the lightbox to determine if you’ve missed any spots on your drawing. If you have, turn the light back on, fill them in, and finish up your outline. When you’ve finished tracing the image, you are free to move on and add color or more shading and detail, with or without the use of the lightbox.

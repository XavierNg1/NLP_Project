 Google Street View allows you get up-close images of locations on the map. You can even move around in this view as if you were walking down the street! To use Street View, start by finding a location on the map you'd like to view (either with its address or name.)

, Once you find the place you're looking for, a panel of information on this location should pop up. Click the "Street View" button â€” it looks like a picture of the location itself.



Mobile: On Mobile, first, you must tap the tab at the bottom of the scree (not the driving directions button), then tap the Street View button.
 Once you're in Street View, you can look at your surroundings and even move around just like you were actually on the street. See below:



Browser: To look around, left-click and hold down as you move the mouse around. To zoom in and out, use the middle mouse button or the +/- buttons in the bottom right. To move around, double click on a spot you'd like to "walk" to and wait for the next screen to load.

Mobile: To look around, tap and hold down as you move your finger across the screen. To zoom out, make a pinching motion with two fingers. To zoom in, reverse this motion. To move around, double tap on a spot you'd like to "walk" to and wait for the next screen to load.

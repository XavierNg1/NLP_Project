 Not everyone likes the taste of baking soda, but some people swear it's safer and more effective than commercial toothpaste. Brush your teeth with a paste of baking soda and water, then rinse.
 You can make shampoo, body wash, or facial wash out of baking soda and water.
 Pour a little baking soda in your shoes to prevent sweating and stinky feet.

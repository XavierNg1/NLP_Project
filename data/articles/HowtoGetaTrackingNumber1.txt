 As soon as you buy something online, make sure you get an email confirmation and a receipt. These are essential for finding packages, dealing with disputes, and tracking your order. If you have not received an email within 24 hours, email the seller requesting confirmation of payment and shipment.


Check your spam and trash folders as well, as most confirmation messages are sent automatically the second you place your order.;
, Most sites will send you a tracking number as soon as they ship the package. If they do, you can use this number on the carrier's website (USPS, FedEx, etc.) to keep up to date with your order. Note, however, that you can not get a tracking number until the order is actually shipped. If there is a handling period or your order still needs to be made, you will not see a tracking number until it is shipped.
 Under "My Orders" on Amazon, for example, you can see a detailed breakdown of your order status, including if it has shipped, where it is now, and what the tracking number is.
 If you are sure your package is in the mail, but still don't have a tracking number, call or email the company you purchased the product from requesting. Be sure to have any customer ID or receipt numbers handy so that they representative can quickly bring up your order.


If you've lost a tracking number, the customer service team for the company you ordered from should have one on file.
 If you have a FedEx tracking number, go online to FedEx and type it in under "Track Package.' This will help you see your package's current location and when it should arrive.


If you lose a tracking number, and can't get in touch with the company, call your local post office. They may have records of the package if it is delivered by the USPS. Otherwise, call your local UPS, FedEx, or DHL branch and see if they can help you, though it is a long shot.

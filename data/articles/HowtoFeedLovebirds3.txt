 Newborn or baby lovebirds do well with being hand-fed, where you feed them by hand. This can be a time consuming process but it is ideal if you are raising a baby bird from infancy and want it to do well.Often, hand-fed lovebirds grow much stronger and happier than baby lovebirds that are fed from a bowl.
 Look for a small syringe with a small opening. You can find them at local pet stores or online. You will also need baby bird food, which often comes in a powder. You will need to mix the powder into boiling water to make the formula for feeding. Follow the instructions on the package for the ratio of water to powder.
 Hold the baby lovebird in one hand with your fingers wrapped lightly around its chest. Fill the syringe with the formula to 6-8ml. Put a small amount on your palm to make sure the formula is not too hot, just warm to the touch. Gently tilt the baby’s head upwards. Place the syringe into the baby’s beak and start feeding it.Let the baby bird consume the formula slowly and at its own speed. Do not try to force the baby to eat from the syringe.
 The crop is a upper section of the baby bird’s stomach that inflates as it eats. Once it is bulging, you can stop feeding the bird.

Feed the bird the formula every three to four hours. Always feed it until its crop is bulging, never any more than that.
 Use a clean towel to gently wipe off the lovebird’s beak once it is done eating. Most lovebirds will go to sleep after eating.

 Try to get a corsage that uses a flower he/she likes.
 The last thing either of you want is for your date to have an allergic reaction during the evening.
 Look for flowers that naturally blossom in those hues, or consider flowers that can be dyed, like carnations.
 Traditional corsages are tied around the wrist, but other popular options include pinned-on corsages and hand-held nosegays, a type of small bouquet. Find out if she has a preference amongst the three.

 Cover a flat surface with newspaper and then pour approximately two to three cups of paint onto a paper plate.









Place one sheet of heavy artist paper per workstation. Consider pre-creating the tree branches and trunk if you are working with small children.
 Remember that each branch will hold a cherry blossom print to take this into consideration when spacing out branches (and choosing the number of branches).









Allow for ample dry time before creating the cherry blossoms. Otherwise the black/brown paint may mix with the cherry blossom color and disturb the integrity of the design.
 You want to cover the bottom but donâ€™t over saturate.
 Aim for or near a branch and press down.

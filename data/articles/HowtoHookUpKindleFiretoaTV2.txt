 These cables have an HDMI plug on one end and a smaller HDMI plug on the other end, as opposed to traditional HDMI cables.

The 2017 line of Kindle Fire HD's does not support HDMI output.
If your TV doesn't support HDMI input, you'll also need to buy an HDMI-to-analog converter box and a set of RCA male-to-male cables.
 The large end of the cable should go into the TV, and the small end connects to your Kindle Fire HD's micro-HDMI port.

The micro-HDMI port is next to the charging port on the bottom of the Kindle Fire HD.
If you're using an HDMI-to-analog converter: plug the Kindle Fire HD into the converter using the HDMI cable, then plug the converter into the TV with the RCA cables.
 You should see your Kindle Fire HD's screen reflected on your TV's screen, though you may need to rotate your Kindle Fire HD in order for the display to appear right-side-up on your TV.

If necessary, you'll also need to change your TV's input to match the slot to which the Kindle Fire HD is attached (e.g., Video 3).

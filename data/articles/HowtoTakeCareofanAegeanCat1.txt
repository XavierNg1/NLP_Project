 An Aegean cat has a semi-long haired coat. This means that they will shed, especially during the spring and summer. To help with this, brush the cat once a week to remove dead hair.Make sure to use a wire slicker brush to brush your cat.
If your cat doesn’t like being brushed at first, try to work them up to it. Start by brushing them right before they eat, that way they associate brushing with something positive.;
, You should perform basic grooming tasks for your cat regularly. This includes trimming their nails and cleaning their ears. You may want to take your cat to the vet to get their nails trimmed if you cannot do it yourself.


To clean their ears, use a liquid ear cleaner and a cotton ball.
To trim the nails, get your cat comfortable and use the right tool. Make sure you clip only the nail and not the quick. Put the cat on your lap with your dominant arm gently around your cat’s upper body to keep it in place. Pick up a paw with your other hand and gently press on the paw to get the claws to come out. Use your dominant hand to trim the nails.
 You should also keep your cat’s teeth clean. Try brushing your cat’s teeth with a safe cat toothpaste and soft-bristled toothbrush. Let the cat taste the toothpaste by putting a little on your finger. Do this for a few days, and then when your cat gets used to that, start rubbing your finger along their gums.


When they are used to that, put toothpaste on the toothbrush and carefully rub it along the cat's gums. Over the next few days, work the bristles on the toothbrush along the teeth in tiny circles. Keep adding teeth until the cat will let you clean the entire mouth.
Never use human toothpaste on a cat.
You should also take your cat to the vet for regular checkups, and make sure your vet gives your cat an oral exam and dental cleaning.

 Be funny and witty as much as possible. Act tough and like you're popular. Pirates are always somewhat arrogant. Have fun boating. Fencing is also great. You can play cards and dice, but don't use real money, use "pieces of eight" (pirate currency). Practice lock picking if possible, although it is illegal to carry a lock pick kit in most states.
 Keep your head up high, but don't stick your nose in the air. Stomp a little, but go quickly. Keep in mind that pirates tended to remain inebriated for long periods of time, so you may want to wobble a bit, as well.
 On a ship, most of the time, a person couldn't get her point across with just words.
, Pirate girls come in all shapes and sizes. The important thing is that their bodies are their own, to do with as they please.
 Respect them deeply, but don't baby them like they're not self-sufficient.
 Sometimes coverup, mascara, eyeliner, and lip gloss are too much and make you look less piratey.

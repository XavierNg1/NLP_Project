 This hero can be a roamer at early game play by carrying a bottle. Try to block an enemy hero by using the 1st skill. Try to start at the bottom lane.;
, If you see the enemy hero stand at a position where you can block by using your first skill, like between a tree, then just go for it.
 This hero is better if he has a dagger with him. With this combination skill, that is use dagger at hero. If they regroup, that's even better. Then use multi + 1st skill + 2nd skill.

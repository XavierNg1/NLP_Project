 Due to the customized nature of Ubuntu Linux, there is no single image editor to choose from. Instead, you should choose whichever image editor you have on your computer or whichever you prefer to use.


You can usually find your image editor by navigating to Applications -> Accessories.
 Depending on your image editor, there may be a variety of ways to do this. The simplest way covers all possible applications, though. Hit Ctrl+v on your keyboard to paste the image into your editor's window.


Note that you can usually find a paste option under the File or Edit menu of a program, as well.
 This can usually be found by clicking on the File menu, followed by clicking on Save or Save As.


A Save dialog box will usually pop open as a result.
 Change the file name to something you can remember.


If your graphic editor allows it, you can also change the file type and file location at this point.
 Clicking on this button, or its equivalent, should save your file and complete the process.

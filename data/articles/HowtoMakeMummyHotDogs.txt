, Preheat the stovetop to medium heat and spread olive oil over a frying pan or skillet. Place the ten hot dogs on the pan to cook for about 5-7 minutes, until they are lightly cooked but not thoroughly. Once cooked, remove the hot dogs using tongs and place them on a chopping board.
 Roll out the crescent dough on a clean, floured surface using a rolling pin. Slice the dough into 5 inch pieces using a small, cutting knife.
 Start making the 'mummies' by wrapping three or four of the crescent dough pieces over the hot dog. Tightly secure the dough by pinching the bottom edges. Add a piece of the dough on top of the hot dog and wrap it around. Place the hot dog on a baking tray. Repeat with all the hot dogs.
 Place the baking tray of hot dogs in the oven to bake. Have the 'mummies' bake until the crescent dough cooks and the hot dogs slightly crisp.
 Remove the baking tray from the oven. Place the baking tray on top of a wire rack. Let the hot dogs cool for about five minutes.
 Use the tomato ketchup and Dijon mustard to add a mouth and eyes to the mummies. Repeat with all the hot dogs and serve on a serving plate.

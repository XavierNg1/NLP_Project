 You'll find this in the top row of buttons in the Firebug panel at the bottom of the window, directly to the right of the Firebug Options button. It looks like a box with a mouse cursor pointing at it.
 As you move your cursor over the web page, you'll see different elements get highlighted. Click the one that you want to find the XPath for.
 When you click an element in a web page, it's related code will be highlighted in the Firebug panel at the bottom of the window. Right-click this highlighted code.
 This will copy the element's XPath information to your clipboard.


If you select "Copy Minimal XPath," just the basic XPath information will be copied.
 Once the code is copied, you can simply paste it anywhere else you need by right-clicking and selecting "Paste."

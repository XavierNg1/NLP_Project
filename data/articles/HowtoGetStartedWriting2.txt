 Another way you can get started on your writing to to make it part of your routine. Designate a specific time in your day to get writing done. This could be early in the morning before work or late at night after dinner. You may also use a lunch break or a gap between classes to write. Try to stick to a writing routine, where you have a set time for writing only and nothing else.For example, you may designate the hour before you go to work for writing. Or you may set aside one hour after dinner to work on writing.
 To motivate you to get writing, establish a goal word or page count. Have a goal word count per day or a goal page count per week. This can help you dive into the writing and feel a sense of accomplishment every time you achieve your writing goal.For example, you may have a goal word count of 500 words a day. Or you may have a goal page count of five pages a week.
 To help you feel good about starting your writing, use rewards. Whenever you reach a writing goal, reward yourself to recognize your accomplishment. This could be something small like a piece of chocolate or a cup of coffee. Or you may take a five minute break as a reward to go for a walk or to do some stretches in your chair.


You may also use social events as rewards for getting your writing done. For example, you may reward yourself with a night out with friends once you get a certain number of pages done. Or you may reward yourself with dinner with your partner once you hit a certain word count.

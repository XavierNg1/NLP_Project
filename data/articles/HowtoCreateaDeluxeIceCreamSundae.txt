 You will need: coconut sauce, chocolate syrup, chocolate fudge, rockin' raspberry cheesecake ice cream, and cookies.;
, To make the sauce, squirt a lot of coconut syrup into a bowl. Next, add a little scoop of topping fudge to the mixture. Finally, squirt a little bit of chocolate syrup into the blend. Mix until smooth with a silver spoon.
 Take out your cookies and spoon a liberal amount onto the cookie.
 Drizzle just enough on, or plop a big glob on.
 Keep them there for five minutes at least.
 Don't let them thaw for too long, or the ice cream will melt.
 Enjoy it! Share it with your family and friends.

 Whatever color you are seeking to reduce on your face, find a concealer that is the opposite tone. This is called color correction. You can find a color correcting palette that offers many different colors of concealer or you can buy them individually. In general, you should look for:Green concealer for redness
Peach or orange for dark spots
Purple for sallow skin
Salmon for undereye circles
If you are concealing dark spots, use a concealer that is one or two shades darker than your skin tone. If you are concealing undereye circles, choose a concealer that is one shade lighter.;
, The foundation you use will go over the concealer. You do not need a heavy foundation to cover your dark spots. Rather, find one that matches your skin tone.


Alternatively, you can use a BB cream for a lighter feel on the face. BB cream offers other beneficial ingredients, such as moisturizers, salicylic acid, and SPF coverage, all of which can help reduce your hyperpigmentation as you conceal it.Test out the foundation or the BB cream on your jawline to see if it matches your face. A good foundation will blend into your skin. It should be unnoticeable to the untrained eye.The undertones of your skin can help you find the right shade. If you have yellow or green undertones, you have a warm complexion. If you have blue or red undertones, you have a cool complexion. Try to find a foundation that matches these undertones.
 If your hyperpigmentation takes the form of patches or rash instead of individual spots, you may want to look into getting a tinted primer as well. These primers will help makeup adhere to your face without caking or oxidizing. If tinted, they can color-correct a wide area of your face while providing a more natural look.The same color correction rules apply to primer as they do concealer. That is, use the opposite color to neutralize the hyperpigmented tone.

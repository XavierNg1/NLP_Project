 You can practice by simply writing with any instrument on any paper available. The most important thing is that you gain a steady hand and an understanding of how to vary your line widths. Practicing freely will allow you gain experience quickly and easily, since this can be done anywhere, with minimal materials and little pre-planning.
 If you want to practice a little more formally, you can set up a grid to practice with. Draw a grid lightly, in pencil, with squares roughly 1”x1”. Fill each row with repeated versions of whichever letter you wish to practice until your strokes are even and clean-looking. For some other calligraphy hands like Italic, they are formed using "nib widths". You can learn how to form such calligraphy rules here.
 You can also learn by trying to recreate the work of others. Get images of calligraphy, either from the internet or calligraphy books, and cover the image in tracing paper. Write on the tracing paper, trying to recreate the strokes of the original. If you intend to use ink, be aware that it may bleed through the paper and prepare accordingly.









Because of the issues with the paper bleeding, try to always use cheap photocopies or prints of the work you are tracing. This will keep you from rendering the original unusable.

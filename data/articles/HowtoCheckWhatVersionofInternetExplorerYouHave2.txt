 Older versions of Internet Explorer use a traditional menu system by default, and you can access your version information by clicking the Help menu.
 This is located at the bottom of the menu. A new window will appear.
 The logo will display the general version number you are using, such as Internet Explorer 8. Your exact version will be listed directly beneath the Internet Explorer logo. The longer numbers denote which specific build of the general version you are using.


The latest available version for Windows XP is IE8

 Some pens use standard sized cartridges (small or large), but other pens use proprietary brands that will not accept the standardized sizes.
 To remove the cartridge, simply pull it straight out from the grip section.
 If there is a piston or squeeze converter already in the pen, pull it straight out from the grip section the same way you would a cartridge.
 Insert the stopper end into the grip section. Push firmly until the stopper is punctured and you hear a click. Ink should begin to flow into the pen. , Screw the barrel back on over the body of the pen.
 Hold the pen vertically, nib side down, to let the nib saturate. Place the pen in a small glass or find another means to stand it vertically. It can take up to a couple of hours for the nib to become saturated for the pen to write properly.

 Make sure you know how to check to see the oven is heated properly. Some ovens make a noise, like a beep, when they're done preheating. If your oven does not indicate when it finishes preheating, use an oven thermometer to make sure the oven is heated adequately.As a single serving cake does not take long to mix, it's a good idea to wait a few minutes between turning on the oven and starting your cake. This way, you can put your cake in the oven right after you prepare the ingredients.;
, You need a standard sized mug that's safe to cook in the oven. It should say somewhere on the label if the mug can be placed in the oven. Once you've found a suitable mug, spray it down with non-stick spray.If you can't find a mug, you can use a ramekin roughly the same size as a standard sized mug instead.
 For this cake, you will add all the ingredients at once. Mix the ingredients together until your batter is smooth and consistent throughout. You do not need to use an electric mixer. You can use a fork or a small spoon to stir., Start off baking your cake for 16 minutes. If the cake is not done after 16 minutes, cook your cake for an additional minute. Keep adding a minute onto the cooking time until your cake is done.When the cake is done, it will spring up after you press down on it. You should also be able to insert a fork or toothpick into the cake and have it come out clean.

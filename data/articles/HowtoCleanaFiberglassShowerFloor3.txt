 Soap scum and hard water deposits will have a harder time building up if you clean your shower regularly. Regular cleaning can also help prevent the use of stronger cleaning products to remove tough stains.
 If you notice a stain on your fiberglass shower floor, you should remove it as soon as you can. Removing tough stains and mildew as they appear will help you maintain the shower floor and avoid time-consuming deep cleanings.
 If your fiberglass shower floor is extremely dull or contains a lot of scratches, you can try to restore it with white automobile polish. After cleaning and drying the floor, apply an automotive white polishing compound to the floor. Buff off with a clean cloth.

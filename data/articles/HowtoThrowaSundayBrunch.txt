 You want the weather to be nice and warm.;
, Get a cute tablecloth and leave the place for the centerpiece empty.
 Good choices for a Sunday Brunch food are below.
 For drinks, cranberry or orange juice, coffee, and hot chocolate will work.
 For the sides, chips and guacamole/cheese (Never too early for nachos!), butter, fruit syrup (mix maple syrup and warm fruit), and a fruit salad would work.
 For the main dishes, eggs, pancakes, hash browns, and bacon are classic favorite for Sunday Brunches.
 Even though it's breakfast, there's no reason you can't have a desert! Melt a pot of Dark Chocolate and a pot of White chocolate. Set out plates full of fruit like grapes, strawberries, banana slices, and kiwi fruit for the dunking. Leave kabob sticks so your guests can have chocolate fruit fondue for dessert.
 For a fancy Brunch, metal silverware and glass plates and cups are a nice touch.
 Have the plates and forks and glasses already out, so the table is "set".

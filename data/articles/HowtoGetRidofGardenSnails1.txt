 Snails are most active at night in wet soil. If the beds dry out slightly, your garden will look less attractive to them.


Likewise, if you are setting a snail trap, you should water the garden to encourage them to be active and take the bait.;
, This is where snails hide during the day and lay eggs.
 Place them around the base of plants that snails like to chew. The snails have difficulty sliding over the rough edges of the shells.Garden snails particularly like beans, cabbage, basil, delphinium, hosta, dahlia, lettuce, strawberries and marigolds.
 These include geraniums, impatiens, ornamental grasses, sage, rosemary, lavender, begonias, California poppies, fuchsias and lantana., You can even place a copper collar around plants that are planted in the soil. Snails canâ€™t climb up a thick copper collar.


You can buy copper bands at garden shops, but make sure it is at least six to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) wide.

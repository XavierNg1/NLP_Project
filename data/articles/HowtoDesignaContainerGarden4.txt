 Choose a color scheme that works well with your house and assemble your containers in an attractive arrangement on your front porch. You can even utilize your front porch steps, as well, to create different levels of height., Hanging baskets filled with blooms and vines can look gorgeous all by themselves, so assembling several together can look very striking. If possible, choose a place with a backdrop that will allow the colors of the plants to pop, such as in front of a white brick wall., Tabletop container gardens are popular, especially among those who have an outdoor table situated near their ground garden. The container garden that you assemble on and around the table can create bright focal points. Place the containers on wooden benches and other outdoor furniture to create an aesthetic around height differences.

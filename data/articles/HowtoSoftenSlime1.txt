 Sounds too simple, right? But it's true, some slimes can be revived this way. Put the slime in a bowl, and add a small amount of water to it. You likely won't need more than spoonful. Then just knead away until the slime softens., Another way to soften slime is to add a drop or two of antibacterial gel. The brand doesn't matter. Place the slime in a bowl, and just drip the gel in. Use a spoon to stir it in as well as you can. Then you can knead it until soft. Bonus, now your slime will be bacteria-free (for a while, anyway).You can add more gel if it doesn't soften on the first try.
 Lotion keeps your skin nice and soft, and it can do the same for your slime. Go figure! Just put a spoonful or two in a bowl (four or five pumps if your lotion comes with a pump). Add a splash of water, and mix the two together. Now the fun part! Throw the slime in, and squish it around a bit. Once your slime is covered in the lotion, you can take it out and knead it by hand until it's soft., If you used a recipe that called for glue plus Borax, laundry detergent, or liquid starch, sometimes adding a bit more glue can help the situation. Add a spoonful or so at a time, and knead it in to soften it.

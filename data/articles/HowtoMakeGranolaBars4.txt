, Spread ½ cup of slivered almonds and 1 ½ cups of chopped cashews on a cookie sheet.
 This could take a bit more or less time – just toast them until they turn a little bit brown.
, Set it aside when you’re done.
 Mix 1 ½ cups of rolled oats, 1 ½ cups of brown rice crisp cereal, 1 cup of banana chips, and ¼ cup of dark chocolate chips in a big bowl.
 Once the nuts have cooled, add them to the other ingredients and stir them to combine the flavors.
 Heat 1 cup of brown rice syrup, ¼ cup of Grade B maple syrup, ½ tsp. of salt, and 1 tsp. of vanilla extract together. Stir the ingredients to prevent them from burning.
 This will make the syrup thicken.
 Mix the ingredients together so the syrup covers everything in the bowl.
 Use a spatula or your hands to pat the granola ingredients down so they’re flatly adhered to the pan.

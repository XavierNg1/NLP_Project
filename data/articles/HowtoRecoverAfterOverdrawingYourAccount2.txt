 Look around your home for valuable items that you could sell online or bring to a pawn shop. Consider getting rid of items that you could do without for a little while, such as entertainment systems, musical instruments, antiques, record collections or other valuable items. Try to get as much as you can for the items and use the cash to get your account back in the black., Talk to a close friend, family member or colleague about a loan. See if they are willing to lend you a bit of money, preferably interest free until you are able to get back on your feet financially. Try asking your friend, family member or colleague:“I am currently in very difficult financial circumstances. Is there any way you could help me out with an interest free loan?”

, If you are a member of a church or other social group with a financial assistance program, you should consider applying for help. Try asking your spiritual leader:“Would the church be able to help me out until I get back on my feet?”
“Can the mosque help me out?”
“Would the synagogue be able to help our family at this difficult time?”
“I understand there is a financial assistance program at our center. I have contributed to it in the past. How would I apply for it?”

, You may want to take on another job at night or on the weekends, at least until you are able to bring your account back into the black. Consider your current work schedule and whether there are any hours during the week or on the weekend when you would be able to work additional hours.You could do odd jobs for neighbors such as carpentry or painting, especially if you are good with your hands.
You could do freelance work in your existing sector. For instance, if you are currently working as a writer or an editor, you could take on additional freelance writing jobs.
If you have a service industry background, you could look into waitressing or bartending jobs. See what is available in your neighborhood and try to find something that works with your schedule.

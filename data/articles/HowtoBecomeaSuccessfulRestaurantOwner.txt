 You are not gaining knowledge in the art of cooking so you can interfere with your chef's business, but rather so you understand the needs of a chef. If you can put yourself in your chef's shoes, you can better recognize his strengths and weaknesses, as well as ensure you give him everything he needs to be successful.;

Offer salaries and benefits that are fair because good staff is hard to find and keep, especially a talented chef. Once you have found your chef, sit down with him to create a menu, but allow him to take the lead. Your chef is the head of the kitchen and if you trust him, you should trust his judgment. Give him the benefit of any doubt, until he proves he is incapable.
 A successful restaurant needs to be inviting and relaxing to your patrons and functional for your staff, especially the kitchen. It should be easy to clean and spacious for your customers, although not too spacious so that you are not utilizing your space lucratively.

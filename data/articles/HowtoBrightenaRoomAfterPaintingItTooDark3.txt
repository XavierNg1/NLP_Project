 Dark accessories have the effect of intensifying and highlighting dark paint. By getting rid of dark colored accessories, you’ll make a step toward brightening the room.


Remove accessories that are darker than your wall color.
If possible, replace dark accessories with lighter ones. For example, if you have a black radio, remove it and use a white or silver one instead.
Use rugs to brighten the room. For example, if you have dark rugs, remove them or replace them with lighter ones. If you have a dark floor, add a light rug to the room., By removing clutter or other objects that fill the room, you’ll create the illusion that the room is larger or more spacious. Ultimately, the room will appear lighter, brighter, and more open.


Make sure you don’t have too many things hanging on your wall. For instance, you shouldn’t group more than 4 or 6 pieces of artwork together. In addition, if your artwork is dark, you should consider removing some of it.
Use file cabinets, bookshelves, desks, drawers, or other organizers to declutter and organize things in the room. For example, if you have a lot of books stacked throughout the room, place them all on a small bookshelf.
If you have an excessive number of decorative pieces, decrease the number.
Clean off coffee tables, other tables, and pieces of furniture of paper and other clutter., Depending on the room, you may be able to put up a few mirrors or crystals to lighten and open the room. They will give the appearance that a room is larger and brighter place than it is.


Crystals will reflect light throughout the room. Consider a crystal vase or a similar accessory.
Mirrors work well in dressing rooms, bedrooms, foyers, and hallways. For example, position a mirror opposite of a window to reflect light throughout the room.
In most cases, you’ll only be able to use one mirror per room.
If you install a framed mirror, make sure the frame is not a dark color.

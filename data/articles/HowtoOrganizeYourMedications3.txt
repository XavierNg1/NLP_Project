 Another way to be organized in your medication use is to track your doses to ensure you've taken the right pills each day. There are many ways to do this. One is with a whiteboard or bulletin board.You can post your medication schedule on the bulletin board or whiteboard, and use it to check off each dose you take.
A whiteboard is good for this because you can erase your check marks at the end of the week, or each morning, rather than having to post a new schedule every day or week;however, a whiteboard can also be erased accidentally, resulting in the possibility of missed or extra doses., Another way to track your medication doses and whether or not you've taken them is to put together a three-ring binder with a new page to log each day's doses.Simple medication logs are available online that are formatted to fit a single page. You can just print some out and put them in a binder.An advantage of this method is that it creates a long-term record of your medication doses. You or your doctor can use it to assess your consistency over a long period of time. This can help you determine if your reminders are working or not.
 If you're comfortable with technology, you can also create spreadsheet to track your medication consumption using Microsoft Excel or some similar program.


There are templates available online, or you can just make your own, with a row for each day and a column for each medication., If you are comfortable with cell phone or tablet apps, there are several that will not only remind you to take your medication, but also create a log of whether or not you have taken it.Some of these apps can also provide you with information about the medications themselves, alerting you to possible drug interactions between your medicines. Some of these apps will also remind you when it's time to refill your prescription and can even be used to order a refill.

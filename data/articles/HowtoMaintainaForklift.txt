 Most moving joints, or parts, of the forklift are greased. This is done to prevent the harmful effects of friction. Ensure that all these fittings are greased on a regular basis, making sure to remove all worn out ball bearings.;
, There are various fluids that help the engine and other working parts of the forklift to run efficiently. These include the transmission and hydraulic fluids, coolants, as well as motor oil. Check these fluids regularly, albeit depending on how often the forklift is being used. Daily checks are necessary if the forklift is used on a daily basis.
 Forklifts may be powered by battery, liquid propane (L.P.) gas, diesel fuel or gasoline. If your machine uses a battery, then make sure to ensure that the battery is fully charged always. Also, make sure the tank is always full, if your forklift uses gas or fuel.
 Gauges and lights found on the instrument panel of the forklift give an indication when some part is malfunctioning. Therefore, attention must be paid to these instruments and the appropriate measurements taken, when they indicate any faults. Doing so will forestall more expensive repairs.
 In the process of forklift maintenance, another important aspect that should be checked daily is the tires. If the tires use air, ensure that the correct air pressure is maintained in them. In case the tires are solid rubber ones, make sure that there are not any gashes present. Failure with the tires could lead to an unbalanced ride, potentially leading to damage of the goods being carried.

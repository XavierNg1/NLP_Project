 Just go up to the search bar you see above, and type in Ferret.;
, For instance, something about how to feed a ferret, or how to travel with a ferret, or what kind of cage to use. You don't have to write the perfect article. Since this is a wiki, someone else will come along later and copyedit your work or improve it if it is necessary. What we really need is for you to just get things started!

, Select an article, and scroll down to edit this page. Now you can type, change, and improve or add to the article. After you have finished, just click on save.
 Beef up the body of the article. Add a tip in the TIP section. Advise people of a danger in the WARNING section. Maybe you have a great ferret photo you can upload, or perhaps you can add a link to a helpful ferret site. Just do whatever you can think of to make the article as useful as possible to other people who like ferrets.
, Once we get a few more ferret articles, you might go over to the Village Pump section of the forums and suggest that we add a ferret category.
 It is a good thing that you showed up. Can't wait to see what you come up with!

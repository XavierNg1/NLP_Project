 You want to make sure that you have a firm grasp on your cat before you use the medication. You also want to ensure your cat is as calm and comfortable as you can make it for this process. Hold your cat in way that keeps it relaxed. Use a hold that is as close to your typical hold as possible while still exposing the application area.If you need extra restraint, consider gently wrapping your cat in a warm towel or blanket. This can help calm them while providing extra hold on extremities with claws.
You may also find it helpful to have another person hold the cat while you apply the medication.
 Once you have a proper hold on your cat, apply the medication as directed. Focus on administering the treatment carefully to the necessary areas. Wipe away any medication that leaks from outside of the treatment area. If the medication must dry before your cat can come into contact with other pets or children, continue to gently restrain and calm your cat until the medication has dried.
If you are applying medication to a healing wound, inflamed, or damaged skin, try to avoid rubbing the area too much. Instead, use a finger to lightly dab the medication onto the afflicted area.
 Some medications, such as flea and tick treatment, will not require you to cover up the area of application. If, however, you are applying medication to a damaged or injured area, it may be necessary to apply a patch or bandage. Do so immediately after application unless otherwise instructed.Be sure to use dressing that is made for pets. Those made for humans use adhesives that may catch on fur or skin. Wrapped bandages or patches made for pets are preferred whenever possible.
Keep your pet restrained and comfortable until you have the bandage secured on your cat.

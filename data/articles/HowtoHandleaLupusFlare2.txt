 Corticosteroids are drugs that reduce inflammation. They can also decrease joint pain, inflammation from rashes and headaches. Low doses of oral or topical corticosteroids are often offered as a means of managing lupus cases that do not involve major organ systems.Your physician can prescribe the right corticosteroid and dosage to treat your case of lupus. Ask your physician about potential side effects of the corticosteroid that he or she recommends, and how to manage them.
 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen sodium can help with the pain felt during lupus flares. However, lupus patients are more susceptible to complications caused by taking NSAIDs (including hypertension and renal dysfunction), so discuss this method of treatment with your physician before beginning it., For serious lupus flares, immunosuppressants can be used. In lupus, it has been established that the body's own immune system attacks the body's cells. Immunosuppressant medications can decrease this immune response of the body, lessening its effects., In some cases of lupus, antimalarial drugs can be used to treat joint pain, rashes, fatigue, and other symptoms of flares. Your physician can determine if anti-malarial medications such as hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate may provide you some relief. He or she can also discuss potential side effects, which include:Digestive problems such as stomach, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
Headache and/or dizziness

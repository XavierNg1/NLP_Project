 Battle Palace is located to the south of the Battle Arena. This facility is unique from the others in the sense that you, the Trainer, do not give any commands to your Pokémon in battle. Instead, the Pokémon fight on its own. For each challenge, you battle Trainers with 3 of your Pokémon. Defeating 7 Trainers successively clears one set in the facility. The Battle Palace tests how close you are with your Pokémon., Natures as well as movesets of the Pokémon entered into a Palace challenge can determine how each battle plays out. There are 3 categories that moves can fall in at the Battle Palace:

Support moves: These include non-damage dealing moves that cause trouble for the opponent in the form of causing status problems, lowering their stats, limiting their movement, etc. The only exceptions are Counter and Mirror Coat. Although these moves deal damage, they do so by redirecting the opponent’s power back at them – unlike normal damage dealing moves that utilizes the user’s own power. Examples of support moves are Poison Powder, Nightmare and Curse.
Defense moves: These include moves that benefit the user in the form of raising their stats, providing protection from attacks, restoring HP, etc. Examples include Withdraw, Protect and Heal Bell.
Attack moves: These are just any other moves that do not fit into the two categories above. These moves directly inflict damage on the opponent. Examples include Thunderbolt, Tackle and Focus Punch.
 The Frontier Brain of the Battle Palace is Spenser, also known as the Palace Maven. He is encountered after the 20th and 41st wins in a streak (Gold Symbol). This means that Spenser will be the final Trainer of the 3rd consecutive set through the Battle Palace for the Silver challenge, and the 6th consecutive set for the Gold. Upon his defeat, he will award the Spirits Symbol.

 Place a large saucepan on the range on medium heat. Pour in 2 quarts (1.9 l) of water, 1 quart (0.9 l) of white vinegar and 1 cup (0.2 l) of pickling salt.
 Turn the burner off. Place your brine away from the heat to cool slightly.
 Peel whole garlic cloves. Place 2 cloves in each jar.
 Then, add 1/2 tsp. (1.5 g) of whole peppercorns to each jar.
 You can choose a handful of chopped white onion per jar, 1/4 tsp. (1.5 g) of red pepper flakes and/or 1 tsp. to 1/2 tbsp. (4 to 6 g) of granulated sugar.

 If you don’t have clean nails, you won’t look clean. First, use a nail cutter to trim your nails. Next, use a nail file to soften any sharp edges. If there’s dirt underneath your nails, wash your nails with a soft brush, soap, and water. Alternatively, use a toothpick to scrape any debris out from under your nail.



Scrub away stains by mixing a small amount of baking soda with water to create a paste. Rub the paste on your nails with an old toothbrush and rinse it off.
Resist the urge to bite your fingernails. This can cause fungal infections in your nail beds., If you like looking polished, spend time combing and arranging your hair every morning. This will help you feel and look clean. If you don’t want to spend time on your hair, get a low-maintenance haircut. While you’re at the salon or barbershop, tell your stylist that you’re interested in a low-maintenance hairstyle.For example:


Ask your barber for a short, messy haircut that will look good without any special styling.
If you want a longer haircut from a salon, ask for a style that will compliment your hair’s natural texture. All you will have to do is brush it.
 Make sure you wash your clothes regularly so that you always smell clean. Shirts, underwear, socks, and swimsuits should be washed after every wear. Jeans, pants, and bras can be worn two to three times before washing. However, if you sweat a lot in your clothing, wash it before wearing it again. For example, any clothes worn while you exercise should be washed after the first wear.Hang up or fold dry laundry immediately to prevent wrinkling.

Look on the tag of your clothing for washing and drying instructions.

 This can sometimes be quite complicated but here is a more convenient way to do it.


Visit the PlayStation emulator page again on the EmuAsylum website. This time you need to click on the "PSX CD Plugin Pack," "PSX Graphics Plugin Pack" and the "PSX Sound Plugin Pack" links to download their respective ZIP files.
Right-click each plug-in pack and select "Extract files." However, this time you need to browse to the "plugins" folder (that was created earlier) and extract the files in each plug-in pack to that folder.

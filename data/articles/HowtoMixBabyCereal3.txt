 Once your baby is 6 months old, you can talk with the pediatrician about introducing baby cereal. Fortified baby cereal is a good source of iron, which your baby might begin needing at this point.The doctor should give you specific recommendations about how much cereal to offer and how often you should give it.
 Many babies start with single grain baby cereals, usually made with rice. If your baby enjoys rice cereal, you can also offer oat, barley, or wheat cereals. Always wait three days after introducing a new food before offering another new food. This can help you identify any food allergies or sensitivities.If three days pass with no reaction, you can safely assume that your baby does not have an allergy to the food you tried. Move to the next food, mixing it into the cereal at the same proportion and without another fruit or vegetable.
 Feed your baby a little breast milk or formula before you offer them baby cereal. Before your baby is finished eating, offer the baby cereal. Your baby will be more interested in the cereal if they're not completely full or hungry for milk.Once your baby is done eating cereal, you can offer more breast milk or formula.
 If your baby seems disinterested in eating baby cereal from a small spoon, try offering a little bit of cereal on the end of your clean finger. If your baby still seems uninterested (cries or turns away), don't force them to eat. Your baby might prefer milk or formula for now.You can always take a break from baby cereal and offer it again in another week or so.
Consider making feeding a game. Try flying the spoon around like it's an airplane. Your baby might be so interested in the game, that they'll try the food on the spoon.

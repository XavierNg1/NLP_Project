 The original formula for power focuses on work, as a force times distance, and divides by the time it takes to do that work. Another way to consider the same components is as follows:


Power=Force∗DistanceTime{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}={\text{Force}}*{\frac {\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}}}

By grouping the terms differently, in this way, you should recognize that DistanceTime{\displaystyle {\frac {\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}}} is another way of representing velocity. Therefore, you can conclude that:


Power=Force∗Velocity{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}={\text{Force}}*{\text{Velocity}}}

Consider a 2000 pound car. Moving that car at a speed of 50 miles per hour takes twice as much power as moving the same car at a speed of 25 miles per hour.
 The units of power are generally calculated in either Watts, which are Joules/sec. or Newton-meters per second, or in horsepower (hp) or foot-pounds per second. Recall that 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/sec. If your situation or problem presents data in different units, you will have to convert. Some of the most useful conversion factors are:

1 mile = 5280 feet

1 hour = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds

1 kg = 9.8 N (force)

For the moving car problem, the data is provided in miles, hours and pounds. You need to convert 50 miles into 50*5280=264,000 feet, and convert hours into 3600 seconds. Then you can restate the problem as calculating the power of moving a 2000 pound car at a velocity of 264,000/3,600 = 73.33 feet per second.
 When your data is in the correct format, you can calculate power as the product of force times velocity. For the car problem, this becomes:


Power=Force∗Velocity{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}={\text{Force}}*{\text{Velocity}}}


Power=2000Pounds∗73.33feetsec{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}=2000{\text{Pounds}}*73.33{\frac {\text{feet}}{\text{sec}}}}


Power=146,660foot-poundssec{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}=146,660{\frac {\text{foot-pounds}}{\text{sec}}}}

You can report this as the car’s power, or convert to horsepower by dividing by 550. Power=146,660/550=266.65 horsepower{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}=146,660/550=266.65{\text{ horsepower}}}

The engine exerted 266.65 horsepower in moving the 2000 pound car at a velocity of 50 mph.

 For this tutorial we'll be using a heart shape.;
, You can do this by selecting your shape and then following this path: right-click > transform > scale

, Find the brushes by opening your brush library. Note: donâ€™t apply any brush effect on your first shape. This will serve as the border of your graphic.


You can also be creative by selecting other types of brushes according to your preference and style.
 Adjust the stroke of the first shape to 15 pts, the second to 1 pt, the third to 2 pts, the fourth to 4 pts and then fifth to 2 pts.
 Use colors such as red, pinkish-red, blue, yellow and yellow-green. Follow the combinations written on the image below or choose your own colors.

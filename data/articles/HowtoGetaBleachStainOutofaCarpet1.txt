 If you’ve just spilled bleach on your carpet, there might still be time to save its color if you act quickly. Run a towel or cloth under cold water, squeeze it out, then use it to blot out the affected area.Take care to blot with repeated dabbing motions instead of scrubbing. Scrubbing will force the bleach deeper into the carpet fibers.;
, After blotting the stain with cold water, mix a half tablespoon of liquid dishwashing detergent with a cup (240 mL) of warm water. For larger stains, use the same ratio (for example, one tablespoon mixed with two cups or 480 ml of water) Let it sit for about five minutes.As an alternative to soap, you could substitute distilled white vinegar in the same ratio.
 After five minutes, use a clean, damp sponge or cloth to blot the area you’ve soaked in the detergent solution. Be sure to use cold water to get your sponge or cloth damp.When blotting, work from the outside of the stain toward the center to avoid spread it.

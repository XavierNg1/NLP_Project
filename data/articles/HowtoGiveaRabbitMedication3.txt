 In order to give your rabbit a pill, start by holding the rabbit still. It is a good idea to begin when your rabbit is calm. Simply pick up your rabbit, and cradle them under your non-dominant arm, almost like a football, with their face away from you., Holding the rabbit with your non-dominant arm, use that same hand to gently part the rabbit’s lips. Use two fingers to carefully pry their lips apart. Be ready with the pill in your other hand., Once the rabbit’s lips are parted, swiftly place the whole pill in the back of the rabbit’s mouth. The pill can be inserted through the gap between the incisors and cheek teeth., Allow the rabbit’s mouth to close, while keeping them under your arm. Use your free hand to lean the rabbit’s head back a bit, and gently massage their throat to encourage swallowing., Once you are sure the rabbit has swallowed the pill, be sure to praise them! Pet your rabbit, play with them, say some nice words, and perhaps offer a treat.

 Finance in the form of a loan, such as a personal loan or a loan that's processed by the seller of the TV (big, popular stores usually do this). Approach the staff in the store, and ask if they have finance options. Note that you may need to have a steady income (job, money coming in) to qualify for finance.;
, Most payments can occur monthly or weekly. Pay attention to the interest rate, do some research and compare personal loans of the same value with the finance offered by the store. You might find a better interest rate somewhere else, for the same loan amount. This means you pay less in the long run, and can reduce for monthly payments.
 Double check the terms for the finance, make sure you can meet them, and take your TV home!

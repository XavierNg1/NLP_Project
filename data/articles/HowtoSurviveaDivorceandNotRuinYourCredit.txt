 Closing accounts is the lesser of the two evils in this situation. Closing accounts before you separate will make it easier since your spouse is more likely to cooperate with you. Some financial institutions will require the primary account holder to close the account. If that's not you, then you're going to need the help of your soon to be ex-spouse.;
, This ensures that both parties are individually responsible for their own accounts, which is valuable in a divorce. The crown jewel out of this is you won't have to worry about re-establishing credit on your own...because you will already have it.
 You want to avoid paying any new charges your ex-spouse makes.
 If you cannot pay off the balance, at least try to close the account to prevent any new charges.
 The first thing your attorney will need is a copy of the agreement you signed with the creditor. There are several legal service plans that are cost-effective for this sort of thing.
 The threat of bankruptcy could help your plea. Just be sure you get promises in writing from the creditor. Also make sure they will not report or try to collect on the deficiency balance.

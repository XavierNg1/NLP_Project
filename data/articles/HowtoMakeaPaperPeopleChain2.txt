 The strip can be wider than the first method because you'll need more drawing surface.
 Make the folds as even as possible.


A good trick is to first fold the strip in half multiple times. When the desired rectangle size is met, unfold the paper. Using the creases made from the folding, fold it accordion-style., The person's torso and head will be on the edge. The arm will extend out to exactly the middle of the paper. Be sure to be precise. You can use a ruler to measure the middle and draw a line, or use a stencil. 








The drawing will be the main difference for this type of paper-people chain; it'll give the opportunity for more creativity be giving you the option to use more than one figure for the chain.
 The second person can be different. Try drawing a girl with a dress. Her head and torso will be on the edge. Her arm will extend out to the middle with her hand meeting the other person's. The hands must be touching.








You can be a bit creative with where the hands meet. The hands can hold different symmetrical figures such as a heart, a star, a small child, etc.
 As you trim out the people, make sure the hands stay connected.
 The chain should be boy-girl, boy-girl.









This approach gives you the chance to mix different figures and explore the space on the rectangle. As long as the figures you draw connect, the final product will be a unique chain.

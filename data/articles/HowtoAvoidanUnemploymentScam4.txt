 The most important, yet most frequently overlooked element in the unemployment process is reading the information guide provided by your state’s unemployment insurance agency.


If you haven’t received this information in the mail, contact the nearest unemployment insurance agency office.
 Anytime you file a report with the unemployment insurance agency, be sure to be as accurate and honest as possible.


Doing so will help your claim avoid looking suspicious and will speed the time it takes for your claim to be processed and approved.
 It’s a good idea to keep detailed and consistent records of all your interactions with former employers and the unemployment insurance agency. This way, if there’s ever any discrepancy or controversy surrounding your claim to unemployment benefits, you can set the record straight. When maintaining records, be sure to note the following:


The names of people you talked with from the unemployment agency or at your former employer.
The dates on which interactions occurred, and the content of these interactions.
Note the channel of communication (i.e., telephone, email, letter, etc.).
Keep copies of all relevant written correspondence, whether hardcopy or digital.
 Always remember that there is currently no way to file for unemployment benefits other than to do it for yourself using official government forms, paperwork, and websites.


Anything outside these channels is most likely a scam and should be avoided.

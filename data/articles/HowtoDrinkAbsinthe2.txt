 There are various types of glasses that can be used, some of antique or historical design and others of more modern design. French absinthe glasses, such as reservoir pontarlier glasses, are quite suitable for the French absinthe ritual. Different styles of reservoir glasses are available, but every style will have a distinct or bulbous bottom area that indicates the amount of absinthe that is to be initially poured.;
, This is customary but is not necessary. The sugar is traditionally used to balance the bitter taste of the wormwood.
 This very slow and gradual addition of the water forms the heart of the absinthe ritual, and is done with or without the sugar. When using sugar, the cold water is dripped over the sugar and into the drink, causing the sugar to slowly dissolve into the absinthe. Very high quality absinthe can be expertly experienced simply with the ice cold water.


Three or four ounces of water are added per ounce of absinthe.
Ice cubes can be added to the pitcher of water if desired, but be sure that they don't fall into the glass of absinthe.
As the water is added to the absinthe, the absinthe should gradually louche.
Absinthe fountains were traditionally used to drip the ice cold water into absinthe drinks.
Brouilleur devices can also be used to automatically drip the water into individual glasses. The brouilleur is placed over the glass, and water, ice cubes, or ice water (as well as sugar if desired) is added to it. The water will gradually drip through the brouilleur into the absinthe. The brouilleur is removed before drinking the prepared absinthe.
 Two or three ice cubes can be added to the finished drink, but this practice may be frowned upon by absinthe purists.

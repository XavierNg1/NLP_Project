If your hair is honey-colored, with yellow or orange tones, it is warm, and you should choose a warm-toned hair dye. If your hair is ashy or white blond, it is cool, and you should stick with a cool-toned hair dye.If you have warm-toned hair, try a dark caramel for the lowlights.
If you have cool-toned hair, try a taupe shade for the lowlights.
 You can place the lowlights all over your hair for a more realistic effect while still adding plenty of dimension to your hair.

 The pieces need to be about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide and about the same length as your hair. Fold the top Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) on each piece (narrow side only). This will prevent the foil from scratching you when you put it in your hair., Use a rat-tail comb to create a horizontal part, going from one side of your head to the other. Clip the upper half of your hair up and out of the way and leave the bottom half loose. You can start as high or as low as you want to, depending on how many lowlights you want.If you plan on doing a different pattern, then section off your hair accordingly.
 Grab a thin, 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) wide section of hair from the exposed bottom layer. Weave the handle of the comb up and down through the hair, from one side to the next.

Have the remaining 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) or so sticking off to the side.
 Dip your brush into the dye, wipe off any excess on the edge of the bowl, then brush it onto the hair.

 Fold the bottom half of the foil upward so that all of your hair is sandwiched inside the foil. Next, fold the excess foil over the hair, covering it completely.If you only dyed the upper half of your hair, then you don't need to fold the bottom part of the aluminum foil up.

## NLP Summarization Project

This repo contains the code for the NLP Project in summarization made by Alejandro CASTRO ROS, Salma ELGHOURBAL and Eric Xavier N'GUESSAN.

In the `notebooks` folder, the main code used for the project can be found.

There're also some other folders, such as `logs` with some training logs; `predictions` with the `.csv` storing the predictions made by different models; the `img` folder containing some figures used in the report. Some scripts are stored in `src`.

In order to execute the code is important to install all the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Moreover, one should download the WikiHow dataset and store it in a `data` folder in order to train the models.
